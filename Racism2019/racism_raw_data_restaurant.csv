As we were having our this Senior Lasy with a North Indian background comes to our table and enquires, what was the issue When we politely mentioned it she started an arguement saying ""it's way all Indian restaurants work here"" instead of having any minimal regrets for the delay they have occured in seerving the food. No sooner she starts a rude talk with verbal abuse with racial comments adding up""You bloody Indians"" repeatedly in front of other customers.We were all upset a felt to leave the premises without finishing our food. I have lived than 13yrs in Australia and this is the first time I have seen such a terrible service to customers and a racial abuse from a lady who herself is from a Indian background. I wouldn't advise any of my friends to visit this restaurant,only just because of the way this restaurant treats customers."

The food was great and I loved the authentic traditional indian decorations. I felt very proud to take my inlaws there.It reminded me of my country which I dearly miss. I am from northeast of India from a state called Arunachal Pradesh.However, I was sadly disappointed when the host of the restaurant who was an elderly lady appeared surprised when I introduced myself as an Indian. She commented on my Asian looks and gave a racial remark by saying that all the northeastern Indians look same as Chinese and Nepalese.I consider my self a proud Indian and it is very unfortunate that I have to face such racial discrimination from my own fellow Indian especially in a foreign land. I wish people could leave their discriminatory attitude back in India and not bring it to a multi cultured country like Australia."

I do agree with other reviewers that there is definitely racial profiling going on at this restaurant and as a result, you can be treated differently/poorly by the owner depending on what nationality you are. On our first visit, the owner was quite strange, almost rude but on our second visit, he seemed a little better. Fortunately the waiters seem nice but the food is inconsistent. On our first visit the food was amazing. So much so that we decided to ignore the owners rude behavior and go back for a second meal during our stay in Strasbourg. Unfortunately the second time we went, the food was lacking salt and spices even though we ordered the same exact things. We were thoroughly unimpressed. I'm not sure how many Indian restaurants are in Strasbourg. If there are no others then I would eat here again as the food is decent but if you have other choices then I'd probably recommend giving those a try. Also going back to the racial profiling thing again. The owner not only treats people of Indian decent and maybe others differently but he may also ask you to pay in cash. During our first visit, the owner asked my husband directly to pay in cash when he brought over the bill which we found to be extremely strange and rude. Does he think all Indian's try to evade paying taxes so we'd understand his request Needless to say, the following time we didn't even bother taking any cash and my husband paid with credit card. In hindsight, we probably shouldn't have paid with cash the first time around either."

We requested a recommendation for a nice restaurant nearby for dinner. We were recommended to try I Maroncio. I googled this restaurant and was impressed by the photos and history. Also, I noticed that they had the capacity to serve up to 200 patrons. We drove to the restaurant and arrived at about 8pm. The restaurant looked impressive and we noticed that there were only about a dozen patrons in the entire place. The head waiter greeted us and asked if we needed a table for two to which I replied in the affirmative. He led us to the entrance to the main dining room which we noticed was entirely empty. Upon approaching the dining area we were blocked by a man who seemed to be one of the owners or general manager. He stood in front of us and waved his hands repeating the English word ""full"" over and over again. He would not seat or serve us. The could only be one reason for this behavior, I am a white American and my wife is a black American. My wife was in tears as she had never experienced anything like this in all of our many trips to Europe and travels around the entire United States. I would highly recommend avoiding I Moroncio to any traveler that can appreciate the ugly racial misbehavior we experienced. I must add that we reported this incident to the owner and management of Hotel Roma Sud and they were so upset they called the restaurant and offered to treat us to dinner at the hotel."

I was told by an employee that various playlist could be requested, based upon the managers preference on site. I then asked their events manager and operations manager about my the idea of choosing a playlist and the operations manager automatically responded by saying ""this is a family establishment"" despite the fact that I did not even allude to what type of music I wanted to listen to. As I escalated the issue, their operations and events manager misrepresented the truth to the owner and said I mentioned a ""heavier rap and hip hop"" playlist. Until this organization takes the steps to address how to identify candidates that would potentially be biases, implements the necessary disciplinary actions to avoid it and increases diversity in race, gender and experience within their management team, I will boycott this venue and suggest that you do the same. Any establishment that supports bigotry, racial biases, racial profiling is an organization that will fund and support other causes that are aligned with these perspectives and deserve to go out of business. I addressed this with one of their owners but they took the side of their employees and it is clear that they will not take the necessary next steps to correct this action. It was not communicated on how they will so it's clear that this isn't a big issue to them."

Racial Profiling  Threats,"On June 10, 2018, I am deeply regretful for my hospitality here at Minami Ibiza Japanese Restaurant located in the Ushuaia establishment. Not only was my visit unpleasant but the staff were completely rude. From racial profiling to threatening my friends. The manager at the restaurant called us Fing Monkeys in which my friends are indeed from an Indian background and yelled for us To get the Fing out The issue escalated when the staff begun to become rude and raise their voices at us for no apparent reason but us enjoying ourselves on holiday. We suggested the manager to talk to his rude employee, in which we came at a suggesting point. The manager then becomes hostile and yells at us and states the exact words of You Fing monkeys need to get the F out of my restaurant then the security comes and said to us If we were in the street, Id beat the F out of your A'ss's right now. Is this something we expect to hear as guests Or someone who is on holiday coming here as a place for comfort, dining experience and hospitality Your staff is completely despicable. To treat tourists the way they did that day. I never felt more at risk for my life the way they made me, and my friends felt before. The manager, staff and security of Minami restaurant is a huge disappointment to be established in association with Ushuaia. Please address this situation with your staff therefore this would prevent to happen in the future. Theres definitely no customer service skills or managerial skills and need immediate define training or a new profession. As a manager, instead of bashing a paying customer and guests of Ushuaia. I would suggest appointing an employee of professionalism and listen to their customers instead of racial profiling for the color of their skin and threatening us for being concerned for the type of employees we had to encounter during our visit. Huge disappointment for someone whos paid for nights there and will never return again. This was definitely not worth my money, my time, or my words but the world needed to know what type of establishment this has become during my visit.NOTE: Words have been adjusted due to TripAdvisor's profanity policy."

It appears that certain Berrys' employees have no fear using racial slurs in the presence of a customer. That is unacceptable. I will never go there again. And no, we didn't eat their food."

The ceiling was literally collapsing, old dilapidated pictures hang crooked on the wall, and the decor is totally stuck in a time warp not in a good ""retro"" kind of way. The air conditioning/heating ducts are covered in a thick layer of dust, blowing right above your head and food. All of that could have been forgiven had we received decent service.The appetizers arrived not too long after and were decent.The food is definitely overpriced, with prices much higher than the average prices of better restaurants in more central parts of Israel. The mains were disappointing. The chicken was so dry and overspiced. The fish was alrightnothing to write home about. HOWEVER, it took forever for the mains to arrive. It was the middle of the week and the restaurant was fairly empty, yet we waited over 30 minutes. Anytime we wanted something and tried to call the servers over, they either ignored or didn't notice us. The waitress there was completely apathetic, as if she wanted to be anywhere but there. We had to get up and go get them several times. When they brought the menus, nothing was explained. Not once did they check on us to ask how everything was.What was most frustrating was a group that arrived a good 30 minutes after us received all of their food, including mains, right away. After reading the mix of very negative  very positive reviews here, it is quite clear this is an old neighborhood restaurant with a lot of local regulars who've been patrons of the restaurant for decades. The regulars are a priority  seem to receive excellent service and attention from the wait staff, while the tourists and newbies are relegated subpar virtually nonexistent service. We noticed a reviewer made allegations of racial discrimination, but I would simply call this discrimination against new customers. Really, we cannot understand how this restaurant is still around with such horrible service except that the service for newbies vs. the longtime local patrons is night  day.We are not picky at all and rarely do we feel the need to write a review, but the service was so bad, I would urge anyone to think twice before dining there."

NonVegetarian Food Despite Requesting for Vegetarian Food,"I went to Pong Buffe last Saturday, March 30th. I feel sorry that I did as I had my 1st experience of racial discrimination in Sweden, ironically at a Thai Asian restaurant. Not just that, their kitchen can't be trusted and the staff is rude, irresponsible and talks as if they are doing a favour by letting people eat in their restaurant. I specifically mentioned that I am a vegetarian but was served chicken soup despite several reiterations from my side while placing the order. Please read below the complete experience of the humiliating experience I had.I entered the restaurant and asked the girl at the counter if I could have vegetarian food, as I am a vegetarian. She said it was possible. We discussed the menu for 12 minutes and she went inside. I kept waiting but when she did return for sometime, so I went inside assuming she must have gotten busy serving other guests. This is what happened then:1 I went inside and sat on a chair when another staff a young boy came rushing to me and told me that I can't sit there in a room full of people. When I asked him the reason, he said it was reserved. When I inquired why I could not see any ""reserved"" sign on the table if that was the case, he went back and the girl who I had spoken to earlier came back and repeated the same. I asked the same question on reservation signs missing. She then said that I can't sit as I have not placed any order which is what I was BTW waiting for as I was hungry. I told her that that's what I would like to do and that the staff should not behave and talk in this way to their guests. I again confirmed that I am a vegetarian and I don't eat even eggs, fish or fish oil and ordered my food soup and fried rice to get started with.2 The same girl came in sometime and plonked a water bottle very rudely and said ""you can have water if you want.""3 The guy who told me earlier that I could not sit there came back with the food I had ordered. I tasted rice and found the rice to be completely bland despite my requesting in advance if they could make it spicy for me. I was still fine thinking that may be that's how rice are cooked there. I then tasted my soup and spotted some weird chunks. I called the same person again to check. He came after a while and confirmed it was chicken. I felt disgusted in my mouth and stomach at that moment. When I confronted him on what was happening  why was I served nonvegetarian food and earlier told that I could not sit  he told me that now indeed I could sit there. Wow, I felt so grateful for being allowed to sit to have food which I abstain from!! I asked him to call his manager so I could speak to him.4 Their manager, David, came and I told him about what had happened. He told me it was kitchen's mistake as they overlooked the note written by the waitress and that I don't need to pay for the food  he repeated this 23 times. I found this to be so funny and outrageous at the same time  I would have appreciated some sensitivity here. He said while he was sorry, humans can make errors and I should cooperate just the way he was cooperating with me! I still don't understand how he was cooperating with me perhaps by letting me in or letting me sit to order for paid food  what a big favour! I told him it was very irresponsible on the staff and kitchen's part to attempt to humiliate their guests and serve them what they abstain from.5 I got up and walked out with my head held high someone who was traveling abroad for the first time would have perhaps very humiliated and embarrassed without any fault of theirs. Clearly my trip to Sweden was marred with this experience and not to mention the pukish feeling I had that entire day."

Racial Hypocrisy!!,"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. Now this is the second time I've had problems with this place and it will be the last!!! Me and a group of friends and family came here to celebrate a 21st birthday. Before even coming, I emailed a woman named Kayla, who is a hostess at the IO Godfrey. I asked her if there was any kind of list we needed to be on because there was a group. She told me no, but people with table reservations would be seated first. That's understood!! Then, the manager Ashley emailed the birthday girl of our group and told her there is no list, we would be able to come, but it would be standing room only. Ok, that's understood again. As soon as we walk in, they have the door manager BRAD, who was extremely rude from the very beginning, who basically wouldn't let us in because we were a ""large"" group. He said it was policy and on the website, which was his first lie, because I have yet to find the policy and he couldn't even show us. Then, said the space isn't made for large groups to congregate. BUT if we wanted to pay for a table then we could go up and congregate. So you're telling me your establishment is not made for big groups, but if we buy a table you can accommodate a big group Hmmmm how stupid does that sound Now you're lying to me again, BRAD. Then, he said they can't just have us all standing around congregating. I'm sorry, what difference would it make if we all came in pairs of two or four once we were in the lounge, we still would have been socializing together because IT'S A LOUNGE AND PEOPLE SOCIALIZE!!! Then BRAD makes a statement about people not buying drinks. Now we're getting somewhere, BRAD!!! I completely understand it's about money, but for you to automatically assume that because we are a group and we didn't pay for a table, which we didn't want anyway, that we would go up and not buy drinks is extremely insulting. You know what they say about assuming! Like we seriously were here to celebrate a birthday. What would make you think we weren't going to buy drinks So, next we asked for the manager Ashley, just to get clarification and BRAD said she was upstairs and didn't want to come down. Not understanding, if she's a manager why wouldn't she come down That's bad business and customer service on her part. THEN TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE.... as we are standing trying to understand BRAD's logic, he literally let a whole GROUP of 10 people, who I will state were all Caucasian, in to go up right in front of us and guess what!! They didn't have table reservations, because we made sure to ask them as they all were filing in line. But since they knew somebody there, they were allowed to go up. Hmmm now, there is a bigger problem. Oh and interesting enough someone in our party was actually texting Ashley about what was going on, and she stated that she wasn't even on the premises. Hmmmm so who is lying and what is the reason for lying This is my second time having an issue with this establishment and the last. Not wanting to make this a racial issue, but it clearly is and in 2019, people will not tolerate the disrespect. Our group gladly took our money to Sound Bar Night Club and the birthday girl had an amazing 21st birthday. That was your final time, IO Godfrey, and I will make sure to make others aware of how you treat people who just want to come and have a good time like everyone else!"

We had reserved a table online for Pla for dinner at 7:00 p.m. on 7th October, Sunday. We receive an email confirmation and have also provided two separate phone numbers with our booking. So at 6:55 p.m. when we reached there, we find the place empty. We asked the manager/ attendant for our reservation and he pretended not to understand the name in which the booking was made, so we spelled it out for him. He again insists that he doesn't have that booking. By then we are able to see his computer with the list of reservations and we spot our name and his reaction is that, ""oh, sorry this booking seems to have been cancelled"". So we say that we have received a confirmation email and we were not contacted regarding any cancellation and if he could accommodate us anyway. He apologized saying that its according tot he computerised system and they were fully booked despite the fact that till then not a single table had been occupied. Anyway during this time one of us decided to use the washroom and the rest of us stepped out to wait. We realised that his attitude was very strange and yet we did not want to spoil our vacation by arguing with a restaurant manager in another country. One of us went upto him and gave him our piece of mind in English and that how it reflected rather poorly on their service and So we asked him for another recommendation which we found to be extremely third rate and would have never even stopped to see the menu of had we been in our country. Nevertheless we left the place having given our number to the manager/ attendant. Soon after within ten minutes, we got a call from the manager/ attendant saying that the table was available. This attitude was highly shocking as to how the sequence of events played out. Ultimately we concluded that the entire incident was a case of racial discrimination as it was extremely strange as to how the confirmed reservation could get cancelled without us getting any information. I would give this place a zero rating and not recommend to anyone. Irrespective of how the food may have tasted here."

Compared to us they were of a different race, and better dressed than us. I hope this is not racial discrimination because frankly, other than that I see no reason why we were treated differentlyIt is sad because I have thought highly of this restaurant before I came here."

At this point, the person who kicked us out, followed us outside, and started shouting out profanities. He then grabbed my friends drink and started pouring it out while swearing at us. This is when I realized that he was intoxicated. We were shocked and appalled but kept our thoughts to ourselves and apologized again and told him its ok, we will just stay here. He then goes inside, and grabs all our group from inside, including our friends who were already there, and tells us we are not welcomed there and that we are all the same.

All he requested was to go in and check at our table it the over smart discriminating bouncer refused to even let him go in there why cause his skin was brown, but when another white friend of ours went in to check he was not even stopped or asked any questions.... Does this sound fair, shame on you Times, that even in this day n age you have employees like that discriminating bouncer n then there are the amazing servers like Zac who need to teach these arrogant bouncers that they are there thanks to all the customers.

However, for me today it turned out really shocking when one of the waitress said we could cut the cake only if we order some coffeewe already had food and drinks worth114 euro.When we tried to approach another waiter he tried to diffuse the matter by saying he is not the boss and he can not change the rule. I really wonder if such a rule even exists.. it marred our evening: I really felt discriminated and disgusting with so called hospitality received from members of the staff and worst of all none of us were given at least a farewell bid by any member of the staff. Totally rude and snobbish guys. After this experience I sincerely think that I would not visit such a racially biased place again......Totally disgusting experience in this beautiful Dresden valley.

They complained about us sitting at our own table and got more quarters from the bar to play at a different machine. When the waitress came back over to bring their drinks, I was quite surprised to hear what she had to say.""I guess I'm more use to Endzones, it's more like Puerto Rican zone in here"" ""I guess Jukebox was all filled up""So, one of my best friends that was with me is Puerto Rican, she was obviously referring to him. This seemed totally out of line and uncalled for in my opinion, especially in the middle of the entire restaurant. This bothered me for about 5 minutes as I decided whether or not to seek out management, which i did.They apologized and offered me a drink, not the remedy I was looking for. A few minutes later another manager came over and asked me to explain the story again, I did. She apologized and stated that the girl was going to be sent home, and this wasn't the first problem they had from her this evening. Well, an hour later she was still there, still serving. Evidently Langel's does not take this seriously, and I'm disappointed to say did not take action. They won't be getting any more of my business."

We cut through the store and I let him walk around Northtown until he gets tired. When I cut back through Best Buy, sometimes I stop in the bathroom to wash his hands. But I can count a handful of times when a worker just happens to come into the bathroom a few minutes after I go in. Now it takes me longer because I am washing my kids hands, putting him back in his stroller, and sometimes using the bathroom. I get why one may be suspicious when they take a little longer. But today I was pretty annoyed. Guy came in right as I was strapping in my kid, I had to check to see if he was really peeing or checking on me, I walk out and their is a guy with a headset getting a drink of water. If this was my first experience at this best buy, I'd think it was maybe a coincidence, but it was like my 5th at least. I used to work security, I understand how security systems operate, and how the bathroom is a good spot to steal stuff. But let me break it down, just because I have darker skin doesn't mean I have plans to steal something from your store. I wonder if the employees treat every white boy that uses the bathroom this way, always checking up on them I have been a customer in the past, I purchased a 300 camera set from your store, but after this most recent act of racial profiling, I hope no people of color choose to present their business to your store. It is one thing to live in white privilege above the minorities in society, thus I have accepted. But when you have to come at me purely because of the color of my skin; because I look more suspicious than a white person, its unacceptable. The last time I can remember taking something that wasn't mine was in the 2nd grade, it was chalk from a teacher, it was stupid, I felt really bad, but theft is not an issue for me. I try to keep doing my thing, accepting society for the way it is. But when I have to engage in the subtleties of Racism, it becomes challenging to look the other way, to forget the inequalities we live in daily. I definitely know it's a business I will not be supporting in the future."

We visited Sushi Masa on Sunday, September 14, 2014 at approximately 12:00 pm. We were escorted to a booth in the very back of the restaurant where we could not be seen by customers. When I requested to be seated in a different section near the front, the hostess and server both told me that the section was closed. However, there was only one other family of the same size as mine in the entire restaurant. This other family was allowed in the front of the restaurant near the entrance where we had requested to be seated. When I brought that to the attention of the hostess and server, they rudely told me that every section in the restaurant was closed and only the booth they had offered me was opened. We ultimately left and went to another restaurant nearby. It is unfortunate that while a white family was allowed near the front, my family was restricted to a certain circumscribed area of the restaurant on the basis of our race. Sushi Masas action led me to believe that Sushi Masa is involved in the practice of unlawful discrimination and racial segregation."

But, I came so far  was hungry plus she made me pay up front. I was not sure she would give me my money back. She was the cashier/waitress. Also, I think she made me pay for my meal first before serving me because I'm African American while I noticed after I paid for my meal, this causian guy told her what he wanted, didn't pay, sat down, eat some of the food, then he got up, looked around  looked at me  walked out, I believe without paying. So, you see when bias is shown the wrong assumption can be made. The point I'm making is, everyone should be treated equally. I'm surprised this took place in a mexican restaurant when lately hispanic people know what it's like to be judged unfairly. In saying this, she was not rude, was pleasant but I felt she did practice racial profiling here!"

I questioned her service and racial profile, and then she said we did not want to serve you. I almost wanted to call the police if there were not a few of nice Korean people came out and serve us. It is shame that this restaurant did not even understand courtesy of baby and senior is the base of our Canada culture.This lady apologized to us after we gave big tip after dinner.

Midway through our dinner, the dining room became full. And we realized that ALL the tables were asian customers. We just thought, a restaurant in Richmond Hill, just attracted a lot of asian customers. However, I took a trip to the washroom which was located in the other dining room and noticed that EVERYONE was either white or black. Not a SINGLE asian customer. It was so blatantly obvious that I had to stop and look around just to make sure I was not mistaken. I was definitely not mistaken. The dining room on the right were for NONASIAN customers, while the dining room to the left were ALL ASIAN customers. WOW!!! Talk about racial segregation at its finest!What an insult...Would I ever go back Not after the way we were treated."

At first it seemed promising but once seated the waitress took our drink orders, brought them back, took our food orders and then never came back to our table. For our food order we asked for a salad without tomato and a pot roast meal but not on bread. When she came back 35 mins later with our food it was totally wrong as if she completely just disregarded everything we said. When I asked her what went wrong she just proceeded to start laughing at me. From that point I just wanted to leave, I debated for a few minutes and then left out the resteraunt. As I was pulling out the manager on shift DIANE was standing on the sidewalk. Thinking that she was coming out to apologize or see what the problem was I stopped on the side to converse with her and the first thing out of her mouth was I needed to come and pay for food THAT I NEVER TOUCHED! She never greeted me or asked me what this issue was she just told me I needed to pay very assertively with a extremely unkind tone. I explained to her that I was appalled by her terrible customer service but that I did not touch anything and I waited 35 minutes for food that was ALL WRONG so I will not be paying for it. She never offered to fix this problem. As I was pulling out of the lot she screamed fck me  some racial slur that I would rather not repeat so I pulled back in to properly address the situation. The way that I was treated by her was completely inexcusable and disrespectful! I am totally shocked by this situation and can only hope that Eat n park comes to check on the quality of their employees because this was totally unacceptable!"

I was the first to enter. I made eyecontact with one of the white waiters. The young man was standing by their POS, looking at the door. He sized me up, and swiftly looked away. He remained grounded where he stood... untill my white friend walked in from behind me. I could have sworn the waiter was hit by a bolt of electricity. He lept from behind the counter and rushed to ask my friend if he could seat him. ""Did you make a reservation Actually, it's fine. How many are in your party How about this corner...""He was extremely friendly... except he spoke exclusively to my friend. Made no eye contact with me and barely acknowledged that I was there. All this while I stood directly in front of him my friend was still behind me. We left soon after. See the insidious thing about racial microagressions is that they're, more often than not, very difficult to prove. In fact, had my white friend not asked me about the interaction soon after we left, I wouldn't have mentioned it to anyone.This city is full on spaces like these where dogwhistle racism is allowed to manifest and I'm committing to calling it out now. Do better.P.S.Going for breakfast there was actually my idea.I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends: black or otherwise."

I was meeting up with a friend from Indonesia who has a scholarship to study in the US funded by the US state department. My friend was wearing his traditional Indonesian dress, a shirt with a sarong that was handembroidered on his island, and I was dressed ""normally"" by American standards. He's also a 50 year old dude, so in no way ""underage."" When we approached the restaurant around 9:30 PM, there was a security person who told us that the restaurant was ""no longer serving food."" I was confused because I could see people eating inside of the restaurant. I asked if I could go in and ask the servers if the kitchen was still open, and he told me that I could go in, but my friend could not. I then explained that my friend was Indonesian and wearing traditional Indonesian garb, and that all he wanted was to do was eat a bar b q sandwich! After more back and forth like this, he finally allowed us inside.I am disturbed by the unabashed racial profiling found at this restaurant. I, a tall white woman, was told that I could enter the restaurant, but my short, Indonesian friend was told that he could not. This resulted in an incredibly uncomfortable experience, especially for my friend, who left feeling unwelcome and unsettled. Had I not promised my friend a bbq sandwich for dinner, I would have gone elsewhere after that ordeal.I have no idea if this is a restaurantwide issue our server was totally fine, or simply one member of the personnel, but I would think twice if you are a person of color considering visiting this establishment. Might save you some grief and frustration."

He went back because he found the prawn curry nice that he had the week before. My father ordered food. The waitress goes away and talks to who must have been a manager. Suddenly the waitress comes out with a eftpos machine and asks for the meal to be paid for without even recieving the meal. However my father said that he might want a desert later. The waitress goes away again to the guy behind the bar, and comes back and asks that his card be held behind the counter. My father asks why, as no one elses card had been asked for, and we had never been asked for our cards the week before. The waitress proceeds to say its their rules while the ginger man behind the bar watches intensely. To save face my father gives it over...eats his meal and then pays and leaves.This is blatant racial profiling and is unfortunate that it is still alive in NZ. Despite having respectable jobs and dressed appropriately etc we are still treated in this unsavoury manner. I have told colleagues and friends of this unfortunate incident and will never step foot into this place again. "

Please read!!Zero stars! Our family experienced strong racial profiling at the Ketch on 7/14. We took our son and a party of 14 to celebrate his birthday. As we were leaving, a few of us were told you can not take your drink down the stairs. One member of our party was black. Battista  the owner handled him very differently. It was so difficult to watch. He was told not to take his drink downstairs, he responded that he understood. He then turned around and attempted to return to the upper level. The owner told him to leave the premises and then took his drink from him and crushed it in his hands! It was aggressive and hostile. Several in our party challenged the owner asking him to explain his behavior. This was done peacefully. He told us all to leave immediately and threatened to call the police and have our son arrested. The police arrived and told Battista they had no reason to arrest him. The police told our son he could file a complaint. Which we hope to do. We left the establishment and went to the Marlin, not realizing it is the same owner. We were all sitting down when Battista entered the bar and went over to the manager, pointing at us. We all agreed to avoid a problem we would leave. When we got outside there were more police cars. Battista again told the police to arrest our son. And again the officer told him he has no grounds to arrest him. Our son's friend's first time on our beautiful LBI was horrific. We were embarrassed and mortified. Our family has had a family home on this island for many many years. We will not only file a complaint but also tell everyone we know to please ban these 2 establishments, plus his liquor store  attached to the Marlin. We have much of this on video"

As he was walking away, he shouted a racial slur in reference to me and loudly complained that I had been sitting there all night. I was the only African American in the restaurant and we had been seated for no more than 10 minutes. Shocked, my friend and I whispered and confirmed that we had indeed heard what we thought we had. We looked around and saw the two women's faces whose astonished expressions further confirmed what we had just heard. Needless to say, we did not stay. Not only did we not feel welcome, we did not feel safe. In effect, we were denied service because I'm black. I will certainly never be going back."

As I was walking through the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, I was quite impressed with the setting and the layout of the restaurant and bar. The menu also looked very appetising. However, soon after I was seated I quickly realised that I had made a mistake as I felt very unwelcome by two members of staff. Only the waiter who invited me in to have dinner acknowledged me during my visit to the restaurant. I sat for over 15 minutes before my order was taken. During my wait, one female waitress just looked at me, looked off and pretended I didn't exist while doing absolutely nothing. Her male colleague did the exact same thing. Their other colleague seemed quite annoyed when he realised that his colleagues were seemingly ignoring my presence and came over and promptly took my order. I ordered the Lasange alla Bolognese for dinner which was served in a reasonable time. The meal was indeed very tasty and filling and was 22. The mistake I made was ordering a CocaCola to discover when I got the bill that it cost me 9 for a can! What a rip off. The other annoying thing was the cover charge of 7 which is levied on each customer. Overall, my dinner of lasagne and one CocaCola cost me 37.50 and a share of mild racial abuse. This will NEVER happen to me again and I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone! There are much better places in the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II to eat. I also absolutely regretted not taking out my Trip Advisor app on my smartphone to check the reviews on this restaurant. If I had, I would have seen the 1.5 rating it had out of 5 stars. Once again, STAY AWAY and save your money on something better. I actually think the 2 stars I've given is very generous."

The reason cited by the doorman was that we were required to return with two females. This is what subsequently transpired:1. We peacefully removed ourselves from the line but requested clarification of the rationale and were advised that The Long Bar was only permitting a ratio of 1:1 male/female to enter.2. We deliberately observed over time that this was not the case as the doorman allowed fair coloured Australian males to enter without women, as well as groups of females. 3. Notwithstanding the above, we reentered the queue with 4 females as a group and were again denied entry.4. If this was not insulting enough, on questioning the seemingly discriminatory behaviour of The Long Room, the same doorman went further and proclaimed that we were as ""dumb as we looked"".As two Australian born professionals with Master level degrees and Italian parenthood, we found this whole incident to be absolutely degrading, derogatory and discriminatory. This was clearly evident to certain females in the line that witnessed the exchange and felt the need to apologise to us in embarrassment.For the avoidance of doubt, we were not intoxicated and complied with the dress code which was never disputed. This kind of discriminatory treatment should not be tolerated. I note from reading a recent previous review of The Long Room that it appears this is not an isolated incident and I am aware that such experiences can be shared by email to longroomcomplaints@gmail.com"

However, there was another white male customer who suddenly appeared and stood near the counter, a female staff completely ignored me and asked him what does he need. I waited for about 5 minutes until the female staff gave the drinking that the male customer needed. I think it should be my turn now, however, at the moment another white female customer came and just stood near me, the female staff member completely ignored me again and asked the white female customers what she needs. Finally, I gave up the order and left the restaurant. In the process, I waited for 20 minutes in front of the counter, and the two female staff totally ignored me in the process. Obviously, this is a kind of racial discrimination.

How can one waiter say there is a table the restaurant was moderately busy. Tables clearly vacant! Really disappointed as a born and bred Glaswegian to witness that this restaurant would actively racially profile! Very disappointing!!!

The lodging was excellent and available separately as a review.This restaurant which is part of the lodge, was very poor. Inquiring twice, the restaurant could not find nor attempted to find a table for us on 2 of the nights we inquired.Asked twice, denied twice by the staff.Both times, the hostess looked at us and said wryly that no tables were available.I even informed them that we were guests in the lodge.The hostess did not even check the reservations list  she just said they were fully booked.After being denied the second time, surprisingly I found that there were open tables available  I checked on Open Table online and found multiple openings available. On the second night, there were 5:15, 5:30, and 9pm seatings available.A restaurant who has guest at their lodge should go to great efforts to accommodate their guests as they are the ones who paid for the stay.When I saw other guests being served outside the restaurant front lobby who did not have reservations, I was shocked that the hostess did not offer to serve us as well. I was quite shocked at observing racial discrimination in a resort location in a highly democratic state like California.This led me to conclude that the staff who were white did not want Asians in their restaurant. My recommendation:Use Open Table to make a reservation.If you are non white, don't ask personally for a reservation."

We were totally ignored by the staff  no welcome, got our table on our own, had to fetch the menu card, and no one took our order. I had initially asked for a dessert menu card and the waiter simply dropped the dinner/snack menu at our table without even acknowledging us. Given that we couldnt catch the attention of any waiter, I had to go pick up the right card on my own at the cashier. The manager said someone would come to wait on us, but almost 10 minutes later, we thought it was a hopeless case and that we were blatantly being ignored. So we decided to leave. Eventually shared my thoughts with the manager who proposed complementary dessert  but no way I could accept that! I explained that I could afford to pay for my consumption. Whats shocking is that tourists were eagerly welcomed by the manager and staff and led to their tables. Menu cards were handed to them promptly. The 2 tables next to ours were waited on multiple times whilst I tried my best to get their attention. In this day and age, some still believe locals are second grade people without the purchase power or do not deserve to be there. Suggestion: please post a sign saying people of the wrong skin colour are not welcome."

Im going to start with finding a hair in one of our pizzas, which was taken away with no apology and a fresh one returned. Ironically this was the least horrible thing to happen during the lunch. This incident was followed by watching the staff simply rinse cutlery No soap and towel dry them and hand them to us. The over all hygiene of the restaurant was poor, there were flies everywhere, and the toilets in particular were disgusting. Yet not as disgusting as the attitude of one waiter, Seus, who when when I asked where the pealla was as we had been waiting over 35mins for it, and had not been told when ordering that it had a minimum waiting time of 20 mins and this is also not printed on the menu he responded rudely that it was coming and walked past us muttering under his breath in spanish. Eventually when the paella came, he came over to the table raised his voice at me yelling 'Minimum 20 mins!!', completely embarrassing us and even had his colleagues looking at him in shock. At this point we asked for the complaints form as this behaviour and the hygiene was unacceptable. Whilst filling in the form, Seus carried carried on walking past our table stomping his feet and still muttering under his breath, and even dropped a dirty napkin on one of the pizzas, whilst we saw this was not done intentionally  its not like anyone is going to finish any food a dirty napkin has fallen on. After filling in the form and passing it Seus to write his counter side, he read over it and came over to argue with us about what was written!! Suddenly he spoke english!! I told him we did not want to argue with him, that he should just fill in the form. Annoyed at being dismissed, he mostly directed his anger at me Being portuguese, I spoke the most broken spanish of the three of us He shouted 'you are crazy' several times across the restaurant and that I should ' Go back to your country' 'go back to Portugal' Absolutly disgusting behaviour!!! We were in disbelief at what was happening! At this point we took our half of the complaints form and walked out."

When I told the BS guy that I am not someone under his employ and he can't yell at me to pick up stuff for him, he called the manager. Instead of assessing the situation and checking what happened, the manager asked me to stop yelling. Maybe if the manager climbs off his high horse he could discipline his staff and teach them to maybe not be racist, belittle and order customers."

We reached the restaurant at around 715 pm for dinner. The restaurant was completely empty and we could see empty tables around. We were 3 of us and requested for a table for 3. The waiter told us that there is no space in the restaurant. We looked around and told him that all the tables were empty. He said that there will be people coming in by 9 at the restaurant and so he cannot offer us a table. They did not want coloured people to sit at their restaurant and we had a requirement for vegetarian food. Basically they wanted people who would drink and create a huge billing for themFirst time that I ever experienced this kind of treatment in a foreign country. Would strongly recommend everyone not to visit this restaurant ever. The food is also very very average as per the reviews from a few friends and over priced. Pls pls do not visit this restaurant.

We entered this venue, Staff instantly walking past myself and friend; not making eye contact, not responding to queries  opting to shuffle table cloths or adjust chairs at empty tables instead of attending queuing customers.We waited 10 mins as a table for 2 behind one couple. It could be clearly seen that several tables were FREE part of the reason for walking IN, in the first place. The couple waiting the same length of time plus two minutes ahead of us were invited to sit at a fourseater table. At the same time several fourseater tables were available.The Head Waiter/Manager returned to myself and friend and told we need to wait 30 minutes. ALL bar one table of the ground floor fourseater  twoseater tables from kitchen to the door were EMPTY  I will even post a picture to this review to prove it!Waited 10 more minutes, one couple who were seated and ate beforehand got up and left, another vacant table for four was revealed.....then told by the SAME waiter: ""we're not serving you the door is open"".I looked around and then a bundle of excuses were created:i you left the door open which was not the case, because the couple who had only recently left had done so, and I had closed the door on the way in, as I held it open for my companion;ii we still have bookings coming in which was worse as it was not busy and was not near 40 capacity to deny a spot for 2 people who waited 20 minutesiii just silence......when asked why the pair of us could not sit at any of the TEN tables on the ground floor alone.I looked around and had noticed that the seated patrons were entirely white, the couple seated before us was white male and white female and I was the ONLY person black male not receiving any kind of eye contact or service. My Italian friend was confused and did not understand. I clearly understood what was going on.Disappointed that this still goes on and I don't know how you can treat customers like this in such an ethnically diverse area. Shame on you and your representation of Italians. It will also be clear to people who read La Forchetta reviews from 2010 to 2018 that the only people who appear to be served at La Forchetta are not just largely, but ONLY from one ethnicity. Even THIS Trip Advisor site is not carrying a nonwhite review I checked at the time of writing.You will not be getting my custom and I will be notifying my others of how you treat patrons. According to your reviews it appears to be a regular occurrence, specifically if the Google Reviews are to be read as a comparison. Wholly disappointed."

Avoid sitting anywhere near the entrance or exit doors.FoodI love Sichuan food. The quantity was reasonable, but the taste was average. It was more oily than all other Sichuan places I have eaten and less spicy than others. Also, there was very less meat. The house special version of a dish is around 8 more than the regular version of the same dish. There was nothing special about the two special dishes we ordered. Avoid ordering special dishes.ServiceWe waited for about 20 mins to get our tea. That is the first thing that should have been served. We had to ask 5 times and 3 different people for the tea. We never got water despite asking for it. So we had to finish our dinner without water. Throughout our meal no one came to ask us how the food was or if we needed anything. The restaurant was not even half full. I was with 2 of my Chinese friends and we all agreed that there was lot of favoritism being showed. Especially, the Chinese customers were ignored. After we were done with the food, it took us another 15 mins trying to get hold of someone who can get us a check. Due to the bad experience, my Chinese friend decided not to tip.So far I cared less about this whole experience. But what happened next prompted me to give this review. One of the waitresses came outside the restaurant and started abusing my Chinese friend in Mandarin on the road, making racist comments for not tipping and creating a scene. I picked up my mobile to call the cops, but damn, it was dead. While I took my friend's mobile to call the cops, she started walking away."

Even though I had not had anything to drink that night, the bartender refused to serve me on the grounds of being too drunk to be served a state that I have never been in, since I rarely have more than one drink on occasion and accused me of being belligerent when I questioned her reasoning. She proceeded to serve all the other white customers, some of whom were actually visibly inebriated and one of whom visibly under the legal drinking age. I have never experienced such inexplicably discriminatory hostile behavior. I would like to think that it wasn't my race but because she didn't like my voice or my outfit.

We walked in, looked around, and after a moment of confusion we were pointed to just go to the other side of the restaurant by a waitress at another table; she was not specific and I felt odd being directed in such a manner. I should have turned around and left at that point. Instead I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she was busy. We sat down and a different waitress dressed the same brought us menus and took our drink order. Drinks came; family and I ordered; I asked for the daily special, a chile relleno. Another two tables were seated after we ordered. Two ladies in particular were right across from us they looked like they had just finished a round of illegal drugs, alcohol, or both. Five minutes later I am told they don't have the special. Okay; I ordered something else. Another ten minutes goes by and I clearly see the chile relleno special heading over to the table behind me!! I am upset but quiet. ANOTHER TEN minutes goes by and the TWO LADIES in front of me who arrived AFTER us get their food!... BUT WAIT.. Not only do they get their food, but they get enough food to feed 3 families !!! After the waitress brings them 3 trips from the kitchen, they are already asking for togo plates to fill up. The entire time I have been calming my nerves watching the Sunday football game on the television mounted uncomfortably too high. If I was older, my neck would be hurt by this time. We receive our food. Not even five minutes later, the ladies turned off all of the televisions. There goes the game I was watching and actually enjoying... The waitress comes to the table and asks if we want anything else because the kitchen is closing in 5 minutes..!! It was not even 3pm their closing time that day yet and they are shutting everything down to get the hell out of there.. ..the waitress placed our ticket on the table and asked that we pay immediately before the registers close. We weren't even halfway through our meals!!! The ladies across from us did not get the same treatment, nor were they told of the kitchen closing nor were they asked to pay yet. We had our credit card ready on the table, and the waitress did not come by to receive payment; not for another 20 minutes!! Instead the waitresses were heard yelling with the cook possibly the owner in noticeably vulgar language. They had two separate yelling sessions involving all of the waitresses 56 of them. All this time we had no drink refills NOR were we offered any before we left. They finally came around for our payment after they had already turned off all of the kitchen area lights. There were still three other tables occupied at this point. I felt like I was targeted because of my race. I won't ever go near this restaurant and hope you don't either. Sincerely, Justin"

What we didn't know was that there was a day party going on at the lounge the same day. We encouraged the entire guest list to get line passes, and we bought a bundle of them ourselves. We arrived at around 7:30 pm as the day party was ending and got in with our line passes. We had spoken with an employee about potentially doing a VIP table and bottle service, and upon arrival found out that Saturday nights have a minimum purchase of 3 bottles at 250 per bottle. We weren't sure that we had enough people coming to make the deal worth it so we decided to sit outside and just drink at the bar. We had used about half of our line pass allotment when i was notified that some of my party were having issues getting in to the bar. They were told that only people with reservations or line passes were allowed in due to a party that started at 7. The Vertigo crew wanted to ensure that those who had reserved had room to enter and enjoy the club. Perfectly fine. we were able to use the rest of our pre purchased passes to get inFast forward to around 1130 pm when business has only slightly picked up. Mind you we were informed that the lounge usually is shoulder to shoulder packed by1030pm, and we are freely moving about because the place is pretty empty. The majority of my party were outside enjoying the night summer air when a few of us came in to grab a bite to eat no food out the outside deck. We have some food and a few drinks inside and attempt to go back on the outdoor roof space, there is a short line to stand in, as only so many people can be outside at one time. We wait patiently in line and finally when we're next at the door we watch a group of people come in the lounge area and assume we'll be let out next. No, a group of people who were not in line were let out next. We asked why and the door man said it was because they 'have a reservation'. Okay fine. This continues to happen and we start paying attention to where these people are coming from, some of them from the back of the same line we're in.  We are a respectable group of young professionals who just wanted to celebrate my birthday in a nice out door rooftop space, and maybe it was on us for assuming that entry to the lounge would mean that we'd get to respectfully enjoy all of the amenities. It is worth mentioning that there were about 12 people in my group, all of us blackthe only black folks in the whole place,and the staff for the night were white, i work in river north and while i wish i could say this was a first, it wasnt."

It is well located with free parking. The bar and restaurant menu have a wide selection of choices. The food is well prepared and generous in size. Restaurant service is good. Their beverage list is well matched with what they offer.They also have a spacious Gaming Room with slot machines. Unfortunately, I had a very bad experience with the service provided by a specific frontline employee at The Station. My machine ran out of coins. When that happens they automatically get notified and someone comes to refill etc. In this instance I waited for fifteen minutes and no one turned up. I thought maybe they were not aware of it so went to the main counter to tell them. But the staff there said that they knew, and someone will come to service the slot machine. I thanked them and went back to the machine I was playing. Five minutes later a staff, Tod, came to refill the machine. He immediately started telling me off in a most insulting manner in front of the other patrons who were there playing the machines fortunately, none of them stared at me or took any obvious interest in his tirade. He extremely rudely told me that I should just wait. I was so stunned by his nasty treatment of me and cannot recall what else he blasted at me. The whole encounter left me terrified and awfully upset that I was verbally assaulted for having done nothing wrong and became a victim of a highly unsatisfied employee. An employee who had indicated his dislike of me previously as well.That incidence left me wondering whether I was racially discriminated by Tod or whether he hates his job so much that he feels he can out rightly insult an innocent customer. Perhaps, he needs training in customer service or help with his anger management or guidance on how to curb his arrogance. It seems, Tod is not the only one who has issues. I was there on 5th June when the machine I was playing needed handpay. So, while waiting for someone to come with the money I went and played another machine. Previously, I had been told by a staff that if there are several machines free to play another machine while waiting for a staff; a practice I have seen many people at this place doing. The Gaming Room had probably only 6 people there and most of the machines were unoccupied. Wyatt, another employee, brought my money and I signed for the receipt of it. I mentioned to him that I will continue playing that machine once I take my money from the machine I went on while waiting for the service. He started telling me off loudly that I am not allowed to play two machines at the same time. In a harsh and authoritative manner, he told me to empty it now which I was doing to get back to my original machine. I told him I was doing so. But that was not enough for him and he stood there treating me like I had committed some crime. As he was leaving I said to him that I am not God to be playing two machines far apart  at the same time. I went back there since that incidence and noticed that now they have placed a Notice stating that one cannot play two machines at the same time. A Notice that was not there when my insult, discrimination and victimization happened. While there, I watched Tod come to refill a machine twice when the player was playing a second machine and said nothing to her. Exactly what I had done when Wyatt verbally attacked me.As a responsible senior citizen, these encounters at the Station left me deeply disappointed, aggrieved and terrified. All I can think of is that I have been racially discriminated by those two employees. They dont treat other people there like what they did to me. Very sad."

Read other reviews and visit at your peril,"The Deck has a great location, but I can not recommend it because of the owner, Mark. He was the only person there when we arrived, and he was clearly drunk or high or both. While we went swimming he decided, without our input, to prepare three burgers for the four of us. The three burgers and 3 beers and maybe an ice tea came to 88! But the worst part of our experience was his foul language replete with racial epithets. The four of us and especially the two women, were VERY uncomfortable and couldn't wait to leave. Afterward, we read reviews of this place on TripAdvisor. Wish we had read the many negative reviews beforehand. Do Not Visit this place! This was our only negative experience during our week on Eleuthera."

The place was built and designed very well. The owner Mark was very loud and obnoxious, but nothing bad enough to leave. He progressively got worse after doing shots and going behind the bar for a minute and coming out several times. After a long swim, around 1pm, we ordered another round of drinks big mistake, he became louder and starting cursing every other word, saying racial slurs mainly directed at jewish and african peoples, and insulting his own mother a lot. He had his drug dealer stop by to drop off some pot to him and he asked me to pay for the first round of drinks, which I did. He went on to show his scar from the car accident while exposing himself. At the end he billed us again for the first round and after I explained that we paid already, he became very combative and was not willing to listen. If you have to go here, go early when the owner is less high and drunk. It is a shame since it is a nice place but its not worth the stress on vacation."

The food is limited, but delicious and the Rum Punch alone is worth the effort. We visited the place twice during our stay due to these factors. On the other hand...the owner is a total mess. On our first visit he made inappropriate and racial comments, including offering to show photos of a recent car accident surgery! Our second visit was worse! The owner and the only wait staff there was drunk and hardly able to carry on a coherent conversation. He also shared a marijuana cigarette with another group on the patio. My girlfriend was mortified and at least one couple walked in and quickly turned around. If you're not easily offended this will be an interesting experience to try, but if not consider yourself warned..."

First impressions as I entered the bar area the pub looked nice and welcoming. Until we walked around the side of the bar where a few staff members were sat around on the top of the tables being racially abusive in their conversation. Not a good start. As I sat down and looked around the decor was old and grubby could do with a paint and a good clean. Also the table was sticky and the bowl with all the sauces was full of sticky ketchup and used sauce wrappers. Ordered food which came within the expected time, I ordered the mixed starters of mushrooms, onion rings and garlic bread which was nice. As a main I had the half chicken which was also very nice. My family member also enjoyed their food. The desserts were also nice. Overall I would come here again as I did enjoy the food. But think the staff need to tone down on the chatting esp when their conversations which can be offensive to others. And also give the place a good clean "

We sat down to receive 3 menus that had a VERY limited number of items but were all presented in English...another warning. We ordered our food reluctantly and ate our dinner. It was not as good as eating at the mall's food court We sat back after dinner and watched new patrons arrive and look through their menus...which were bigger and fuller than ours I wondered if their menu was only written in Chinese...and as I discussed this observation with my husband Caucasian, I the Asian went to pay and discuss this matter with the back desk/cashier. I helped myself to a menu that the other patrons had and I discovered that it was in both Chinese and English and there were at least 100 items on this menu that we never saw! I asked many times for the reason why we got the ""other"" menu only to be told that when ""they"" saw my husband, they assumed we couldn't read the proper menu. I asked them why wouldn't we be able to read the ENGLISH that was on the menu...they apologized and asked us to return. I answered back with a NEVER. It's too bad that they don't see the value in customer service. It's even worse that my children experienced this form of racism with their dinner. SHAME ON YOU, Ho Garden.

Food was nice, four of us had been enjoying ourselves until after desert. The waiter came with bill without being asked. After one minute, he came back with card machine without being asked again! No explanation, not a word being said, just standing next to our table. It was such a rude behavior. We understand Friday is busy night, however we started at 6:20, it was only 8:30 when we were forced to pay the bill. No customers were waiting for seats. Other tables who came before us were still there, how come we were treated this way This made me feel that somehow the waiter or manager particularly chose us because we are Chinese. Its racist. I am being regular customer of your restaurant, have been to different branches around Birmingham and Bromsgrove. This service definitely should not happen to your restaurant. We were really very angry being treated that way. And I still feel indignant when I am writing this. I have never experienced this kind of rude service in any restaurant. It is beyond even basic human politeness. Standing next to the table with card machine and make customers pay and leave What restaurant is this! What service is this ! Why we pay 120 and get this service  We ordered wine, no one poured the wine for us, fine, we not being fuss about this kind of bad service. Does Miller and Carter value customers this way How would I tell all my friends about your service Is it because you are not worrying about getting customers Your service sucks. I hope my letter would make Miller and Carter management realize a good restaurant should not only provide good food but also a comfortable service. For my experience, your staff need to be trained on how to treat customers with respect and basic politeness. Before we left the restaurant, we made a complaint to the duty manager Oliver. He did not give us a good response and did not ask the waiter to apologize to us. He offered to investigate. I hope he did mean it. "

I would hope they would in future employ their staff using a little less discriminatory basis and avoid the naked racial stereotyping."

The sheriff was there as well. I couldn't believe it! Not only that! As we were leaving  it had just got done raining. My Mom fell on Golden Corral property. So as my boyfriend came back in the building to get help with my 66 year old mother, the Asian manager was VERY VERY RUDE!!! She told my mother well it just got done raining that's why she fell. No remorse at all. First off the ground has several cracks that needs to be repaired also no rugs outside no caution signs.So when I question this Asian manager she came across very rude. Went got the police and said this. The black girl with the blonde hair make sure she doesn't come back in. But she swore up in down to the police inside that I made a racial remark towards her by calling her a Asian lady which she is. Never the less. We finally got a incident report. I called my mom a lawyer and hopefully we will be able to shut this place down. Every review in here that is bad, trust me its the truth. If you are from St.Louis, it's not unusually to see a American African with blonde hair. So the manager can hold off on the racial profile herself. Bottom line this place is a dump, there food is nasty. I had to go to the bathroom right when I got home. There bathroom is VERY NASTY. But what you expect when a Asian lady is the manager of this dump..Her home is probably in this shape! PEOPLE BE AWARE!!! Do not eat there unless you want to feel like you're not human!! I will be contacting the District Manager on this place!!"

Before I visited the restaurant, I was really excited because this was going to be my first tapas experience. However, the experience was HORRIBLE. The host talked with me with bad manners. He lied to me about my reservation by taking me to a highup table which I did NOT reserve. As I tried to ask him if I can move to a table, a normal table area, he told me there is no table left. I saw one empty table so I called him and he told me all customers who are sitting in that area left special notes when they made reservations. First, when I made my reservation, there is no section for customers to leave special notes. Second, it is such a lie that all the customers left the same special note. If they ALL made that special notes, then it is NOT special, it is called COMMON. Later on, after the conversation, I heard some word, which are very judgmental about my ethnicity. I would like to say, this is a RESTAURANT for the racial majority, because all customers of racial minorities are NOT treated with justice and fairness. I HIGHLY recommend everyone NOT to come here! Unless you are one of the KKK!"

I also hope that restaurant staff will see this and make sure it doesn't happen again.We are a group of 9 Chinese tourists. At first, a Chinese female staff helped us and explained that they only had 4 2person tables, if not we will have to wait. We agreed to wait and said that we would be okay with being split into 2 tables too. After 10 minutes, a table for 6 became available, but a male Caucasian staff gave it to a small group of Caucasian customers behind us in the queue. I approached him and asked why it wasn't given to us, and he said that he would only seat us when a 9people table is available. I then explained that I have told his colleague that we were happy to be seated separately, so he should have given us the table. He then said, ""I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU TOLD HER. I AM THE ONE IN CHARGE."" Finding it hard to believe, I repeated the question, and told him it should not be my responsibility to know that the staff who placed me in the queue was not the one in charge of allocating tables. They work together and should have communicated between themselves. He then repeated again that he didn't care what I told the other staff, and he would seat us where and when he liked since he was the one in charge. I asked to speak to the manager instead, and he said that he was in fact the manager. He did not once try to communicate with his colleague.We were utterly surprised how he not only ignored what us as customers has said, but also refused to acknowledge what his own colleague has arranged or said at all. It was not only rude, but also completely unreasonable. If a customer reserved a table through a member of his staff, would he say ""I don't care what you told her, I am the one in charge"", and ignore the reservation tooI would not want to think that the reason for such bizzarre attitude was racial discrimination, but it seems to be a more plausible reason. Afterall, both the female staff and I are small, Chinese females. Or, maybe he simply thinks that since so many customers come to the restaurant anyway, that he doesn't need to treat people with basic respect That being the manager, he was above all of us, customer or colleague, and could do whatever he likesI don't think anyone should have to deal with such a rude and unreasonable restaurant manager. Especially if you are Asian, do not visit this restaurant."

Every time I would go to visit the Keys, I would either stop on the way down or on my way home. So, since we were on our way back from Key West yesterday, a stop here was in order. My boyfriend has never been to the Keys and I was really excited to bring him here. He picked out an Alabama Jacks shirt to buy and then we sat at a small table right next to the bar and we could hear several conversations from other patrons. There was also a lady that was sitting at the bar doing, what looked like, paperwork for the restaurant. The first thing that my boyfriend heard was ""we don't serve Democrats here"". Which in turn turned into a conversation between several men at the bar talking about Obama and ""nggrs"" and guns and shooting them, something along those lines. Let me just say that I am not a fan of politics and my boyfriend is biracial, with roots in Jamaica. After this happens, an entirely different patron walked by us twice and stopped each time. The first time stated the same thing about the Republican/Democrat thing. The second time he stopped he said that he was a fixture there and 'made his rounds'. He then stated that he will talk to anyone there, ""...including that black lady over there."" pointing to a woman in the corner. At this point my boyfriend and I were so appalled that he just wanted to leave and felt extremely uncomfortable. I told him to go out to the car and I would deal with it. I had to really control my anger, so I got the attention of the server, whom was a very sweet girl. I told her what happened and funny enough, she already knew that there was tension in the air and knew exactly whom the people were before I even pointed them out. I told her that I would not support this place ever again. I only had a couple of bites of the food I had ordered and neither of us finished our drinks. The server told me I had to speak with the bartender. When I explained to him how disgusted I was, the lady that had been doing paperwork at the bar chimed in and without even making eye contact with me, confirmed that the men at the bar were saying racial slurs. So, why was this allowed to continue until all but one of these men actually left And the bartender making comments too Then he tried to tell me several times that ""this place is not like that"". I have been in the restaurant business for my entire life and never have I ever heard customers or employees speak about someone like this. If it were ever to happen at a bar I was bartending, I would've told those people to keep their opinions to themselves or they could leave. The best part is that as I was leaving, one of the men that was making comments, made a gesture at me, and the lady at the bar told the server to tell me that I could have the shirt for free...no words. We will never go back. Ever. For the record, this is the very first review I have ever written. Being in the business, I have a mass amount of patience and forgiveness, however, it would be next to impossible for any forgiveness here."

I arrived in Zante Friday the 30th August for two weeks and since then i have had three forms of verbal abuse and two acts of assault. I am not the type of person to cause trouble hence why I have always been respectful and empathetic to the staff when declining their invitation to eat at the restaurant as I'm aware that it is there job to get customers in.My original plan was to eat there on the day before I leave but all had changed at this point After my pattern of not going into the restaurant the staff starting become more and more rude towards me , if they said something to me that was rude I would ignore them and i I even ignored the fact that they had called me the n word . On Friday 6th September when I had walked past the restaurant and the two members of staff have targeted me and threw stones at me with force leaving a bruise on my Leg and when I challenged them about it I was shouted at by the sleezy looking gentlemen and they had pushed me also at this point I will admit I lost my cool but it was justified. I had taken this further to the manager and nothing was done.I am strong believer in the staff representing the image of what kind of business this restaurant is and going by what the absolute disrespect I was shown I believe the company is based on racism and sexism as I was always respectful and was treated appallingly by staff. I feel that this abuse was discrimination against my race and my gender being a black woman and due to calm nature they felt it was okey for their frustrations to be taken out on me when other British tourist was extremely rude to the two men.I would never pull the race card towards anyone unless I was sure it was racial abuse but I had heard that this was not the first time the staff had acted like this and many girls had received perverse comments from the two awful men.I would avoid this restaurant and I suggest you take a walk to Nikos cocktails where the food is delicious and the staff are lovely they have wifi and don't pester you if you wish not to go in. Other restaurants I recommend which are Cicero , Robin Hood , noodle box , staff treat you like family and are so kind to you no matter who you are "

Their sweets are great and the service is generally good. However, this was my first time visiting the Laval location, and never have I ever experienced such a horrible encounter with a business in my life. There was a line when we arrived, which was not a problem for us although I didn't understand why as there seemed to be plenty of tables free. We waited in line for about 1520mins and during our wait I noticed people just leaving after speaking to the guy seating people. Coincidentally the two groups in the line that left were of Arab and the other what to me seemed of Indian background more on that later. I didn't think much of it at the time, nor the idea of anything to do with race crossed my mind as personally I've never had an encounter of racial discrimination with a business.So our turn comes and I tell the guy that we are a group of six. He replied saying ohh I'm not sure we have a table for you at the moment you guys are a large group, it will be a long wait for you guys. Mind you every other group infront of us aside from the two that left were seated as soon as their turn in the line came up. So I told him that I can see from here multiple tables free outside, some that are even beside each other so you can easily connect two tables. He replied saying that the manager has clearly instructed them not to move tables even if they are beside each other. I asked him if we can be seated inside instead as it was almost empty. He replied saying they didn't have staff to wait the tables inside. At this point I started to get frustrated as he seemed to have an excuse for anything that means us not getting a table. So I asked to speak to his manager, which he replied that he had left. Of course that was a complete lie as I find it hard to believe that a restaurant of that size is left with no person in charge on Saturday Night at 7:00pm. So I told him that we'll wait for that table outside then, but he kept replying with i don't know when we'll be able to get you that table. Meanwhile multiple other groups got seated as soon as their turn in the line came up with varying group sizes, while we sat there waiting. That was until another group of middleeastern people got their turn and they were also given a response of that they'd have to wait and then they ended up leaving. Right then is where I felt something is nor right, so I went up again asking him that at least 6 more groups have been seated while we were waiting and I find it hard to believe that our table for SIX still can't be arranged. He replied saying he didn't have a table yet and he still doesn't know when we'll be able to get our table.At this point we just decided to leave as I was just so disgusted by the racial discrimination that this staff was showing us. It was so upsetting to all of us that it ruined everyone's night, and not because we couldn't dine at a place that we were excited to go to, but at the treatment we received at this institution. And judging from a few other reviews of this place now that I read them, it seems this is not a one time occurrence."

Never in my life have I been more humiliated and embarrassed or left with a sour taste in my mouth then when I did when I ventured out and came to visit this bar in Huntington Beach. My friend who is of Caucasian race was sexually harassed by a fellow white male she did everything she could to stay away from him the bar did not give to cares about what was going on even after being reported. my friend kept complaining about the strong weed smell that he carried as well which ended up making her sick. when we were in the bathroom other women witnessed the sexual harassment that my friend indured. However because I am of brownskinned my friends and I were kicked out of the bar because she became ill and accidentally vomited all on the floor due to the man who sexually harassed her stink. I explained to the manager the situation I had vomit on me trying to take care of my friend because she complained about the man who physically touched her breasts and the rest of her body and no one did anything about it after she complained I then had to endure more racial profiling when a another white man walked up to my white friend and asked her if she was safe and okay because a person of color in Huntington Beach was unbecoming no one stood up for me and protected me after the fact that I was there to take care of my friend and make sure she made it home safely and made sure that she was safe and okay I will never recommend this bar to anybody of color especially when I am a brown skin I was seen as a threat after explaining to the manager what happened and getting upset .however being racially profile because I am of deeper skin kicked out of a bar because of my skin tone is unacceptable and uninviting I would never recommend this nar to anybody and I hope they get shut down due to the fact that they don't assist women who are sexually harassed they don't assist the people of brown skin but rather resolve their issues by kicking out the people who they find a threat to their location this bar needs to be shut down and nonexistent for the horrible customer service and racial profiling. They cause on people. they resolve the issues by saying they will take care of the situation but kick you out. I gave them a thorough description of the man who sexually harassed my friend who touch her breasts and her vagina however we were the ones who were kicked out because they were with the person of colored skin and be because they did not give a crap. this is a bar that should not be in operation for any case when women complain about being sexually harassed you need to do something about that person not the women as victims of the harassment being kicked out not the person of a color skin being kicked out because they got very upset.this very unprofessional very racist and unacceptable I am very disgusted with this bar for my first time ever in Orange county I come from a family of financial value and education however to be discriminated against and racially profiled because I am a darkskinned is very offensive and unacceptable never did I receive an apologies never did I get my money back I never had the opportunity to even get my credit card back this is a crap run bar

To the waiter that served us, we are sorry about refusing the mandatory 18 tip, it truly was not your fault; this was a true sign of poor management. Please contact me and I will pay you. This truly was not about the price of the rice. We hope that you wake up and realize that racial profiling is not acceptable."

We are a racial integrated couple i am black she is white we have been together for 25 years. When we walked in people started staring at us. I did not care because we are use to it. We ordered our food to go and i went outside while my wife went to the bathroom. I had a bad cold so i brought a drink mixed with orange mango and honey in a glass from home. So i went to our car and grabbed my drink and i went out to enjoy the carvings they had which was very neat, they depicted the early western days especially the stage coach. I was minding my own business not talking to anybody and completely sober.When i finished my drink from home my throat still hurt so i was going to walk to the store which was only a hundred yards away.Then my wife come running out saying are you drinking beer i said NO.Then the bartender came out that i never saw before and not been at her bar accused me of drinking beer. I had nothing in my hand and i told her that it was juice from home,then she said she has to take my glass. That is when i started to get mad first of all i was not drinking beer and second that is my personal property, and thirdly i was guilty from the time i walked in for being Black. I am tired of Being RACIAL PROFILED this how people of color get shot for nothing.I am a 47 year old man that has raised a beautiful family and i am a pillar to my community.Remember Black lives Matter BOYCOTT THE RUSTY WAGON"

Horrible!,"If I could rate 0/5 stars, I would! I stopped by this place with my significant other and friend from the US on the way back to Kingston.. little did we know we were in for a nightmare. We pulled up to the spot and I guess dickie came out and greeted us. We asked if it was a cook shop and he ignored the question and urged us to come inside. After being rushed down a flight of rather steep stairs, he seated us at a table and insisted that I sit opposite the two men in my party.Dickie was very odd. Firstly, he thought we were tourists because of our complexion and uptown accents and asked us where we were from. He also wouldnt stop twanging. He also kept ignoring the fact that we requested a menu.. not knowing a single thing about this secret spot. After some time he finally said that there is no menu but we can eat whatever we liked. We asked if there was chicken, goat, seafood etc. he said yes and it is a five course meal. At this point we were itching to leave because we were looking for a cook shop and not a dine in restaurant. Seeing the uncertainty on our faces he nudged me forcefully and demanded that I take a picture of the table he set up for us.... feeling pressured I snapped the photo attached to this review...We then asked the price and he said 35 USD per head. We shook our heads and said no thanks, ready to leave. He instead asked us how much money we had and how much we would be willing to give him.Outraged, we politely said no thanks. But he insisted and scurried off into the kitchen to do god knows what. After much deliberation we finally got up and decided to leave. Trying to be polite we told him that we were going to leave and he stormed toward us cursing and getting on bad. He stood in front of us cussing and tried to make me go into the kitchen to see the fruit he began to prepare for me specifically. I declined and rushed out the door which had been locked earlier by a little boy lingering the shack. He told us that we could not leave but we kept on moving. Dickie used multiple expletives and RACIAL SLURS towards us, flung his hands and body at us.. he even stated how much he hates people from Kingston! He hates people who look like us which I guess is fair skinned, curly haired, young adults. He continued on with the racial slurs and fwords until we were out of his sight. This so called restaurant is indeed best kept A secret! No one should ever go here. This place should be closed down due to the multiple bad experiences locals and tourists have had here. It is filthy, feels unsanitary, unstable, uncertain and for sure a secret. Absolutely awful."

Firstly, upon arrival... you are blown away by the magical sea views. Then you get Bob the carguard, who magically makes a plan for parking. Amazing cocktails, and its tough to choose, so many yummy choices. The food is straight from the heavens itself. Takes a while to prepare but definitely worth the wait. The staff.... 10 star, they manage to get everything done and work like magic especially over the busiest season. They are kind, prompt and funny..Management is welcoming, and honestly do their utmost best to hep everyone out. Especially when you haven't made a booking. I applaud their hard work. I read a review on racism... and quite frankly, from what I experienced... Racism is an unknown thing at The Sandbar. They treat EVERY customer, whether you are black, white, pink, orange or blue the same. Its 2018 peeps, let get over the racial pointing fingers.Thanks again for the great time. Looking forward to being back there... And I promise to make a booking next time.."

A couple of seconds later, a group of white folks walked in without a booking and the waiter said he would "" make a plan"" for them.

The food is fresh and the menu is varied. My favorite is the Country Benedict. The portions are plentiful and the biscuit and gravy reminds me of my Southern roots. You can even get fresh fruit as a side, usually an extra charge at IHOP. I may never go back to IHOP again. This place is just that good.Really sad to hear the review regarding poor service and the idiotic racial reference, but the review did not even mention the quality of the food, just all of the stupid waitress drama. This matter could have been effectively and better handled on the very first time by summoning the taller male manager, who is very approachable and personable. I would suspect that this is not a racial issue, just a crummy server issue. FYI: apparently it is a requirement that the manager come around to each table and asks point blank if everything is alright. I witnessed this at both the Palm Springs and Oceanside location. Frankly why in hell would ANYONE sit at the same table with the same lame waitress 3 different times and expect a different outcome The server's ineptitude has been demonstrated three different times to her dissatisfaction according the reviewer. The very definition of crazy...doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome.Bottom line, the food is great, the prices reasonable, and the service, with one possible 3rd party exception noted is excellent."

The staff was professional and very attentive. We decided to return to have another weekend lunch and we were seated in the bar area which is not a very nice place to sit for lunch. We were seated by the hostess who was very nice . We were told that the bartender will be taking our order and drink requests. We waited over 15 minutes before our drink request was received. After we ate a salad our steak arrived and still no refill on her iced tea. The bartender was too busy talking to a certain patron which was spewing racial comments all over the bar. Soon after I requested our check which took another 15 minutes because the bartender was too busy talking to the disruptive patron. Several patrons were very disturbed by the racial slurs being tossed about. Nobody came by to try to quiet the patron or have him removed. If I have anything else to say it's don't let them seat you in the bar area very uncomfortable and not the type of experience I would recommend for anybody.

He came back with the water and asked had she had a chance to look over the menu yet while making eye contact with her, and walked away without asking me. when he came back, he asked her had she decided while only making eye contact with her, she gave him her order and was ready to walk away before I barked out mine, literally. after the food was brought out, he came over and asked her how was her salad while making eye contact with here, and proceeded to walk away. once he brought the check out, he placed it in front of her and walked away. Did I mention I'm an African American Woman. I called the restaurant to speak with the manager about the situation, while he expressed his apologies, he told me my call was pointless because I would expose the restaurant for the unlawful racial discrimination.

I was two minutes early to pick up my order but I gave the cashier my name and phone number. She took another customer so by the time she was done I asked her if my order was ready. She looked around and couldn't find it so I waited a bit more. Then I told her my order has been longer than 20 min so is it free as per Pizza Pizza's policy. She ignored me at first and took other customers even though I was there before them. I asked again if my order was ready and she finally gave it to me and told me it was free. The guy who makes the pizza told her it's not free, he said that I gave the cashier wrong information even though I did not. He immediately took the pizza and told the cashier I had to pay and to take other customers before me. I called Pizza Pizza's customer service right away but they did not answer the phone. My husband came in and asked the cashier what is going on. She finally gave me my order but not before the pizza guy shouted out racial slurs to me. I asked him politely, what did you just call me He said I was a fg chinaman, and said it twice. I couldn't believe my ears because first of all, I am a woman, and secondly, he is also a racial minority. I have lived in Canada for over 50 years and never in my life has anyone ever called me something like that. I am proud to be Canadian and respect all types of cultures. I am shocked that this gentleman who works at 8601 Warden can talk to customers with such foul language. I know this is an isolated incident because I have frequented this store many many times in the past. I just hope other customers will never be subjected to this type of treatment. I believe respect goes both ways and this guy has a lot to learn if he plans on living in Canada or represent Pizza Pizza"

We called back to say that we wanted a new one, or our money back, and they argued that it was impossible for the ginger beef not to taste good.I offered to drive the stuff back to the restaurant, and when I did, the cashier and the guy son, i think began being belligerent, and then grabbed me physically with dirty dishwashing gloves and tried to force me into the kitchen to show me how to make ginger beef. I simply asked again for fresh food, or my money back, and the owner came out and began swearing at me that his food is always fresh, and that I do not know Chinese food. When I said that I am an executive chef, and I understood what the dish was supposed to taste like, the owner became adamant that I didn't know Chinese food because ginger beef is WHITE MAN food. After this, the owner and the other employees began with the racial slurrs regarding white people and chinese people, with the son getting so angry his mother or someone had to hold him back from coming after me.This is not a place that I recommend to anyone, especially those with a family that do not need to have racial slurrs screamed at them in a place of business. In the end, all I wanted was to be satisfied with the purchase of an expensive chinese food dish, without being threatened physically, and without the racist comments."

I ordered the whole boilded shrimp poboy as my entre, and had the fresh sauted vegtables as a side. My mother had the french onion soup to start and ordered half of the fried shrimp poboy for her entre. My younger brother had the fried oyster poboy and the two shared a large basket of sweet potato fries for a side. Both of them enjoyed their food and said the sweet potato fries were excellent. Our server Lisa was very helpful and attentive to our needs as well as knowledgeable about their products. The atmosphere of the dinning room reminded me of a country summer lodge, and the bar had a traditionalLSU/College town atmosphere. Could definitely see the Baton Rouge ""good ole boy"" crowd hanging around here regularly! It's unfortunate to read about some of the racial issuses people have experienced at this place, being a biracial male myself as well as a Baton Rouge native I sympathise with most minorities in the area. However, my family and I were treated very well today without any hints towards an open bias or prejudice. If some of the things I read are true I hope that this issue will be addresed by either the owner or GM in the near future. This is 2013, open your eyes to any blatant or subtle hints of racial discrimination happening in your establishment. The only thing I personally thought was off about this restaurant was the fact that it has an al la carte menu, which is completely fine, however, the food was presented all together as opposed to in courses. For an Al la carte restuarnt lets try to at least get some time for customers to enjoy their courses before the entre is presented. That being said, my overall expirence at Jones Creek Cafe was a positive one and I will be back to try out their chargrilled oysters and beverage selection some time soon!"

Moments after he had punched another customer. The bouncers are extremely violent here. I do not recommend ever coming here. Your night will be completely ruined. I am looking into filling a complaint against this bar. Please boycott, my friend now has a swollen and bruised face, he cannot open his eye thanks to the bouncer who was twice his size.

The waitress, Cassie, took it personal saying she assumed I wanted the appetizer with the meal. I had asked for a medium cooked steak but instead received one that was rare on the inside and looked expired. Cassie, never came back to check on how the food was. I requested a discount, was offered 10, but settled for more only to be robbed by getting change back from 25.00 instead of the 30.00 given. Finally Cassie offered the patrons at the next table extended happy hour while offering me nothing but loud passive aggressive racial insults based only on my tan skin. Getting out appetizers, checking on the quality of food, and returning proper change was Cassie's responsibility as a waitress. She was unwilling or unable to do her job, took business personal, rubbed it in that I got poor service while other patrons got extra favors, and in her mind and in the minds of the other patrons attempted to blame me for the poor service I got and the good service she was willing to give to the next table by loudly saying, ""It was black!"" Horrible experience due to this horrible person, and she can make it racial but at the end of the day it's her and her horrible attitude.

After sometime, we noticed that the people who came after us were already served and had their second plate while our appetizers were not even given to us. So we took the attention of the waitress and she told us she will follow up. But after a total of an hour and a half waiting, we stood up, left our table and went down to tell the waiter who took our orders that we can't wait any longer. Guess what he answered in an arrogant tone, ""This is not a fast food, and your orders are all fresh and must take longer time."" So, I said "" I can't understand how a crab salad for our table could take an hour and a half while the same salad was served to a table next to ours who came for costumers who came after we arrived and orders were taken far after than ours were taken!"" No apologies were given to us. Only arrogance and a strong feeling of discrimination. We are residents of Padova for almost ten years. My daughters are both good students and I am a good taxpayer, hard working migrant. We know we were the only Asians in that restaurant but that is the first time, in all our lives dining in different local restaurants, we felt underestimated. To the owner and waiters of La Scala Restaurant Abano Terme, racial discrimination is not being applauded now a days. You are a shame and a disgust to all local restaurants in Padova. Shame on you!"
Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg187895d8861527r559113477DonFefeFlorenceTuscany.html,Date of visit: December 2017, Don Fefe ,Europe,Italy,Tuscany,"Auckland, New Zealand",Our worst experience in any restaurant ever  We were not served and finally left hungry without eating,"I have hesitated writing this review as I dislike writing bad reviews on any place of work. In the event I decided to write an honest account of our experience in the hope that the management of this restaurant takes this criticism on board and sorts out the issues raised. We visited Florence for 10 nights over December 17January 18 as part of a four week tour of Italy and decided to stay in an apartment hotel complex adjoining this restaurant. The restaurant is located in residential area La Farina Road and is no doubt frequented mainly by the Italians locals who live around the area. There are few high end restaurants in the area and those there are, are located some distance away. The food we understand from word of mouth is excellent. We wouldn't know since we weren't served... and therein lies the problem. We had just traveled by train from Milan and had checked into an apartment hotel adjoining the restaurant. We stopped by earlier to ask if the restaurant was open and was told that they would be open later .. we did not make a reservation nor did they appear to think it was necessary at the time. We eventually wandered in by about 7.25 pm. on that day. We were greeted by a rather nice duty seating manager who told us that the restaurant was full but that she could serve us a quick supper at one of the reserved tables if we agreed to vacate it within the hour by 8.30 pm latest. We were tired and hungry and saw no problem with this. That is when our troubles began. The manager showed us to a basement seating area where a table was empty. It was now 7.30 pm. We had an hour to go. The waiter on duty over there decided he was not going to allow this. He refused to let us be seated until the manager insisted. Then began perhaps the surliest encounters with any waiter in any restaurant I have visited over the last 66 years of my life. The waiter poured supposedly a welcome drink Prosecco literally a drop 1 cm in a champagne glass and dropped the menus that were entirely in Italian on the table. We tried asking for an English menu but he just ignored us. We immediately decided to order something fast so that we could finish and vacate the table as promised but to no avail. The waiter didn't bother to come to the table for another 15 minutes despite our best efforts to attract his attention saying he was busy .. we tried telling him we were pressed for time .. finally he came to the table 7.45 pm when we started asking him what we might order from the Italian menu he went and brought an English menu dropped it on the table and then walked off and refused to deal with us for a further 20 minutes .. we waited until 8.00 pm kept asking him to take the order since we had to vacate as agreed and he kept telling us he was busy .. eventually at 8.05 pm we gave up as there was no way we could have ordered our meal, waited for it to be cooked and then finish eating it in the time allotted to us, which I suspect was his intention all along. We finally left the restaurant and since there was no where else to eat we went back to the apartment hotel hungry. I am appalled and absolutely shocked that a recalcitrant waiter in a restaurant can choose to serve or not serve a customer in this restaurant. This must be a first of kind. The manager who seated us was a friendly person and seemed to understand our plight and did try and find a solution that was perfect in every way but one ... Apparently the waiter did not like it it. We are as yet unsure as what seems to have upset him. Perhaps it was because:a We were not Italian the restaurant appears to cater to the locals from what we could make out and he couldn't be bothered b that he decided he was not going to serve a customer who was nonEuropean difficult to believe in Italy; orc that he did not want to serve the customer that management appears to have unfairly thrust on him on a busy night.Frankly we don't think the issue was racial. When we entered the restaurant we were treated very well by the seating manager who found us a good solution. The problem then was a waiter who had little patience for nonItalians usually English speaking I presume and possibly because the restaurant is located away from the tourist areas. This is something management needs to address. What ever be the reason for this rather disgraceful behavior the owner managers need to address how they communicate to their staff how and why they wish to seat their customers. If there are labor or employment issues they need to be addressed later. Making a paying customer bear the brunt of the anger of an employment dispute is not a very stellar reputation for a restaurant that otherwise prides itself on the quality of the dining experience it offers. To send a customer away hungry from your restaurant in an area where there are few eating areas or hotels if at all because of a disagreement with your staff is not the reputation one wants. Notwithstanding I'd like to thank the seating manager who did try to find a solution that unfortunately did not work. It wasn't for want of effort on her part. My wife and I thank her for that."

What I witnessed today from fellow employees was absolutely disgraceful behavior towards our party of 13 people. I am in the industry as a Chef who happens to be deaf, I witnessed racial bias towards the group, because they were African Americans and I saw the most despicable gestures of ignorance, eye rolling and unprofessional glancing, whenever someone needed something the vibe we felt as if our table was a bothersome. First off our server Rebecca was awesome and is to be excused from this situation. But other fellow employees who gave our party the cold shoulder should be reprimanded and have sensitivity training for racial bias. I was absolutely mortified with this whole scenario. That being said we felt the food was tarnished in a way that when it came to the salads and portions of the meals that this was also impacted by today's experience. The salads portions were completely ridiculous and ingredients were missing and salads weren't dressed accordingly. When it came to getting water not one staff member on the floor brought water to the table to replenish. That was one thing I observed with the other tables that they were getting full plated salads and their entrees. When it came to dessert time as our server mentioned that if you need more dippers we will refill, well one of the members at the table asked a fellow employee about getting more dippers, she was very rude about it and it took a manager to get the job done. With this negative experience this evening and observing and witnessing the ignorance of the establishment's lack of respect towards minorities. If your establishment is going to have a problem with minorities and race, then shame on all of you! This was absolutely unacceptable! Management should make this right by addressing and fixing this serious problem. I was so upset by this that my mother and I left and we both felt for what we paid for it outrageous. Please Advise!"

Went there at 7.15 pm but wanted to try our luck anyway. After 5 minutes of wandering around on our own, we went to the bar and told them we had a reservation. We were told to walk around by ourselves to look for our names on reserved tables. We thought that was odd, but did it anyway. We had been treated well in Germany so far and they seemed busy, so gave them benefit of the doubt. We couldnt find our names on reserved tables but saw available tables, so asked a waitress to help. I tried to show her my email which said that I had a reservation which she didnt bother to look at. She just gestured to a table with 2 persons already seated ie she wanted us to share a table when there were available tables with no names, and told us rudely to sit there. I said we had a reservation and she said two persons, so sit. We left promptly. We were treated badly and demeaned, not sure if its a racial issue we are Asian. I read that this place is an institution and has been around for a long time. Maybe thats why the attitudes of wait staff are in dire need of an update. "

Food was overpriced and bland.,"In all my life I have never witnessed racism the way I did in Botin. I don't look Asian so it didn't happen to me, but I noticed that all Asians that entered this restaurant were all segregated into one small unpleasant area. Really, Botin Racial segregation in 2018 One Asian pair who were probably Asian Americans, were insisting that they reserved months ago, and were so appalled they stood up and didn't finish their food. In all my life, I never witnessed racial segregation until now. I made sure to take a video of all Asians segregated. If I could post it here, I would. Let's talk about the food. OVERPRICED, bland and extremely overrated. Take a look at the photo. Botin is NOT what Spain is about and does a bad job representing such a beautiful and inclusive country. SHAME."

Never have I ever felt more uncomfortable in my life. I am still in shock. We sat inside the premise due to the fact that the terrace area would of been too cold for us. The restaurant owner, Mauro, seemed arrogant and rude for reasons we could not understand. Let me explain, I ate the salmon carpacio which was STILL frozen! My husband had thglioni fiziosi pasta with scampi and salmon which was also cold after waiting for over an hour. We started to get uncomfortable by the way the owner was inappropriately touching his female staff members who were clearly uncomfortable... Finally, we spoke to the owner, Mauro, to express our grief in the politest way possible. We conversed in Italian due to the fact that I had taken Italian courses for over 15 years and I am quite fluent in the language. When we spoke, he made various racial slurs at us which progressed to him constantly attacking our ethnicity. When we told him we didn't want any problems... He then proceeded to laugh at my husbands oxygen mask which he uses post lung cancer surgery. This review goes beyond just restaurant etiquette  there was clearly a lack of human decency. My husband, who has battled cancer for years now, was completely broken. On lookers witnessed this exchange and proceeded to leave, they came up to us and extended their sympathy vouching to never go back to the establishment. We understand that some people lack self constraint, we hope that the staff of Mauro's will learn from this experience and better themselves as we have learned that some people are inexplicitly and unapologetically cruel. What an absolute horror."

Without hyperbole, this was one of the worst experiences I have ever had trying to dine out.The inside of the place reminds me of something you'd see in Brooklyn. This is why I took a sick friend to see it. Besides my love of tea, this is not my sort of place.After we sat down, I noticed some children with oranges to which I have a grave allergy the next table over. I tried to warn the woman in whose care the children seemed to be. She ignored me.After 5 minutes of trying to get the woman's attention, my friend  a blonde, blueeyed fashion model  said ""excuse me"" in a low voice and got the woman's attention. She told her that I had a food allergy at which point the woman became immediately billigerent. At this point, I should mention that I am a black American writer and translator who has lived in Paris for some years now. Since the children had started to eat the oranges and I started to react, I warned the woman and my friend that I had an epipen in my bag. She told me that she was going to call the police and the fire department and have me taken away. All the while, I am trying to control an oncoming attack.""I don't know how people do things where you're from, but here you don't just walk into a restaurant and tell the OWNER what to do. This is MY RESTAURANT."" At this point, it was lost on me that there might be a racial component when she threatened to call the police not to aide me, but to threaten me to leave. And I would have left, but I had to make certain that I could stand.The emphasis is not mine. Her two employees were cringing behind the food prep station and the customers looked visibly uncomfortable. Moreover, she kept screaming ""this is MY RESTAURANT.""She threw the check at me it hit my companion and refused to accept my card, even though it met the minimum as stated on the menu. As I had no cash, my friend paid. He hands were shaking.I asked her to please step away from me and told her that I felt assaulted. She said: ""No, I feel like you're ASSAULTING ME."" And I responded, ""But you are the one walking towards me"" as I made my way towards the door. My friend got between us and as we were leaving she told me she thought the woman was going to hit me.I have lived in Paris for years and for all the stereotypes about French customer service, I have never been treated like this. Not once did the owner to anything to help, but took every chance to intimidate and harass. Mind you, though the place wasn't full, there were seated customers. Her employees watched with horrified looks on their faces. One young server tried to bring me water but was repelled by her employer.When I said that I would review her establishment on YELP, she threatened to call the police again. Mind you, at this point I had been to lightheaded to even stand.The woman I am referring to was darkhaired and heavy set in a way that you don't often see in France, much less Paris. If she's there, you'll know and I would recommend giving her a wide berth.My girlfriend is a Polish human rights worker and thought I should have called the police as the owners was certainly against EU antidiscrimination statutes, but I didn't want to bother. I just wanted to warn people that the place is owned and operated by a callous and irrationally aggressive person and there are so many other places in Buttes aux Cailles that are more worth your time."

We visited Maastricht as a family party of 6 from UK to see Andre Rieu in concert. It was a truly wonderful experience, Maastricht and the Dutch people are warm and welcoming... with exception to the proprietor of Ut Lieuwke.My family and I searched for a lovely Dutch restaurant to celebrate our weekend and stumbled upon this establishment prior to the concert. We were initially delighted with the welcome from the two charming young Dutch waitresses sisters who invited us to a good table; the owner behind the bar was a completely different story!!!!She refused to even consider one of my party amending a set meal menu, switching one course for a more expensive choice that we would pay for... after much huffing and puffing with great annoyance, she relented. She then proceeded to insult us, stating British people drink too much, you want to order more wine!!!! We passed this off as a joke at first thinking that some UK like a drink, but so does the rest of the world.. we said no thanks, no wine, but some water.... she still maintained the wine comment; persisting with a terrible racial stereotype that wasn't called for. Uncalled for and rude!!!!Moving into the evening, my mother aged 70 was physically manhandled out of the toilet by this manager; who insisted to know ""THIS TOILET IS FOR PAYING GUESTS ONLY!!! Holding her arm and physically moving her. My mum was quite shocked and told her where she was sat, where the Manager had been racially aggressive to my family.... then my mother was frogmarched back to her seat!!! DISGUSTING BEHAVIOUR AND COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE!!! The food was delicious and can't be faulted in anyway, but the Manager needed special attention. The two waitresses were charming and displayed exemplary customer service... Thankfully it didn't ruin our evening at the concert; but after spending nearly 275 on a meal for six people, you expect to be treated at least with some respect. Thank you. "

We called the waiter and complained with no apology he just took the pizza and said he can put it back in the oven. That was it!!! I got up, complained to the manager and we paid for the single pizza and left. The waiter/server wore two black earrings he was male.

They barely speak English, so we communicate through online translation and afterwards they ask a server, who can speak much better English to translate for them. Such a shame. I am not sure if there was a miscommunication, but We had asked my sisters Japanese speaking friend to reserve us a table and my sister told me we got a reservation for 7 pm. So, I arrived at 7 pm sharp, only to be told through online translation that we needed to come back half an hour later. My sister arrived about 5 minutes later and told me her friend had said 7ish, so we had all assumed its a little more than 7 or at least closer to 7 pm. Maybe, its too hard for the hostess to just make up her mind and say 7.30, instead of 7ish and confuse us, or maybe 7ish to her means 7.30. Very funny!!! We then decided to just accept the 7.30 time, because its just a mere 30 mins anyway, buttt another problem arises. There was a waiting area with a bench at the restaurant and it was empty, but the hostesses still insisted we needed to go out into the cold about 6 degrees celcius that night and come back later. I had two kids with me as well as my 71 year old Dad. I really wonder the reason they put the bench there if they do not want anyone to wait. Besides, by the time we finished clarifying about out reservation time, there was only about 15 minutes left. They told us it was because they had other guests. It was as if I was struck by lightning when I heard those words. Did that mean other guests can sit and wait, while we couldnt It really started sounding so racial to me. Only after I said wed leave if another guest arrived, that the hostesses decided to stop arguing. Despite all these, we really enjoyed the food and kept reordering more beef."

Sat down outside and he asked us what would we like to drink, we asked for beers but wasn't given a choice and with the food he recommended something which was some rip off Italian something , was just basically cheese on toast with a small sausage , bacon and a sun dried tomato. He brought us the beers which were Leffe with Leffe glasses, first of all the glasses were hot, secondly that day was quite hot so you should really expect restaurant to serve cold beers , no the bottle of beers were hot. Thirdly I asked him to change the glasses to some cold one, what does he do Goes inside, gets a single piece of ice cube, brings it out and starts spinning it in front of us Is this waiter ok Fourth he didn't offer us menus so it was recommendation that wanted us to have no choices was given.

I would not write if it was just that I went to a restaurant and had a worst food in my life. Believe me. Just don't go there. It definitely was not worth it."

On the evening of September 28, we went there to have dinner together with my friends. When I booked my seat on the 26th, I stressed that we had four people and needed two people and two people to pay separately. The waiter told us it was all right. When ordering the meal, Abby Mi Junling, the waiter, told us that we could not separate the checklist with two club Marriott cards. We asked why not She told us that it was a restaurant rule. Then she split us into two tables which are the smallest in the restaurant. We told her that we ordered too many dishes, and this little table could not be placed at all. Then she went to consult Jerry Renjian, the manager of the Chinese restaurant, and when she came back, she became even more embarrassed. She said: We will change your dishes into small plates."" However, a guest which next me, she was sitting in a fourperson table but only ordered one dishnoodles. After we parted, I ordered four main dishes and a roast duck at one of the tables, but they were all arranged on the smallest table of two, far apart, which made our friends very embarrassed.We asked her to call the manager over to explain the situation, but the manager's service attitude was even worse. We waited for more than 10 minutes, got up twice and went to the manager. Then the manager came. His attitude was the worst of all the people I met in Marriott.The manager was so rude, he talked to us loudly for ten minutes in front of all the customers and kept on saying that he couldn't understand what we were saying We are Chinese, so that all the customers looked up and I didn't want to think about it again. It wasn't until the new guests were all around us that he felt it was inappropriate for us to change to a private room, but he never explained why a table bill couldn't be paid separately. Until we finished eating and checked out, they did not explain the situation or apologize.Marriott is an international company, but let me be disappointed that foreigners can pay the bill separately, but we can not, is this racial discrimination Has the quality of your manager fallen so far in the face of other customers and in the face of loud and noisy customersMy demand is to ask your company to improve the quality of service, to confirm that a single table can be AA system, a table can be separately settled their bills, this is the international practice, please treat each customer equally. If only the customer questioned, to achieve customer demand, is your company's service to rely on a row, can make it out Such services are not the services that an international enterprise should have."

But sometimes, you just have to write about your experience and on this occasion, Ive never left a restaurant more disgusted. Recently on a trip to Luxembourg with friends, I paid a visit to this new restaurant that had opened up since Id been there last. It was late and my friend and I went in for some food. We ordered two drinks and I ordered the sushi platter and she ordered some chicken noodle dish. After a little wait, she suggested we just take it as a takeaway. So I requested the order to be wrapped up for takeaway and paid for everything. Then after a long wait, close to an hour, we questioned how long will it take The waiter apologized and said, sorry we had a busy day. Its going to take a while. Then another waiter got involved and said Typical whining Irish, always complaining. I really dont think we were in anyway unreasonable in questioning where our food was and this racial slur should never be shouted at a paying customer in a restaurant with other customers listening. I was absolutely outraged and appalled and on future visits to Luxembourg, will never be going back there. Ive never posted a review about a restaurant and not commented on the food before, so that says it all."

When paying he charged extra for a salad and asked him to correct it and he said that we took 3 plates from salad bar. After arguing back and forth he said the owner saw you taking it so basically we were lying for 10 francs. Never experienced such racial discrimination as he did not bother when we entered the restaurant as did not offer us plates for pizza and we had to get up get side plates.I would really not recommend this place to anyone even though food is good but there is no sense of customer service .

After an appalling experience, earlier this year in May 2018, this establishment is blacklisted in my books.What was meant to be a joyous birthday celebration with lifelong friends, turned out to be one of the most humiliating experiences ever. Its sad, yet true that racial profiling still exists within London, despite our city being recognised as one of the most multicultural cities in the world.It was horrific to witness our group of friends being subjected to intense scrutiny from the security and management team at Madison, which included our friend being segregated from us at the entrance for extra identification checks despite the fact that our booking was a late afternoon brunch.Several other guests were permitted into the venue during the late afternoon, without being subjected to aggressive security and identification checks. Furthermore, I was surprised to see a member of management escorting our friend to our table, having informed her dining at the venue is being timed, and that it was imperative that she eat and leave on time. What is even more shocking is that the manager was lingering around throughout our entire meal, literally timing us.In all our years of dining at an array of establishments ranging from Michelin star to local restaurant joints, we have never been treated with such prejudice, so much so that we had to console our friend who was reduced to tears after being treated in such a disgusting manner.We did complain to security and a floor staff member, however no apology was given. We examined how nonblack customers were being treated by security and venue staff, and it was clear that the management and other staff members were perturbed by our presence.We live in a day and age where we must not let such prejudice go unspoken of.I shall not recommend this shambolic establishment to any of my family members, friends or clients.Madison may have a certificate of excellence for great food, yet they lack greatly in customer/human relations."

And this was when the circus started! ""Nobody else had had a problem with this""  ""noone else had commented on this"" and the kitchen staff were too stressed to have a moment to register this feedback.When someone did eventually come to the table to discuss the complaint, it was dismissed as totally wrong! Gradually, curious and apparantly totally bored Swiss guests sitting around our table, had nothing better to do than listen in to the meantime pointless discussion. We are not Swiss.Very quickly 5 tables around started assuring us that everything was perfect and how dare we criticise this restaurant and this cuisine. We became quickly victims of mobbing and I promise I am not exaggerating. This was very very unpleasant behaviour. At no point in my life have I been so discriminated against. This was simply racial behaviour by narrow minded Swiss citizens.We had to leave the restaurant rapidly.Very unpleasant.How unfortunate when constructive criticism isn't understood. "

I asked to talk with the owner but it was her. She might had served me finally but I was afraid to get spoiled dishes. I decided to leave.By the way I was businesscode dressed after a day of meetings.Im in germany 3 to 4 times a year and believe than German waiters wouldnt act that way, this new comer from Vietnam thought that I might run away without paying based on my face.This was truly HUMILIATING especially that no one react to this injustice  like it could happen 80 years before at the same place .Truly my worst ever experience in any restaurant!!!!!"

A lady in black im assuming to be the manager refused to give thr kebab even after i told her one of her staff kept the receipt. Told her id bring my Dad so perhaps they could identify him. Brought my Dad from the table and explained to her again. And this is where i aost lost my sht. She looked at one of her colleagues and said I dont trust him out loud and i actually heard it. And you could tell she was coming from a racial perspective yes you can tell these things after being through many episodes such as this in Singapore. I confronted her saying did you just say you dont trust me and she had no reply to that but gave the I couldnt care less look. At this point i was flipping mad. It had ruined my overall experience at USS. But i resisted escalating the issue as my entire family was around. My poor Dad had to try and explain himself all over again and it didnt help that the stupid lady had mixed up all the receipts and we had to say our order to the specific details in order to prove that we bought it. She embarrassed us in front of those in line and basically convinced me USS has gone to the gutters because of substandard staff like her at the Oasis Spice Cafe. OASIS Spice Cafe needs to relook at its own policies when dealing with customers. This was something i could never expect at a place like USS. OASIS Spice Cafe has reached alltime lows and I wish that particular staff of yours nothing but the worst in her profession  and you should see to it that she does not for me, but for the others whowoild visit your establishment."

I am a darkskinned black female and have always treated very well here. I've also had long and pleasant conversations with both owners and feel very comfortable here. We will definitely return. I also noticed that one waitress is Asian although the restaurant supposedly does not like Asians. Lunch is also very nice here as well as sitting on the summer terrace.

The restaurant is tastefully decorated in a modern Mediterranean style. The menu oozes exciting choices of European and Asian cuisine. We tried a couple of pizzas, one with duck, and the other bacon. Both exceeded our expectations, and the crusts were the thinnest and crispiest you will experience anywhere in Ulaanbaatar. The Chef, I am told, hails from Malaysia, which explains the delicately flavor of hoisin infused in duck dishes. Other members of our part tried the steak, which was tender and cooked to perfection. The garlic bread was unlike any other I have tried, and was served with a mild relish reminiscent of sambal from southeast Asia. The selection of wines impressed us, and we enjoyed a bottle of 2011 Chardonnay from the Vasse Felix cellars of the Australian southwest. It was not cheap, but complemented our meals perfectly. Do try the deserts. Each is different, and full of surprises. Our favorite was the parfait with seabuckthorn compote. The serving staff are attentive and friendly without being intrusive.We were all impressed with this restaurant on our first visit. The interesting yet mild flavors achieved will be well received by the Mongolians who are not generally lovers of strongtasting cuisine. I predict that the Rock Salt will be well frequented by the good folk of Ulaanbaatar.

You are paying for a unique experience. Unique costs a little more. With that, you hope the the food, drink and particularly the service do not leave you disappointed. I wasnt disappointed. Although busy I was seated quickly on the balcony by a friendly young lady who was followed in short order by my waiter. Who in turn was extremely friendly.The menu is simple and I ordered the Vegetarian salad and a glass of wine. No complaints about the food, well presented, fresh and flavoursome. The food really is secondary, you are so sucked into people watching, either those seated around you or the multi racial throngs walking around below with the facade of the Louvre as a back drop.If you can afford 2030 for lunch and you are visiting this part of Paris this is a must stop."

At first, we thought the service was slow because that's how it is sometimes, especially at a busy restaurant in a sleepy resort town in France. Also, it seemed like there were only 2 people the owner and his wife, perhaps serving the customers. That was all fine until we realized that the other patrons were being served much more attentively and politely, whereas we had to try multiple times to attract their attention to ask for anything, including to order our food. A few minutes after we ordered, we wanted to add a side salad. Too late  the waiter had already walked away and studiously ignored our attempts to get his attention. I had to hurriedly say that we wanted salad to the waiter as he walked by our table, because he couldn't be bothered to stop while we were trying to flag him down. He stared at me as if I was an alien but otherwise did not acknowledge my request. The exact same thing happened when I tried to ask for the bill after the meal. Side note: he definitely understood my bad French because we eventually got the salad and the bill. Interestingly enough, our party was the only nonwhite group at the restaurant. We shared scallop brochettes, a pizza, moules frites and the salad, which miraculously came. To be fair, the scallops were cooked pretty well, but that was about the only positive thing I can say about the food. The pizza was greasy and unmemorable, the moules frites were also mediocre and lacked flavor and I have a pretty bland palate and the salad was just a plate of arugula with some balsamic dressing. All in all, pretty average food that is not worth seeking out. Save your money and your stomach space for somewhere with less racist attitude. Oh well, at least we had a great view of the sunset."

The food was ok this time, but the service was diabolical. An hour an a half between the first main and last main coming out. My wife had to take our youngest back to the apartment as it got so late. One of the dishes was burnt and they firstly tried to excuse this by saying this is how the Greeks like it. Right.....ok but we aren't Greek. Bit of a sweeping statement to make. However they sent out another more edible plate. When I asked if they would take some money on the bill less than 5 euro per head as the service had been very slow etc. They point blank refused, and after I stuck to my guns and said I don't think we have received full service and the timing was shambolic, the waitress spoke with her father who is the owner and we were then told they would call the police if we did not pay. At no point did we say we weren't going to pay. She again made the statement about the Greeks liking service this way etc to which I replied that is a very bad statement to make considering you work in a tourist filled area, I felt insulted. At this point a lot of the staff gathered round, maybe if they all did their jobs the service would be better! Who knows. But anyway, won't be back here.

What a terrible disappointment. We were completely ignored while other customers around us noticeably all White were being served  even those who had arrived after we have. After a while and noticing that we were being ignored, my wife had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. Then, after another while and still being ignored, I had to go there to ask if a waiter would please come to take our order. The order was taken and then the real waiting started. About 40 minutes later the coffee finally arrived, in filthy cups with dark coffee stains running down the sides  as if the cups had not been cleaned properly. And still no cake... until we could bear it no longer and decided to leave. We were quite obviously being ignored while all of the White customers around us were being served  even those who had arrived after we have.

It mystifies me why someone with such disregard and disrespect for the community around her would choose to live and do business in Mexico. I recognize that sadly she represents some of what Americans are, but I do not believe she represents who we want to be.

I felt compelled to expose the flat out FALSE accusations of these so called ""classy ladies"" its ridiculous that they are pulling the race card when their tale of events is nothing more than liars. I was actually there that night having dinner with a friend and we were seated right in front of their table, they were already seated when we arrived and everything seemed normal, a bit loud but its a restaurant/bar, no biggie. As the evening continued they got louder and louder, and with in a little bit these girls were drunk and being so annoying and obnoxious that my friend and I were talking about it. We even made a gesture at the waitress after noticing how poorly they were treating one specific waitress and I was surprised by the composure that the waitress kept, staying pleasant, at this point if I were her I would have just ignored the table or told them to beat it. They acting like a bunch of 8 year olds. I did see the manager come talk to them but I didn't hear the conversation, I think it was at that point they got their booze cut off, which was probably in the best interest for the staff, the other patrons and themselves because they were making fools of themselves. I was glad when they were cut off because frankly some people just don't know how to behave and drinking only makes it worse. The waitress finished up serving them and gave them their bill in an undeserving nice and professional way. Those ""classy gals"" left and the servers began to clear the table and then two came back said some things to them and then slapped a class of wine to spill all over the table and said ""whoops! sorry hahaha"" and ran off ... again like a bunch of 8 yr old children, the servers looked at each other and shrugged it off but NEVER said anything back, and I NEVER heard the manager yell at them any racist remarks, or anything at that matter. At this point I was paying close attention to the situation because it was so ridiculous how they were behaving and I could barely hear the conversation he had with them so the fact that they claim he yelled at them is a flat out lie. This had nothing to do with race and everything to do with stupidity, some people simply don't know how to behave when they drink and the fact that they make this about race is ridiculous, I'm ethnic too, I always get great service when I go there, they only difference is I am not an idiot. If these girls believe in their accusations I would love for them to pursue legal action, fortunately I paid with my credit card, I have my receipt, showing what table and when I paid to prove I was there and I will gladly testify on what actually happened, and I am sure my friend will too. The servers deserve at least that much specially after they handled the situation so professionally. And to those ""classy ladies"" grow up, figure it out, this reflects so poorly on you and your community."

And a defense to ""racism"" story","This place is amazing! Great food, great prices, and great service. I've been there a few times and I decided this was a great time to give these guys a positive review considering, as evidenced by the commenter below, the amount of bad press this story is getting on Facebook.I've always seen a mixed crowd at this joint and have gone there myself with friends who are also IndoCanadian. I have never seen any remote indication of any racism whatsoever towards IndoCanadian crowds or any other ethnicity for that matter, so I can't really see them choosing all of a sudden to be racist toward IndoCanadians, but I suppose this is TECHNICALLY a possibility. I find it difficult to believe that the story that is being told really happened as it is being claimed; that it came out of the blue and was essentially completely unprovoked. So, after seeing this place start to garner a bad rep, I felt the need to chime in. There was an article posted in the local newspaper about the ""Racism"" story, and after some digging I found someone who gave a secondhand account for the other side of the story. Check it out, and make your own judgments. This is verbatim from a Reddit user, who, really, is just as credible if you think about it:""My friend works at the charles bar and he told me what happened. Apparently these girls made a reservation for a ufc night when the bar is packed but they didnt make the reservation big enough. They then began to take stools from the bar and chairs from other tables to try and seat everyone and management told them to stop. So they began to sit at the tables that were reserved for other people. After management told them numerous times to move one girl apparently said 'make us' and the manager kicked them out. Then on the way out one girl threw her wine on a bar back and another poured a drink on the debit machine while screaming insults at the manager. So the manager pointed in the direction of surrey and said it was that way. None of the employees can comment on it because the company has ordered them not to.""I can't vouch for either side, really, but I thought it would only be fair to present the other side of the story in defense of this great place."

Food looked good. we waited for just over 5 minutes, then another table right next to us was seated, and the waiter visited them first, and right away. Brought them the complimentary bread, had a chat with them. I was so offended. Don't assume because I'm white that I won't appreciate your food, your culture, or your atmosphere. The table served before us was all Indian. As I complained to my husband to make sure I had seen us be snubbed, the guy at the bar listened to our whole conversation, and just smiled knowingly. Give me a break!"

Don't waste your time and money here.","My wife and I lived very close to Steveston Village, and one day we just decided to try this restaurant out. We were there at around 6pm and was seated promptly, and that was the end of the good experience. After we sat down, there were a few Caucasian families and couples that came in after us. And we were the only Asian couple sitting in the restaurant of about 67 tables. The waitress promptly attended to them and offered them water to drink while also holding short conversations with them. While my wife and I sat there, with no water, one menu and ZERO attention even though we were the first to sit down. We waited for at least 10 minutes, and if you were purely waiting for 10 minutes, it feels like a decade and I finally got impatient, and started to raise my hand to get some attention so that someone could take our order.Finally someone was looking my way! While the waitress was approaching our direction, I was starting to speak, but she just walked pass us without saying a thing, and started to take the order of  guess who  a Caucasian couple sitting behind us. At this point I was pissed off, I had the urge of standing up saying really LOUDLY, ""Really! This place is a JOKE!"" and just stormed out of the restaurant with my wife. But obviously my wife stopped me from elevating my emotions in this situation. I mean, if the waitress had just acknowledged me, and said something in the sense of ""Sorry, I will be right with you, I saw them call me over first."" or whatever I would've been fine with it, even though I was already annoyed by the poor service no water, no attention, long wait to order. After a few minutes, finally she walked over to us, of her own accord, without me having to raise my hand again, which means she did see me raising my hand the first time which pissed me off again, and took our order without apologizing for what happened and how rude she was. KariHouse is suppose to produce SouthEast Asian  Singaporean, Malaysian  cuisine, but the food that came out of the kitchen feels like someone just took a few recipes off of the internet and cooked it the first time. We ordered Laksa, Prawn Noodles and Char Dua Pan Stir Fried Rich noodles , all of the dishes had basically no taste to it, they have no idea what they are doing... It was just bland and dull, it almost felt like they withheld the salt too. SouthEast Asian cuisine uses a lot of spices and herbs in their food, which Kari House seemed to lack. I lived in Singapore for roughly 5 years about 20 years ago. Loved the food there, ate out almost everyday. The food that they are serving in KariHouse are basically the same street hawker food they have in Singapore, but KariHouse cannot even hold a candle to to the street hawker food's quality and tastiness. If you compare this restaurant Kari House to ANY Singaporean street hawker on a scale of 1 to 10, Kari House would be a 4 and Singaporean Street Hawkers would 89. Verdict: Terrible service that almost felt like racism I do not understand, the owners and waitress are Asian too , mediocre to poor food... Don't waste your time and money here."

Alright, our bad for showing up near closing their takeout menu claims the closing is 11pm, but the manager later claimed it was ""outdated"" and actually 10pm after a long road trip and trying to get our fill of 11.95 pasta for the night.After a long, 30 minute wait I'll cut them some slack for being near closing time they bring out our orders and the initial bowls of spaghetti with either meat sauce or meat sauce and cheese. We chow down, food at this point is standard fare. It's not terrible by any means but by far the best experience of the night.We ordered four bowls, and after getting three bowls the server turns to us and informs us that they're out of spaghetti. Nothing else, no offer to reimburse us for part of it or even a sorry for this ""minor"" inconvenience. I asked to speak with the manager and as soon as I leave the server a grown woman turns to my group of 1217 year old kids and asks ""what's that guy's problem"" Red flag 1 for poor service.I speak to the manager, and politely inform him about how we only received one bowl, and that each of us could have eaten at least an extra bowl. Therefore, I offer to pay half for each of the bowls and full menu price for everything else we ordered and received. He immediately dismisses me and says ""no."" Not even an explanation or a sorry, just ""no.""After finally getting our 4th bowl of spaghetti, I start trying to track down the manager and get a proper response. I reexplain the situation and all he does is try to cut me off with ""so you're paying full price,"" ""no deal,"" and other such phrases. He threatens to call the police on us, but he doesn't actually do so when we call his bluff and tell him ""sure, call the police."" He tries telling us he'll comp one bowl and that's it. I insist on comping two bowls and he finally acquiesces. But not before saying that ""we always get problems with Asian customers, something about not wanting to pay."" Completely unacceptable restaurant service, and frankly something that is unacceptable anywhere. He charges us the 50 off and tells us to get out and never come back again.If you're stopping by the area, go to the local McDonald's instead of this 1950'sesque retro American diner complete with the atmosphere of 1950's racism."

So we walked to the mall where it is located but got there right at 3:00 pm and was told they would be closed until 5:30. We were inside a huge mall so no problem, really! We ended up going to see a movie and then stopped back by at which point we saw wedding decorations out front. I went to the entryway and asked if this was a private party which I was assuming but...I was told,"" yes."" Nothing more. So, we went on our way. The next day was the same closed at 5:00 but there were several shops I wanted to look in so we stayed around for an hour or so. We walked into the restaurant and the Asian lady, who had a snarl on her face looked at us and said, ""menu there,"" pointing to a plastic covered menu on a stand in what I assumed was Chinese and then English in very small and lightly colored print. We stood and stood and finally was able to ask for a table. They took us into the dining room that was filled with Asian folks, put us in the back corner at a card table with which I was unable to sit at comfortably because the table was turned so as not to let legs fit under the table. We were given paper napkins while others had cloth napkins. Hot jasmine tea was placed on our table as well as rice bowls, small plates, and chop sticks. We were then given an official menu and waited for 1015 minutes to place our orders. We ordered rack of lamb with sweet and spicy sauce, house fried rice, and hot  sour soup with two iced teassimple I admit but rack of lamb isn't everyday nothing where I am from!. We were never offered water. The soup came and was delicious. It had chunks of seafood, tofu, mushroom, bamboo shoots, and sprouts Very tasty! They then brought a plate of what looked like meat to us. I had never seen lamb this way but...ok. Rice came and looked really good so we began. The lamb was what I personally would put in a stock pot with veggies and spices to create a hot and sour soup. It was fatty and did not have much meat at all. My husband ate it but he likes fatI do not and it was way more fat than meat. The sauce was not spiced at all. It was bland and not good. The rice was good although needed soy sauce for the salty flavor. No soy, chili sauce or even mustard if we are going stereo typical! Very disappointing. They did have homemade cookies to end the meal but I will not return. They never asked us if we needed refills on our drinks and there was a lady going around the room with iced tea in a pitcher and hot tea is a staple in an Asian restaurant! They were not comfortable with us spending our money there so I won't be comfortable returning. Especially when we visited an Asian Restaurant the day before, where we were the only Caucasians in the place, and were made to feel comfortable by the sweetest girls and had a delicious dinner! Fortune House gets a thumbs down!"

After having a glass of ice spilled across my lap I asked for a replacement. 10 minutes later I received just a glass with a big lipstick mark on it rather than ice. Our meal was thrown down in front of us, the waitress didn't ask if we wanted any condiments. After our meal we advised the Manager of the poor service we had received and he told us ""It is because she is Italian"". When we didn't tip the Manager's courteous manner quickly changed and he just walked away after taking payment. I took up the issues with Wildwood head office and was offered a small amount of compensation for the poor service we received but nothing for the casual racism that was displayed in front of my 7 year old son and 11 year old daughter. After discussing the issue with the regional manger it quickly became clear that the whole organisation has a lack of understanding of these issues. The regional manager even asked me what nationality the Manager was, he then asked if he was British I couldn't answer this question as I didn't really think about he race or nationality. The fact that this question was asked in the first instance just adds fuel to the fire."

We apologised for our mistake, were told our table had been given away but asked if there were any others available. I assume the manager, agreed to seat us but turned to my friend of Asian origin and said In England, we call to say we will be late. My friend explained that he was in fact from England and got a retort of well you should know better. We were astounded by the blatant racism in this city where differences are embraced. We were offered no apology as we left. We will not be returning."

Whilst my white friend and my wife of another race ordered at the bar the barman served my white friend first, and then ignored my wife despite it being an empty bar. He told her to stand to the side when other white guests came and only served her once other guests protested. And then didn't bring her order despite taking our money.My wife only told me about the service after we left the venue as she did not want to cause a scene. I can not believe that the person behind the bar could act in such an overtly racist manner to guest. We were absolutely appalled, especially as this a beautiful part of the U.K. which many tourist want to come to. We've never met this behavior anywhere in the U.K. If this venue is ok employing such people I would thoroughly recommend never going there."

This is something we rarely do as we find most of the local restaurants somewhat mediocre, two exceptions being Chez Tonton and Ci Vediamo Li, both in New Barnet. Do go to them if you have the chance.However, I had had a nice lunch with my friend at The Haven over the summer so we decided to give it a go.The restaurant, which is very large indeed, was full up. Unfortunately, this made it somewhat difficult to hear what my husband was saying. At first, we had a very efficient, professional waiter who helped us with our choices. All the staff were very busy and did not seem to be solely allocated to an individual table so over the course of the evening, we were served by other members of staff.My goats cheese salad was very nice, as were my husbands prawns though he thought the plum sauce was somewhat gloopy and certainly not made from fresh.Our aperif drinks were also very nice but when my Rioja came, it was like slight sour and fruity dishwater. Not good.My husband found his pasta main too salty but otherwise somewhat flat tastewise. My ribeye steak was mediocre. The texture was quite succulent but this belied a rather bland taste. My husband had cheese instead of pudding and the selection and quality were pretty good. My pudding was fine but how much can go wrong with Mvenpick icecreamThus far, we both thought that this was an example of yet another mediocre Whetstone restaurant but this one is more pricey.During the latter half of our meal, we were served by a seemingly amenable waiter who had an accent. My husband is notoriously bad at distinguishing accents and asked the waiter if he was Israeli. He told us that he was Turkish but that he understood why my husband had said that because there were so many Israelis in this area and indeed in this country. To my knowledge, this country only has a small Israeli population. I asked him whether he meant Jews or Israeli as Barnet has a disproportionately large percentage of Jewish people. He told me that it was the same thing and the impression he had in the 8 months he has been in England is that the Jews own the country. He encouraged us to agree with his point of view until my husband pointed out that we are two of those Jews. When my husband told the manager what the waiter had said, he told us, Everyone has their opinion but he shouldnt have said it. Either the Manager is an extreme liberal who believes that freedom of speech trumps all, or he was of the same opinion. To be honest, if someone is going to think racist thoughts about a group of people to whom I belong, I would rather know. But ideally I would prefer not to be served by a racist. Full stop. We wont be going back."

Once we left the restaurant I looked back and could see that she was having a full blown conversation with her male collegeue.So I ask myself, what was the REAL reason for not being seated or served at this restaurant.1 We were dressed appropriately.2 The restaurant was virtually empty at the time of entry after 6pm.3 Servers were standing around doing nothing.4 The bar area was empty.If customers are not entitled to drink within these premises at the bar, then they should not be any chairs at the bar. This for me was a blatant form of direct racism based on the colour of our skin. If we could not afford to pay for our alcoholic beverages then we would not have entered these premises. Being born and raised in the UK since the 70's I have had my fair share of direct racism within eating establishments.This, for us, was unacceptable customer service and people should not be prejudged on their appearance,i.e their ethnic make up in which we were. We are both black educated professionals who earn a fair sum and live a comfortable life. I think that your establishment needs to take a leaf out of Starbucks NEW training manual on ethnicity and diversity training.Certain businesses have regulatory bodies and ombudsmen that discrimination complaints can be taken to and I intend to do this as this GOT TO ME TODAY."

They actually do not want you there. I went in just to buy chicken and wedges. The guy told me to go to the shop down the road instead. I said to him are you kicking me out of your shop And he said ""I don't know"". I then decided to rise up to him and decided to buy something from the shop restaurant, because I just don't give in to racism really. I bought two pieces of chicken combo. I didn't even get the right peace, one peace was like a fillet. I saw one guy coming from the back I swear he did something with the chicken. All I can say is I am surprised this kind of behaviour is still happening. Someone literally kicks you out of their shop because of the way you are. This guy had never met me I wasn't rude to him he had no right to act the way he did. I just lost 5."

The waiter said yes and would get to it. We could see the waiter was rather busy so I went to order the food and asked the colleague who took our order if they could get the chance to clean in seeing as she wasn't as busy and said ofcourse. However she came with the food table still dirty with others peoples food and drink still there and she tried to just give us our food without clearing it. My mother asked kindly could you please not place it down without cleaning it. She then tried shoving the food at my mother and said you either want it or you dont. At that point i intervened and said could please just clean the table and make space so we could pleas eat as every table was like this or was taken and she reluctantly took the food away and muttered the ""N"" word under her breath.

I used to come here a lot before but hadn't been in a while, there was only one member of staff visible at the front. The poor guy was making all the food as well as taking the orders and being a waitor at the same time. I had three lamb sheesh kebabs in naan and he made the naan perfect and crispy just as I had asked, the kebabs were very small and didn't like how many raw onions were on the plate. In reply to the person who said he experienced racism here from Asian youth, all I will say is that every race has its idiots and there are plenty of places that a coloured person can eat at in this country where white people not only show their discomfort at having to share the same space as coloured people , but will also swear at times. Racism is definitely a 2 way street and works both ways."

However, racism comes in many guises and the obnoxious young Asian that walked in and looked twice at seeing a white face in the shop couldn't have made his displeasure more obvious. He stared, pushed, abused and generally provoked me. I'd like to say the other customers and the shop staff told him to behave but in reality they ignored his aggressive behaviour. Pity, because the food was good and I would have returned but while I wouldn't think of him as anything other than an unrepresentative young loudmouth whatever his colour or race, I'm not putting myself into potential danger anywhere."

For people who claim to experience racism from here and make absurd remarks about facing discrimination just because there is a mosque nearby and it gives them an excuse to promote islamaphobia is ridiculous to be frank.

Being non English myself and in the the company of my Mauritian former partner and daughter. I contacted Todac by message for further information. I have no doubt he is a Doctor as he says and he and his wife are ""well dressed"" . But after a number of messages and prompts, I was non the wiser to his claims. So into the breech . I arrived at an extremely busy pub full of Sunday and Christmas dinners along with many drinkers merry on their football teams top of the table win. We were seated comfortably within 23 mins of arrival. Our food joined us within 15 mins of ordering. As I hate waste, my only grievance is the very large portions. The seasonal nut roast and yorkie pud it was served in are bigger than my four year olds face. We measured two types of potatoes, three veg, but can anyone actually eat 14 sprouts. My daughter was dwarfed at the crowded bar, but still managed to order her ice cream pudding with the extremely busy but attentive staff. As we gave mum a wee break and played tag in the narrow beer garden , I was delighted at the graciousness of other customers as we stampeaded. Customers of all ages, creeds denominations and genders. Chatting randomly to randoms It didn't take me long to realise that this is quite possibly the most wellcome and inclusive establishment ANYWHERE. NO XENOPHOBIA,NO HOMAPHOBIA and with strong leadership of a predominately female team, looks like the patriarchy is being challenged too. I could not fault anything so I turned to the Christmas crackers, they too spilled forth with quality gifts and jokes. No ! Racism is not alive here , not even hiding behind it's usual ""liberal mask"" ., this place is a quality all round cracker."

Two of the party immediately picked up on it and said nothing. ""I can't take your order just now because we're busy""! No apology, offer of drinks, or bread for the table. Interesting tone used! We had to ask a different waitress for some table bread. Not impressed so far but keeping calm and observing.Order eventually taken and food arrived. Scallops as starter, quite well done and reasonably tasty good presentation but a little cool. Chicken liver parfait was flavourless and lacked seasoning not by a little bit either.Haggis dish lukewarm; the most bland insipid haggis I've ever encountered I'm no stranger to haggis.

As soon as we got to the front of queue I was told by the bouncer that my friends and I were not allowed into the club as we were too drunk. Which was a clear lie as we had not had anything to drink at this point. They then proceeded to let everyone else in queue into the nightclub even though they were incredibly drunk. So we waited another few minutes to see if they would change their mind. As we were waiting we noticed another group of British young men attempt to enter the club and they were also denied entry. I then approached the bouncer and asked him were we not allowed into the club because of our nationality, to which his response was some horrible language and he pushed me away from the nightclub. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone unless they want terrible service, verbal abuse and racism."

The manager wanted to give a beating after we filmed the event and his humiliating treatment. The food is not fresh. When we said that we did not want to change the dish and they took money because we were afraid they would attack us Do not recommend getting there and there are many good restaurants and a better human attitude. We encourage you to be careful instead

He and I went up to the bar together to order. I signalled for my mate to order and the bar tender repeatedly said, ""speak up, I can't hear you."" He could hear him perfectly well. After a couple of repeats of this my mate was practically yelling, in clear English, and eventually the bar tender dismissed him and turned to me to place my order. I don't believe the bar tender realised we were together. He effectively refused to take my friend's order.I ordered successfully, speaking English, without yelling. The only difference I can see is that I'm a white guy and my mate is Malaysian. Intellectually I'm aware of this type of racism, but when I experience it first hand it makes me sick to the stomach. It deserves to be called out."

I'd like to think it was a nice gesture and not something negative, although that was the impression we got. The new waitress was very kind and she did speak and explained patiently everything she was asked. :La Capriata offers a regular menu and a glutenfree menu upon request, prices being slightly higher on the last 25 differences to menu with. The glutenfree melanzane Parmigiana were exquisite, the best we had tried so far! GF tortellini a ragu Bolognese were also delicious, with the 30 month old Parmesan on top. As for the joker desert, which was brought with a lighten candle, included: almond cake, chocolate cake, panna cotta and a pistachio freddo. The hidden costs were on slices of bread gluten, gluten free, when noticed only on check that we had to pay 4 and 2 each. Not a pleasant surprise to find out in the end something isn't really on the house but not mentioned otherwise when served without being ordered on purpose. I'm only giving a midlevel rating on service part because the bread was served by the first waiter, and the new waitress was really nice and she might've not known the previous guy didn't mention we'd pay for it."

All the tables were being served promptly, while I had to ask at least 6 times for the order. The beer came after 20 minutes, when I was half way through the starters, and despite calling the waitress loads of attitude several times, there was no response. The European customers were being attended to, quite promptly. The beer they served, was not the local variety and when asked why, they said they were out of stock which is not true. The waitress came with the bread basket next, with exactly 2 very hard midget sized buns. Mind you, I am paying the same 2Euro cover charge. And no, they did not replace the cloth on the table before the meal was served as was being done with EU customers. The meat was well done, the antipasti was OK too. Fairly large spread. I must say, the meat was tasty. I was told they would accept credit cards, but when I was about to pay, I was forced to pay in cash while several customers paid via Card. Mine was a VISA.

","We, a family of 4 adults and 3 children with partly indigenous Swiss roots, and partly Chinese background experienced the rudest ""service"" in this restaurant. We spent a lovely day in the surroundings of Lugano. The kids were exhausted and hungry from exploring and walking around. The five year old kid was already sleeping and therefore his mom was carrying the little boy. I was hurrying ahead of the group to avoid a detour on the way finding an open restaurant at around 5pm on a Sunday. When I arrived at the Olimpia, the outside area of the restaurant was occupied by around 70. I told a waitress that we are 7 persons and that we want eat something. Then, I was heading back to make sure nobody gets lost. In the meantime the mother of the five year old took the shoes off the little one and put the sleeping kid on the sofa outside the restaurant. One of the waitress told the two mothers that this is not possible. They asked for menu card to order something, but they waitress told them in a very unfriendly manner that it is only possible to eat at the table. When I was back with the rest of the family, I asked her if the boy can sleep on the sofa, while we are eating at the table in a distance of 5 meters. She told us this is not possible either. Now, I told her that I want talk with her manager. The answer was, the manager is not here, therefore she is in charge and we should leave the now. She wished us a good day in a very dismissive way.We went over to the Pizzeria Tango across the square. Where we received an excellent service, delicious food and spent 159 CHF which could be in the books of the Olimpia owner if his or her employees would have shown more flexibility and customer friendliness.As a Swiss, I am ashamed. This happens just a week after the ""Tschligate"" debacle with Oprah Winfrey in Zurich. Was it racism against foreigners, arrogance, missing business sense or just two overstrained waitressesOur advise: Go to Restorante E Pizzeria Tango 100 meters across the Piazza Riforma and you will receive a family friendlier service see our review."

Upon arrival we were 'greeted', rather rudely, by the manager and were told to take a seat. We weren't sure why he was laughing at us at first as we all spoke fluent french to him. However, after hearing him speaking in Italian to the other staff it was clear that he was making fun of us because we were anglophones. When he came back to take our order he asked us where we were from two Australians and an American, after which he went into the kitchen and said that 'they're all American' and continued speaking about us in Italian we understand a little Italian and could pick up that it was racist, When were finished he came back and said 'you done' in a way that really meant 'get out'. So we paid and left and on the way out he made one more 'Americano' joke. The food was overpriced and I seriously resent paying for racist service. The ironic part was that he was Italian and we could actually speak better french than him. I would never go back here."

So after waiting some time, another customer walked in. And the lady behind the counter continued taking their order instead of my moms. My mother is not caucasian, and it absolutely broke her heart. She couldn't believe she could and was receiving such treatment in The Netherlands. Generally a very liberal and accepting country. And to have her receive some form of racism just saddens me.

I saw that there were excellent reviews on tripadviser, so we gave it a shot. My husband ordered the classic Dutch steak with onions and mushrooms wick comes with a side of fries. I ordered the mussels with fries. The steak was juicy and well cooked but the mushroom onion reduction was overly salty. My mussels were pretty good, barely any sand I might add. So a thumbs up for that. The kitchen was right in front of our table so we were able to see all the action from their one chef. I could see him preparing our dishes and the smells made my mouth water. As the waitress brought pour my husband's plate another table behind us caught the waitress' attention and ordered another thing of fries. Our waitress went to talk to the chef and she came out with my mussels and dropped off MY fries at the other table. I was confused and upset since those were clearly my fries that I ordered before the table behind me. I am pregnant and had been craving for fries the whole day today and was hoping to get some crispy hot fries...the waitress apologized and offered me a side salad instead. She explained that they were all sold out of potatoes for the day. My darling husband gave me his fries instead but I couldn't shake the feeling that the reason my fries went to the table behind me was because we're Asian and the other table were Caucasian. This soured my dining experience and needless to say, I won't be returning to this establishment. "

The food and the service are beyond belief.I give praise where it is due, but sadly there is nothing to praise about this place!We were sat near a group of 4 Indian customers and were shocked at the blatant racism shown toward them by the waiter. Now the manner he spoke to us was poor, but the way he spoke to them was disgusting! If this was to happen in the UK, there would be action taken against the waiter for racism.Our food was just about edible, had no flavour and the portions, well you could argue that we were lucky they were so small!We were made to feel uncomfortable by the waiter when he seemed to take pleasure in telling us they do not accept cards. Funnily we witnessed what we assumed to be a local, was paraded next door, and allowed to pay with a card!This however was refused to us...It's their choice whether to accept cards, but they should clearly advertise the fact that they don't..... For someWe were truly disgusted and my wife asked to speak to the manager, but was told there was no management on the site.... Even though we'd seen a gentleman that was clearly in charge in the place throughout our meal.We had a fantastic weekend in the city....A stunning place, with loads of lovely places to eat and see....THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. IT DESERVES TO BE SHUT DOWN AND THE STAFF THAT SERVED US, SACKED FOR THEIR POOR SERVICE AND RACISM.The local Tourist board should try and deal with them, as this place does nothing for the city but make its customers angry and disappointedClearly the owner is happy in cashing in on the tourist trade, safe in the knowledge that most customers he or she has, aren't local, so won't be back. They can sit back and cash in on the next load of unsuspecting tourists. Grrrrrrrr......"

This isn't my first review for Sea Me. Used to come once a week my first year. After that a bit less as my restaurant experiences expanded. Quite liked sitting at the bar and having a good experience. Had been a while since the last visit and a friend wanted sushi. So I recommended Sea Me.As we approached the door a young Muslim couple with their stroller arrived at the same time. Respectfully, I let them go in before us. The gentlemen asked if there was a table for them. The female attendant at the door asked, ""Do you have a reservation"" His response was, ""We do not."" She tells him, ""nothing is open for tonight without a reservation."" He then asked, ""are you sure nothing is available"" ""Not tonight"" she replies. So they left. My friend and I requested to sit at the bar and was told there was space we could see there was and to wait a few minutes. We had no reservation. Then another two people came in and asked for a table without reservations. Just as the Muslim couple did before us. The attendant tells them, ""yes just wait a few minutes."" After that another couple walks in and asked for a table with no reservations and they were also told it was possible in a few minutes. ONLY the Muslin couple were turned away. This was quite sad to witness. The Muslim couple were dressed like any other tourists minus the wife's headscarf and were told there was absolutely no table available. Sea Me should be ashamed of themselves and this woman should be fired for her blatant racism. It's not fair and not right at all. Such a disgrace. Truly was disturbing. Being a Sunday, it didn't seem like there was any upper management working or something would have been said. For that I mention this on TA."

We were then rudely asked if we wanted any drinks with our lunch set which came with coffee because they would only serve the coffee after the main  normally the customer decides when they drink and eat! Like most tourists walking around in the sun we had bottles of water which we placed on the table on arrival. With no one drinking from them surly waitress rudely warned another friend that drinking that water was prohibited even though he hadnt so much as touched it! Maybe they were just generally rude and not actually racist! Not so; we noted that an older white couple came in after us and were served coffee with a smile and a thank you which confirmed that our group which hails from 4 countries around the world was singled out for the special treatment by the young waitress. After waiting 20 or 30 minutes no food was forthcoming which was odd given the caf was nearly empty when we ordered. When a friend asked the less hostile waiter how long he expected the food to take his response was lets see what happens!!! Well, what happened was we left disgusted and disillusioned that in a place that survives on tourism such behaviour exists and is tolerated! Everywhere else in Funchal we went was friendly and cordial, so help yourself and society in general by not eating here and endorsing racism."

I made an online reservation, however when I arrived the hostess lied to my face and told me it was closed, even though the restuarant was supposed to be open for the whole entire day. I then told her that I had a reservation and she said she would go and check and left my friend and I standing outside in the rain. Eventually we were let into the restuarant, where I saw several diners, meaning that the restuarant was not closed like she had said earlier.After being seated we were left without menus for 15 minutes until I asked for them. We were ignored throughout our dinner, while the waiters served everyone else without the same issues.I do not understand why we received differential treatment. The only difference between myself and the other diners is my race, since I am a black woman. I do not know if this is the reason for the horrible treatment, but I cannot think of any other reasons why the staff treated us in a different way than the other diners.I will not be returning to this establishment."

Today we went back to eat the same dish again , the same thing happened again : the beef still with lots of blood ! And then returned to the kitchen and cooked again.

So we left and then In the afternoon : 5 o'clock , the boss called us and said he was mad that 2 of us went to lunch instead of 1. This is so Ridiculous !!!

It was like he was competing for the title of the most arrogant waiter ever. First we ordered drinks and my girlfriends drink was poured aggressively into the glass. At that time we did not think that much of it, but then I made my order for my dinner. My girlfriend was not having dinner as she wasn't hungry. After having made the order we waited for 30 minutes after which I asked for my order. Clearly it had been forgotten either by purpose or by accident, but when it came, no excuse was offered. After I had ate my dinner my plate was removed 15 seconds after my last bite and I asked promptly for the bill. Then we waited 10 minutes for the bill and eventually we had to ask another waiter for it, that actually brought it right away. The funny thing about this was that it seemed like our waiter was waiting his other tables with much more enthusiasm than ours. My girlfriend is black and given his difference in behaviour between us and the rest of the tables he waited, we actually feel like he was making a difference because of skin colour.

Dont go if youre not Austrian or dont live in Austria. I booked a table for myself as I was visiting from Vienna on holiday and was recommended this place by my boyfriends friend who lives here as a place for hearty Austrian food and large portions. I didnt each much all day and after walking around Salzburg for around 6 hours I decided to head to the restaurant. I arrived 15 minutes early and was made aware that I was very very early. I said was happy to wait and have a beer but a lady came and took me straight to my table upstairs. The whole upstairs Was empty, despite the fact that they said they were very busy and highly booked up on the time of booking. I got given the menu and I was sat on a table for around 7 people by myself , which was strange but I got over it. 10 mins later a group of 4 Austrian people came in and sat on a table behind me. After around 15 more mins the lady came back and took my menu and said I had to order the lunch menu, despite it being 5.15 and I said I would wait til 5.30 to get the main meals. I had already picked what I wanted after looking at the menu for 20 mins and asked if i could order it anyway, seeing as the Austrian table behind me hadnt been given the lunch menus / had them swapped too. I was refused the food I wanted and so went for something off the lunch menu despite the fact of wanting to walk out at this point. What made it worse was that my tiny snack was served at exactly the same time as other tables were being served food from the main menu, which made me feel very angry and discriminated against. Another Asian couple was given the lunch menu at the same time, and later on in the evening the lady tried to seat a family of 4 on my table with me they were British. After a while of speaking lots of German to them and them saying it was strange / awkward she moved them to a table next to me and left them to order from the main menu by this point. I left a small tip as the other servers seemed to treat me well, but I will not be going again and left very very angry and upset and disappointed.

However, the racism command in the recent post triggered my curiosity and I feel the fair way to make a judgement is to have the first hand experience . So here I am, a solo Asian traveller came here to have a try. I will start from the food...I guess I probably ordered the wrong food . Everyone was taking highly about the schnitzel, I chose to have Herb Pasta and Creamy asparagus soup. Both dishes were too salty to my like  this is my third time in Austria, I feel Austrian do love their salt!  It reads in the menu that the herb pasta is a special Vienna cuisine . It is special. I have never had anything quite like this before  pasta cut in squareish shape and mixed with pickled cabbage , but it is not to say I liked it very much though. Base on the satisfaction of the food, I rate this restaurant 3 stars. The salad on the side was the best! Now service I got a table very quickly and the waiter  manager  greeted me as soon as I arrived. I was given a fourseats table with reservation sign on that  I guess the manager was happy to let me use the table with the assumption that I wont occupy the table for too long . The service was prompt . I was given an English menu as the waiter realised I didnt speak German. I was satisfied with the service. Nothing outstanding but I have nothing to complain either.I kind of feel racism is always a heavy accusation, in saying that I do understand perception and feelings are always subjective. I do not wish to pick a side but I hope I can provide my personal dinning experience as a comparison. "

My advice to the owners would be to put up a sign that says Asians only, that would save us all a lot of trouble. happy Diners is the name, bout if your'e of a Western back ground you could leave anything but happy!."

We saw the restaurant on a quick walk around earlier that day and decided to return for lunch. We arrived around 1pm and asked if they had a table for 2. The gentleman standing outside didnt even grace us with a verbal reply but took one look at my girlfriend and then shook his hands. We did not have a reservation; however, an American couple behind us were immediately shown to a table without a booking. I was absolutely shocked that my girlfriend would be treated by anyone in this way and would avoid this restaurant at all costs out of principle because of this blatantly racist treatment."

Heard that Rockpool was a very decent restaurant and we dressed up to have a nice dinner on boxing day.It is true that the food was quite nice, but it was a pity that we had to spend quite a money only to feel racism and ignored. This is my first time that I leave a review on trip advisor, but i am doing so, so that other people get treated properly for that worth of time and money.The table was located on the 2nd floor, and there was a gentleman attending us, and I expect him to be from Europe for his accent. We had to wait a long time every time we needed something, and it was so annoying to wait during the dinner. You should place more people to attend the guests if one person is not enough for serving. The bread was so hard that it nearly cost my teeth to get a bite, so we asked for different one, and we did not get that, although we waited 10 mins, 20 mins...and finally we could not have that during dinner.Also, when we ordered just one dessert because we were so full, the waitor said ""just one dessert that's it hahaha!!!"" and it was very very uncomfortable, rude, humiliating and felt as if he were laughing at us. You smile to people not laugh at them, and your restaurant needs to educate the waitor if he does not know that. Actually everything was perfect including the food and the place, but just one person attending us was so unpleasant that it ruined the whole dinner, when spending quite a bit of a money.Yes, he might have had a hard day working on holiday seasons, but we felt racism because he was so respectful, attending and friendly to other tables who seemed to be like white Americans and Australians, and us being Asians, we felt left out and ignored for the whole dinner. I am aware that Rockpool is a very highly rated restaurant with good food, and I am writing this review so that you can improve and people get treated with repect / have nice experience at your place."

The bouncer outside was extremely rude and threatening from the outset. I gathered he felt insulted I didn't speak either French or Arabic.After I explained to him that I was there to eat at the restaurant he proceeded to call someone from inside whom I gathered to be a manager. The manager came and told me he was there to solve my problem. I proceeded to tell him that the way his staff apoke to me was quite rude and while i don't speak Arabic I have some basic language and I coild gather the insulting language he just heard his staff refer to me as. He denied it but the bottom line was that there was a problem he was there to help me with. I told him this feels like I was not welcome to the place and I will not be wasting his time or my money in the establishment and i will be writing a review of the place.. To which he proceeded to say F... You M..F... I was quite taken aback by the uncouth behaviour but left anyway.I would urge anyone who is black  or anyone who doesn't want to support racist establishments to reconsider their decisions on going to this establishment. I know it is one incident and maybe it was a bad day of miscommunication but i have traveled more than 20 countries and seen my share of bad behavior and this was not bad service but also an establishment that thinks it should choose clientele along colour lines.

There was a very loud drunk woman who insulted staff members, patrons, and people outside the bar. When we alerted the management and security they refused to kick her out. The drunk woman claimed she works at honeysuckle. I came with a group of friends and this drunk woman was yelling the moment we arrived. I heard her arguing with another customer and yelling at the waitress several times.Then an hour later, she really showed her true colors.Outside the bar, there were a group of young men quietly watching the soccer game.The drunk woman who was still drinking at a nearby table insulted them calling them poor monkeys. Then she started taking pictures of them. When the men protested she said more racist insults.There were two other tables of customers watching this gross behavior. One of the customers told the woman that she shouldn't take pictures of those men and she has been the aggressor. The woman became louder and angrier and started insulting one of the customers with racist insults and even insulted the people of ghana. She used a series of profane words and screamed at everyone at the bar.However the worst part was when a manager came with security and they didn't throw her out. They told the customers not to engage with her. Then the female manager sat down with the drunk woman. The female manager and the drunk woman were the only non black people there. It's very disappointing that even in ghana, people bring their racist attitudes and try to establish their racist culture here. If the situation was reversed and a black woman had insulted white patrons at the bar, she would be forced to leave. Yet at honeysuckle, you can insult black people, Ghanaians, and the manager will sit down and join you.I cannot come here again and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I hope this place shuts down and the management and owners learn that racism has no place in ghana."

Mediocre food, racism and questionable service","I booked it for lunch because it's in Asia's Top 50. Now they have a Michelin star and after my experience here I thought this was all so fake. I came here alone and I arrived earlier than expected. I was made to sit outside to wait because the table ""was not ready"". After 15 minutes I was seated so no issue there. The other couple who came shortly after me was told the same thing. They were both seated 10 minutes after I got mine. However, the table that was given to them was already ready long ago, I have no idea why can't they seat people when the table is already ready Must you make people wait outside This is a super pretentious move.I ordered food for one, and coffee. Beef chilli basil  clear pork soup. The bill came up to around THB 1k but was my meal worth it To start with the person who served my food  as she served every other table she explained what was it but when it comes to mine she did not. I felt this was absolutely unprofessional, is this some kind of discrimination/racism So white looking tourists gets an explanation while Asians like us gets ignored I don't see the reason to selectively explain to people they want to. I immediately raised this to the manager and after my complaint, everyone gets equal treatment. In terms of food taste  beef and chilli basil, mostly wasn't even meat to begin with. Fats, tendon and all the slimy stuff minced on a plate. Clear pork soup wasn't attractive. The only thing that was worth mentioning was the perfectly fried egg. To pay THB1k for mediocre food and very bad service, it is certainly not worth it. A single simple Thai dish like this did not score high, why would I even order anything else Never knew that an establishment like this deserves to receive a single Michelin star. I will definitely not return nor recommend this place to anyone, unless they fix their staffs and improve on the food. That being said, the manager who spoke a little more English than the rest was alright  at least she acknowledged it.I would rather go to Osha Thai/Paste instead  much much better overall package; food, service and satisfaction."

I am Indian, living in Thailand for 25 years now. My 2 Indian, also been living in Thailand for a long time, and looked up good seafood restaurants and this seemed to have good reviews. We tried to walk in to the pier side of this restaurant, but were refused by the mean looking lady up front. She told us it was full and to go over to the opposite side, which was by the street. We though all right, it is 8 so many people must come early to this restaurant and went ahead to sit on the street side. The group of westerners who were waiting behind us to go to the pier side were instantly let in. That confused us very much, and when I spoke in Thai to the lady with a sourpuss face in front, she just kept repeating that it was full. When I asked in Thai how come the westerners were allowed in, she again repeated it was full and refused to let us go to the pier side. Oh well. We walked away. Not sure if the rule of only westerners allowed in the pier side comes from the restaurant management or just the sourpuss lady up front, but the racism is visible.

U are just depraved people ! You're not welcome in Turkey, get out of this coffee shop !"" I was really angry but I was thinking ""Ok this is another jerk on Earth"". But what really shocked me is that the waiters only ask him one time to calm down and go back to his table but he as expected didn't even listen, so we had to leave to get rid of him, but no waiters didn't apologize, they even make us pay for our coffee and the best is for the end once we were out , we saw one man shaking the hand of the guy. So please if you're European don't go there because we must be proud of ourselves and also because this is obviously dangerous for is cause we are not welcome !!!!I have never been as humiliated !!!!

We were rudely told we couldn't sit there as it was a table for 4, before being shown to a table for 4! Since we were thirsty and nowhere else around was open, we accepted it and ordered a couple of beers. All the beers are a similar price but the glasses differ in size. The price we paid for a thimble of beer was a shocker. Not as shocking as watching a local couple come in and swiftly be shown to the window table. Suddenly it was no longer a table for 4! Rude service, expensive drinks, and a terrible atmosphere. Maybe it's just me, but I don't feel that Eric Claptons 'Tears in Heaven' is going to lift the atmosphere in a pub :"

Unfortunately, this whiskey lounge is anything but. They're already in a fairly dodgy building and despite their fantastic selection, there are very few people. Why would a place like this in such a busy area be so quiet It's simple. The employees have an extreme arrogant view and are simply racist. You don't get treated the same when you aren't the right color and you will see this when you visit. It's 2018 guys, get it together if you want to remain in business."

Took ages for us to get our menus, a further 10 minutes until our order was taken, including a simple drinks order!Whilst we waited another 20 minutes for our food, a couple sat near is who arrived 10 minutes after us were quickly seen to with menus, drinks and even their food before we were! We also noticed every diner had been given a glass of hot water apart from us! After 'forgetting' we had ordered two meals instead of one, we also found that some of ther waitresses did not want to serve us, one getting a trainee colleague to do it so that she didn't have to. Another waitress also waved our request for help away!I was shocked and appalled at how a restaurant and it's staff could make a paying customer feel so awful about themselves, especially as we had done nothing to upset or annoy them! The only explanation for how we were treated compared to others was that we were not locals. We refused to pay the 10 service charge they applied to our bill, and I suggest that unless you want to role play how discrimination feels you should not eat here."

But I guess there is always a first time for everything. We arrived in Dubrovnik around 10:00 pm one night last week and after checking into our suites, asked our hostess for recommendations on places to eat. She immediately recommended Wanda as it right next door. So off we went as we were starving after a delayed plane ride from Berlin. We glanced at the menu and waited to be seated. After about a 5 minute wait, the maitred', who is also the owner, came up to us. I asked for a table for 4. There were lots of empty tables inside and a couple out on the street. But he looked at me and said they were closed. I was a little surprised because: 1. We had just watched him seat another couple, and 2. in our experience restaurants in Europe rarely close that early. My wife said she did not get a good vibe from the owner, but the rest of us, which is me and my two kids told her she was just overreacting. They must really be closed. No matter, we found another place to eat just down the street.As we really wanted to try this restaurant, we decided we would try again to have dinner there the next night. We made sure we got there early this time, so around 9:00 pm. we made out way there. We waited by the entrance, while the waiter walked by us several times. And so did the owner, at least twice. After keeping us waiting longer than the previous night the owner comes up to us and again I ask for a table for 4. He says they are full. Again there are at least 10 empty tables. So it's now clear that we are not wanted. We head off to a different restaurant where we are warmly welcomed and seated immediately, just like the previous night. The next morning we let our hostess know what had happened and she was puzzled. So I asked her if it was because of our skin colour and she said no that was not possible. Now the mother of our hostess does not speak english, but she was very friendly and did her best to communicate with us. So we let her know in english and sign language about our experience. And asked her to find out what the problem was. She promptly went over to the restaurant and when she came back a few minutes later she was visibly upset. She pointed to my arm, and when I said skincolour she nodded. And went on to indicate that the owner was a nasty person. She expressed with gestures and sign language how there were many people of colour in the town. But kept shaking her head at how we had been treated. So it turns out my wife was right when she said she got a really bad vibe from the owner of Wandas.I would love to have written a review about their food and I am sure it must be good. But unfortunately I will never know. And they will never get my business when we go back to Dubrovnik. This was the only bad experience we had here or anywhere else in Europe. The rest of our stay was awesome. And the other restaurants like LAJK that we ate at were very good. But this experience did leave a bad taste. How unfortunate that one incident can mar a perfectly good trip."

I visited this restaurant for evening tea and snacks because I was staying in same hotel. I was deeply disappointed and never ate here again despite staying in their hotel.First of all, its a sensitive issue and I am not a professional writer. But I will put it as carefully as I can. This is possibly only place where I have seen a very obvious and blatant racism against Indians. I understand that some waiters want to serve foreigners well in expectations of fat tips. But nowhere else I have found this attitude blatant, obvious and at the cost of Indian patrons. As soon as we entered waiter gave us a look as if we were not supposed to be there. Hello Mr Waiter, wake up. I am staying with you. Dont expect me to go out for tea.Anyway, back to food. They took 45 minutes to serve tea. Then, I almost vomited on first sip. My wife immediately figured out that they had put salt instead of sugar by mistake. So we call the waiter and he is not even sorry. He simply takes away the tea and replaces it after some time. This time no sugar in tea. And no sugar was to be found anywhere. Attitude of waiter was such that we couldnt dare to call him again and ask for such luxury as sugar!We tasted few other dished we had ordered and didnt find anything worth eating. So we decided to sign the bill and walk out to look for another restaurant. That was the last I entered that restaurant."

However, I can honestly say that the blatant racism that I experienced at Chillis on Wolf Road, Albany NY left a really bad taste in my mouth. I will never go there again for the rest of my life. It was my son's birthday, and we went there along with few friends to have a nice dinner. Our server was an older lady and as she took our drink order and tried to engage with us her energy seemed off. After she returned with our beverages and was in the middle of taking our meal order she said ""give me two minutes, I'll be right back"". My friend looked at me saying that's weird. I didn't think much of it. I assumed she might have to run to the restroom or something that would justify her running off in such manner. After she left out table she hurried around to a ""white couple"" who had been seated as she was about to take our order. Apparently she couldn't allow them to wait even though they came in after my group. That did not sit well with me. I watched as she placed utensils on their table, took their drink order and left to ring it in. I walked to the hostess stand and requested a different server. The hostess told me that she would get her manager in order for me to get my request. After waiting for a few minutes a male manager walked over. I told him what had happened and he didn't seem to care. He didn't say I'm sorry, or anything that you would expect of a manager in customer service. All he said was I'll see if I can find someone. I watched him walk to the back of the restaurant in the kitchen area as he talked and laugh with the same server who deserted my table to assist the ""white"" couple. At that point I knew my business wasn't welcome there and I walked out. That has been the worst service that I've ever experienced in my life. African Americans are not welcome there. Don't go there! That experience left me with a number of thoughts, like what do they really do to the food that they serve us. That is very disheartening."

I was with a group of friends having drinks at Altstadt Restaurant in Swakopmund when a white man walked past our table, looked at me, turned to his friend and said ""Kyk daai kak"". He turned, looked back at me and said ""Hy moet daai kak afsny"". These comments were completely unprovoked and very disrespectful. As I was with my girlfriend who hates violence I chose not to retaliate and instead asked to speak to the manager. He refused to see me so I got up after an hour and went to speak to him. He asked me to just drop it, so I insisted he deal with the matter and a waitress jumped in and explained that I should let it go because they were drunk and as such they were not going to do anything about it. I insisted that it's unacceptable and he immediately rasied his voice, blaming me for the altercation and threatened to kick me out. So we went back and forth then I told him I won't settle the bill if he insists on kicking me out and doing nothing to him and he just told me to go have a beer and not cause trouble. I refused to settle the bill but my grilfriend and her sister insisted and they settled it. I dont want to trash talk this establishment, because the service was amazing, the beer was great but an owner who condones racism just promotes a racist environment. So I wouldn't recommend supporting this establishment until such a time that a change is made and situations like this are dealt with appropriately. As such I would like all my friends and family to share this message on their facebook page and/or Google review and boycott this establishment.

It was 43 degrees so I was dressed in slippers and shorts. I entered the club because it specifically said that the dressing was casual as it was mentioned that on the Google my business page check out screenshot. I entered the club at 4 pm and they did not stop me. Later at 9.30 PM I went out with permission to buy something and when I returned they refused me entry because I was in shorts. I talked to the same manager that I had taken permission from but he said that he was unable to help me and I could not enter. I think that this was really bad behaviour and as I was talking to the manager I was surrounded by bouncers who were threatening and rude. Finally I was forced to leave the club which was quite bad and was left feeling betrayed by the management. They should have told me earlier the club rules and casual dressing should not have been mentioned on the Google my business page as I was going with that information. So yes my whole night was ruined and somehow I left with a bad impresssion of Rajasthani hospitality which is supposed to be impeccable. I am sure that if I was a foreigner dressed in shorts I wouldn't have experienced this but in a way I saw racism towards indians at work at this place. They ruined my night and my entire vist to Jaipur. Really disappointed. :

My 80 year old mother has a membership there. The daytime staff know us, respect us, and treat us very well. There is a world surf competition in Jac this weekend and Jac Blu has brought in extra security which I understand, however they are thugs and bullies. I was sitting at a table, having a drink, and had my foot up on another chair which everyone does, my mother does, is not uncommon, and are metal lounge chairs at a pool. A security guy came over to tell me to remove my foot but didn't just do it nicely or respectfully, because regardless of my opinion, if he had I would have just done it. He brought a big, bully, bouncer over to intimidate me and blatantly puffed up, looked at me and treated me aggressively, then even after I removed my foot asked me if there was a problem. I told him I complied and him intimidating intentionally is wrong and I was going to pay my bill and leave. He then called over 6 other security staff who stood their, laughed, harassed, made jokes, and intentionally continued to try and intimidate me. I paid my bill, tipped my waiter, who was embarassed and apologized, and started to leave. As I was leaving I was continually harassed, threatened, and bullied. At that point I got onto the street outside of Jac Blu being followed by the big bouncer. I felt threatened and in danger and turned around, told him I complied, payed my bill, and willingly left with no incident but if he followed me onto the street I would be forced to react in a defensive manner. Then as I was walking up the street they continually harassed, made comments, threatened me, and the bouncer told the security guy to pull his machete. I told them that I was leaving, off the property, and if he pulled his machete I would justifiably use any means necessary to defend myself. The only time I go to Jac Blu is in the day with my mother because they blatantly mistreat ""gringos"", take advantage of us, and disrespect us. This was a blatant act of racism and agression. I would not recommend this place as a spoteam for tourists to visit and will also be taking legal measures to further follow up on this appalling treatment."

The truth is we arrived on a busy day with rugby being played in good view of our table. The fact that you can watch sports on a TV or outside is a bonus. The fact you can get a 1kg burger or monster Tbone or 1/2kg cut of meat on tap or an amazing array of beers. This is a pub environment or a steakhouse environment or a sports bar. I have had many periperi sauces but there is a unique edge to this one, although not hot, it is tasty. On principle based on what I have read in the reviews I will not comment on the service or management and I hope that this gets sorted out quickly as it will have an impact on whether I return again or not. However price/benefit ratio makes this establishment a great afternoon venue for a party with mates. "

I was visiting from the US and had a horrible racist experience here. We sat at the bar and half way through my first glass, a peanut hit my shoulder. At first I thought it was a random occurrence but after the 3rd peanut hit me I knew it was more than intentional. Now normally I would not blame the bar for something its patrons do, but the 2 grown men doing it were standing right next to the bar host stand, where the host was in fact standing and chatting with them. So I imagine he was aware of what they were doing. My friend who is from Argentina confronted them, but they denied it, and continued throwing the peanuts at me. The Host and bar tender did nothing to intervene. Needless to say we left, and I will not be returning to an establishment that does not seem to welcome people of color, which is the only thing I can attribute the interaction to, as the peanuts where only aimed at me, not my friend or anyone else in the bar."

We sat down looked at the menu and I ordered a pricey 5 jasmine tea. The waiter looked directly at my boyfriend and said ""it was policy we both had to order something."" The ""OR LEAVE"" was unspoken but clearly understood.I looked around; it was pretty empty, almost nearly deserted. So it wasn't a space issue. I also hadn't been made aware of this policy when I had been in the cafe before and been the only person ordering something. So it wasn't a policy issue. Then i saw it: my boyfriend was the only brown person in this korean/asian staffed, mostly korean clientele cafe. Yup, it was a wrong ""type of customer"" issue. I remembered how the weird looks from other staff as we had entered and browsed the artwork greatly differed from their friendliness sansbrown boyfriend. I felt horrible that i'd brought my partner into such a bizarre situation in my selfish pursuit of some tea and ambiance. We looked at each other, gave the ""NOPE"" glance and decided to bail on this ""cute"" cafe. The shock of being basically kicked out FOR NO GOOD REASON...seriously the place was deserted....left me speechless and angry.

We were not checked on once after receiving our food and the next time we saw the waiter he was bringing the bill. I've never felt so disrespected, appalled and a little hurt to be treated like this because of my skin color.

We were 3 girls in Huntington beach for 3 nights a doctor, a teacher and a scientist, not J1 students  definitely don't go to HB if you're looking for a J1 and just wanted a normal night out. We were all over 21, and presented our passports at the door only to be told that they weren't legitimate forms of ID despite the fact that over 120 countries in the world seem to think that passports are legitimate. We were told that the only way we could get in was to be personally escorted in by a police officer. Meanwhile many Americans could easily walk in after displaying whatever ID they had on them. This is an common thing to experience in HB. Ask any waiting staff in the restaurants in main street. That's where you'll get some honesty. They'll be straight up with you and tell you that many places will turn you away if you're Irish. The Killarney bar across the road is exactly the same. We argued with the door man and repeatedly told him that he was being racist and discriminatory. We insisted on seeing the manager and said that their door policy reminded us of the 1960's policy of ""No Blacks, No Dogs, No Irish"". We only were allowed in after the customers outside with us started arguing on our behalf with the staff. After all that, it wasn't even worth it. Apart from the English football scarf wrong country guys! hanging behind the bar, this place was no different to any other dump you'd encounter anywhere else.Overall, my experience of HB as a young person was awful and I would actively discourage any young Europeans from visiting here. I really regret going. It's a sleepy boring area with nothing to do. It really is only a surfing beach and a main street with overpriced souvenirs shops. If you want a fun nightlife experience, go to Vegas. If you want a nice beach holiday, go to the Caribbean, or Spain!"

My first encounter on the day of its opening with the founder Akash and I hear this statement....wow! Really it's another Tommy Hilfiger scoop for the broadsheet here if you want to pickup. Wish I had recorded this conversation but only if I had known what I am about to witness is racism. I wouldn't rule out a place just because of my brief conjecture and decided to give this place a shot purely for food and service. Went on number of occasions and found it pretty busy. Saw the owner at the counter and congratulated him again. Got a cold shoulder yet again, this is incredible for a restaurant owner who has filled seats in the first week of opening. A little smile or sign of joy would have done the trick but no his attitude remained what you call of a server who is very disgruntled by working long hours and under paid.This story gets better so read on....I decided to give them another shot to see how they fair in outdoor catering or rather their catering with delivery option not available so you better pick up despite ordering four days in advance. Fair enough restaurant is busy and they don't want to delay orders. But messing up order for over 30 people Yes that's painful not for the restaurant but for the guests and the host as they go home hungry. Deconstructing the scenario here:Day 1 Called their catering number to enquire about the Diwali package a week prior. Response received yes they can do delivery and make changes but need to check the slots so send an email. Call answered by guess who None other than the owner Akash.Day 2 Visited restaurant and ordered the Thali to taste the food and ensure we know what we are ordering. The aloo gobhi served in restaurant is totally different from their catering menu and no information given whatsoever. The gobhi  cauliflower we got was uncooked with hard potatoes. So essentially nothing for vegetarian guests during the party.Same day spoke to a very polite gentleman Emyr. He answered questions but couldn't confirm the delivery and order details so requested us to email or call on the catering number.Phoned them same afternoon and got in touch with Rana  another owner.After answering our questions which she seemed rather reluctant, I told her about my observation that how I have enquired about catering with number of people in last couple of days and no one seems to have the exact information and everyone says to call the catering number which is what I have been doing. Instead of trying to fix the problem she abruptly said, "" no one is forcing you to order with us""...yes Maam, you are not forcing usand this kind of attitude is unpalatable leaving a very very bad taste before even eating your food.Day 3 Ordered food for 30 people as we had a party and this restaurant despite the fetid attitude has some decent food. Day 4 My guests went home hungry why because they messed my order for over 30 people who were vegetarian and got Saag chicken for their mains and uncooked gobhi. Round of applause for this upcoming restaurant which has been completely successful in ruining my experience not on one but every occasion. ...Bravo!!The concept of this restaurant has a good potential only if the owner evolve their demeanor from being arrogant to humble and start paying attention to their customer service.On contrary the service staff I have come across has been good, polite and smiley. The food is decent not extraordinary. Expensive yes for the kind of the restaurant which I would pay happily but they can't expect people to suck up to what they offer especially ""the racist, I don't care attitude""."

At this place, you order your dim sum by checking off what you'd like on a menu, rather than having the carts pushed around. This means its a little less chaotic than other places of the size. Nice selection of dim sum types, with some interesting options I haven't seen elsewhere  like salty dumplings with pumpkin and multiple different types of green vegetable. However, it was kind of disconcerting as a group of nonAsians to have the hostess walk up to us and say ""Gweilo"" while frowning means 'white ghosts' or 'white devils'. She then walked us past a large number of empty tables to seat us at arguably the worst table in the restaurant, stuck at the kitchen entrance where there was a buffet table being used by the waitstaff to bus tables, prep stuff, etc. The least attractive corner of the restaurant.We were then ignored. A few of the hot dishes arrived cold, such as fried taro dumplings. Aside from food being dropped off, we didn't have any service, although the staff was coming and going to tables near ours. Trying to get anyone's attention to get our bill took so long we contemplated leaving without it  doubt anyone would have noticed. When we finally paid, the person forgot to bring back my credit card for a good 15 minutes. Upon leaving, we noticed another group of Gweilo being led to the same table.Luckily, the food and our own company was good enough that we just laughed about the hilariously bad service.We ordered way too much, and the bill came to about 110 for 5 people, but again, we ordered way too much.If you do go here, make sure to try the abalone."

Anyway, after we finished our meal with the exception of that heinous cornbread, I paid and went to the restroom. Upon returning, my friend informed me that Katie looked in the bill book in front of her saying, Im just going to do some quick math, and after seeing that I tipped her properly, she tried to cover her rudeness by adding, I just wanted to make sure she didnt leave her card. I have been in customer service for the last 12 years, including serving tables, and never have I been so rude and disrespectful to check a tables tip in front of them. Im just going to do some quick math implies that she expected us, as AfricanAmerican women, to leave a poor tip. In all honestly, on a 98 bill, I absolutely planned on tipping her 20, but I was thinking of giving more because of the fact that we were the last table and, as Ive already said, Im usually treated with respect. Im glad I didnt. This is the ultimate problem: The racism that Boulder tries to pretend it doesnt have has made things so unbearable for my friend that she has given up trying to make life work here, and we were sharing one last meal together in this town. I myself have endured this trouble for the last 2  years: I have written about it, been published in Boulder Weekly, and have called it out on air at KGNU. Katie feeling the need to assume she wouldnt be tipped, AND CHECKING IN FRONT OF US, is another example of Boulders regular passiveaggressive and microaggressive attitude towards People of Color, who are already few and far between in this socalled sanctuary city. I even made a point to ask Katie to her face if it was good enough math for her. All she could do was the SAME NONCHALANT GIGGLE THAT ALL OF BOULDER SEEMS TO DO when being called out for its postracial lies. Boulder claims to be aware of itself and receptive to new ideas and people, but it has shown me over and over that that is an illusion this town feeds itself and projects to the rest of the world. The more I witness this, the more I am going to report it. As often as I go to the Denver Chophouse, I know for a fact they would have NEVER treated us like this. So, I guess I should say thanks to Katie for displaying Boulders true colors isnt that punny. I hope she can do the math on how many sites I post this review."

I have a daughter, adopted from China I am Caucasian. The Barnum Ave Subway had a young blonde girl working there with a bigtime BAD attitude. I went in with a male friend who she apparently had flirted with previously. She didnt seem happy to see us all together. She made remarks like ""YOU are all together!"" with horrified undertones. She was rude. NOT OK. The one at the dock....just plain stingy/cheap. My daughter is a vegetarian. She would get the kids meal, with American cheese  a few veggies.....I would ask for a few extra slices of cheese. Since she wasnt getting the coldcuts...and I am paying the same. No brainer, right I mean, meat is more expensive than cheese anyway! The manager Indian or Bangladeshi American gave me a hard time, then flat out refused. NEVER again. I won't go to Subway. The one across from Wendy's on Main Street isnt much better last I was there. There was one employee female who was great.....friendly, had the ""Customer comes first"" attitude that businesses should have. She was fired. I dont know the details. Probably for giving out extra slices of cheeses. Ha. The next girl young, Hispanic refused the extra cheese.....wouldnt give me her NAME! Unbelievable. Pretty sad, since Subway was founded in CT! But since they are franchised.....not much you can do, except go to Social Media. Yep. Gonna go there! There are, of course, some that are great. West Haven, Waterbury near Coco Cay, etc. But....IMO avoid the Stratford Subways. They SUCK. And if you read my reviews, I do not usually give bad reviews like this. This is the honest truth."

I've always had a blast there; the bartenders are fun, good bands play at night, anything goes... Still agreeing with all of that, this past weekend we saw the owner kicking someone out apparently because of the way he dressed. It was an obvious case of racism, although we can't be 100 sure of what happened before, but the owner was kicking out a black guy and giving him a hard time because he had on lowhanging pants. The guy getting kicked out didn't put up a fight and walked out with his head hanging, obviously embarrassed.My friend asked the bouncer what was happening, and the bouncer shrugged and said ""he's the owner, he can do whatever he wants.""Just wanted to put it out there so that others can see this. What a shame, because it's always been one of my favorite places to hang out in Dewey."

This was my first time in this restaurant and we were treated unfair and it took approx.20 minutes for the waitress to take our order and she also waited on a couple that came in after us and when we asked her why did she wait on the first she went on and said well they are regulars and I know what they want. Personally I thought that was a bit rude and unprofessional that is something that you would say to anyone who is new at your restaurant.

I went there on Monday, Martin Luther King Day of all days for breakfast with a dear friend of mine. The treatment that he received was pure racism. We sat at the counter. He came in after me. I took a seat, explained to the waitress Leslie that my friend would be joining me momentarily and could she please clear the place next to me. She did and all seemed well until he sat down. Her entire demeanor changed. In today's world it is hard for me to even fathom people with this thought process. Much less write about it. However, I can not and will not let it go untold. I am a white female R.N. My friend is a black male who was a Marine. He now works at the V.A. He has dedicated his life to our country. Besides that he is one of the finest individuals I've had the privilege of knowing. I asked Leslie to take our order. She took mine and when it was his turn she said ""Well, I wasn't that ready"". She turned my order into the kitchen then proceeded to clear tables and do side work. After 10 minutes I called her over. I said ""You are aware we are together"" She then grudgingly took his order. A few minutes later a Hispanic man sat down at the counter. He was by himself. He sat there for 10 minutes or so. Leslie never acknowledged him. He finally got up and left. My food came out. She served me. Then she served a white male's food who she had taken his order after my friends. I would not eat until my friend was served. After we left my friend said ""Wow!"" See he is too much of a gentleman to do that in the restaurant. I called the restaurant and spoke to Jill, the manager. I gave her my name and phone number. She said the owner would call me back. That was 48 hours ago. I will never set foot in this establishment again. I am appalled at the treatment that my friend, a vetrian received, the Hispanic male and who knows who else. Wow! This is 2019."

I have been a customer of them since they first opened with different owners and they need to hire more staff and better staff. So if you are AfricanAmerican or Black Or Hispanic I would not suggest you go there because I don't believe that they want us there anymore. So sorry to see the place go down because it was a wonderful place to eat breakfast and lunch and I really enjoyed it my son enjoyed it.

WoW,"It has been a long time since I have experience racism from someone. My family and I planned to have a birthday celebration at this restaurant. My family consisted of about 20 people. Some of our family was videoing the event when the manager came out and ask us not to video her crew. The manager had a harsh tone as though we were children. We politely told her we were just videoing the event and not her crew. Before the manager came out one of our family members was served a rotten baked potatoe and ask for the manager. The manager never did address the rotten potatoe but address the family about our phones. The cashier acting so rude to our family, she continued looking at our table and talking about our family. We felt like we were in some movie made back in the 1950s. We asked for the manager but she never came out to speak to us because she was in the back calling the sheriff department on us. I explained to the lady we have not committed any crime and why did she call the sheriff department on our family because we were black americans. The manager rudely laughed at me. I asked for the owner number and she said the owner told her to call the sheriff. My family politely paid the bills and left their premises. Black Americans still have to deal with people that hate us because of our colors but we do not have to settle for this treatment."

There was not a variety of cultures represented in the restaurant either as wait staff or customers, so I guess Im not surprised by the racism displayed by our placement.

As we walked in, the front area staff stared us down with what looked like shock to see us. We are all African Americans. As we walked away to be seated I looked back at the three ladies and you could see them looking at each other like ""what are they doing here"". we were seated and I am not sure he is the owner or just the manager went to various tables at which stopped to greet and talked to people while doing this at tables next to us he did not say a word like we were invisible. i think he realized how bad it looked that instead of our waiter serving us our meals he did but still not with a friendly smile. I must say our waiter was very nice up to the point where he took us the check without offering us desert obviously rushing us out. we did not even finish eating before he took us our check. My husband asked if we could stay and listen to the band as he said he would not be rushed out for a service he is paying for. The waiter said ok but we could see he had to go explained to a lady why were not gone and she was obviously upset with him for not successfully ejecting us from our seat and the restaurant. we all sat in amazement watching them talk. After we left my friends stopped to use the bathroom and I sat at the front waiting and if I thought it was my imagination i knew for sure as one of the ladies at the front went in a room where she could face me squarely through a glass window and gave me a look that said it all. She stared at me good and hard to ensure I got the message. I was appalled at the level of racism that we experienced. It was not my imagination as I kept saying, no this is not happening but to give us a check before we finish eating and not offer us desert!!! That was horrible!!"

Apart from that, I had never entered a place where it felt as heavy as Carol's Place. The old waitresses are very serious, or at least serious for anyone who is not North American since several times I smiled with two of them and their response was disapproval and seriousness, but with my American friends it was all laughter. My waitress forgot to offer me coffee, she did not give me extra napkins until I asked for them, Really if you're not a North American person or if you're not blond, white with blue or green eyes you can breathe racism everywhere. I do not consider myself a selfconscious person at all, but it was very funny to enter and observe some disapproving looks from the diners and some old waitresses. While I waited for my food I could observe how some people sitting at a table near me commented on atrocities of some black people who were in front of me. If this restaurant does not have bad comments, I'm sure it could be because only North American people have commented that they have really had a good time understanding racism on the part of those in charge of Carol's place. As for breakfast, nothing bad. It is not the most exquisite thing on the planet but it is allowed to eat, except pancake that are horrible and tasteless. I really felt very disappointed that this still happens in the society in which we live, unfortunately I think that racism is something that can not be eradicated so easily from some societies. Personally I do not return to this place to eat, I really do not recommend it at all. It was debut and farewell."

I love to support places like this anywhere I go. I have been here in Carillon for a week and have gone to this narly little caf every single day for crappy coffee and sub standard faire. This afternoon I fed a party of thirteen in the pouring rain under their small umbrellas. I had the worst buffalo chicken salad on the planet. After that my kids and their friends went back on their bikes and ordered and paid for ice cream. While they were eating my son popped a stray water balloon that was sitting on a table. Then he left. Shortly after the owner came out and unloaded on his friend, who is darker skinned and told him the water balloon had special meaning and yelled and screamed. My poor 11 year old daughter was so frightened she offered the woman her last five dollar bill to help pay for the stupid balloon. She also apologized to her twice. I called this woman once I heard about this and the only thing she had to say was that she didn't yell but was unhappy about having to clean the ""mess"". water and a balloon. What she didn't mention to me was how she told her waitress ""not to serve those people"". Never again. The food is gross. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not up to code."

We are a biracial couple, my husband is African American and I am Hispanic. I am not discrediting anyone else's experience by any means, but we did not encounter that. In fact, through out our entire stay, that was one thing we really loved about St. Augustine. We felt it was very embracing. Our service at Llama was impeccable. The waiter was very knowledgeable and engaging. We had no idea Peruvian food was so internationally influenced. We DID make reservations. The restaurant is small and cozy. There was a bit of a wait between our courses but I appreciate that because it means our food was fresh. The ceviche was TO DIE FOR! This was the type of place that from appetizer to dessert, everything was top notch! Great place, great food! "

At the end of the day, we looked for a well reviewed restaurant on TripAdvisor and found the Llama Restaurant was well reviewed for special occasions. The visit was on a Thursday, about 5:30 pm. As soon as we entered, we were asked if we had a reservation as we saw two of the about 12 tables occupied. We said that we did not, and the female hostess/server said that she had to check for space. She returned from the back of the restaurant and informed us that we could sit at the bar for dinner. We inquired if all of the tables were reserved and she said that they all were. Our level and sense of discomfort was great and we had an uneasy feeling that we were not considered the appropriate types of customers there. We promptly left, the same as we entered but with the feeling that our slightly darker tone of Hispanic skin and heritage was not welcome here. We are not used to this type of treatment and felt it appropriate to share with others that may be interested. We welcome a response from the owner or manager."

The older man at the table next to me looked shocked and at first dropped his head. Then he looked up and told me, please dont start a ruckus. Just leave. Still in shock, we got up and walked out. Never in my wildest dreams would I ever have thought I would experience this here or anywhere else on St Pete Beach! Im 50 years old and have NEVER EVER been treated this way.

Never to comeback, for sure.","First time in this restaurant, treated like ""crab"" and never to comeback...for sure! We were attracted by the location and the fact that is one of Sebastian's oldest buildings. Ordered 2 fish and salad plates and pay 44 for it. The price seemed a little too high for the place, but we gave it a try. First ""formal"" restaurant we've been where you pay before you eat your meal... The portions of both, my husband and mine, fresh fish was like a kid's size nugget. And the salad consisted on a bunch of packed dry lettuce and a few small pieces of tomatoes, that's it... PLUS served on plastic plates with plastic utensils. We were shocked! I asked to talk to the manager or owner. We felt that what we were being served was not at all worth the price we payed for. He came to our table and in a very polite manner I explained our reasons for the discomfort and showed him what we were served. I gave him a comparison with a few similar places we are clients of in Miami. He said, ""oh yes, I shall be ashamed of myself for serving you this."" He took the plates and throw them in the trash. I went to the cashier to ask if we were going to get new plates or our money back By then were were feeling really uncomfortable and it was already a terrible experience. He gave us the money back and proceded to insult me not considering us as a firsttime customers, not considering other customers around, not considering us as human beings. Instead, he was very quick at saying ""you should be ashamed of yourself""  ""do you think these old white people ever complain about my food""  ""you Miami people... we don't like your kind, do not ever comeback to my restaurant."" And the door was slammed after we left. Well, that made it somewhat clear to us. We were shocked. Quietly returned to our car and realized we had been victims of racism by someone who is clearly in the wrong job, who has no sensitivity whatsoever and who is quick at bullying people, more so if you are LatinAmerican and European, like my husband and I. This gentleman should not be serving people. Period. Our lunch experience in Sebastian ended in Jalisco, a wellknow Mexican restaurant in town. Great service, good food and good atmosphere!"

This place is always packed so there is always a wait but last Dec. when some of my friends arrived late and sat at our table problems began. Now, this has happened before but the people were white or asian and no one said anything so I know it isnt the policy to disallow people from joining a table who arrive late. This was the first time some of my black friends were meeting me at Shoya and when they sat down the manager flipped out. I mean flipped out. You could hear him cursing at the front desk and screaming at the server.He refused to allow the server to take any more orders. We had to close out our tab, reenter the line, wait another 30 minutes before being allowed to sit and place an order. At the time I thought it was extremely strange and maybe racially motivated but my visit last night just sealed it.Other than myself everyone was a person of colour. There were 5 of us. The place was busy and we expected a wait. The boss was taking down names again, as we put our name on the list one of the waitresses looked over and said"" Oh, hell no!"" in our direction and walked off. I tried to ignore that and the boss said 30 minutes, so, we waited outside it was cold but we didnt mind and than we came in.When we checked in, he said oh it will be another 30 minutes or more and it would be best if we waited outside. He also said the wait was because the restaurant could not accommodate such a large party of 5 people it might be even longer wait. Than it sank in. This place had parties seated that were 8 plus, one party had 10 people and he didnt want us waiting inside the restaurant with other patrons. We also noticed our group was the only group at that time with people of colour in it. He was lying and he was never going to seat us. He was waiting for us to get frustrated and leave, which we did. It was very sad."

Once he did show up we still did not had any sauces in front of us and did i mention that the show cooking did not really happen because the chef was too busy socializing with one guy talking about subjects that make people uncomfortable Well mind your conversations at work please!

Oh when i ask the manager about our drinks he just brushed me off and waved at me like i am some type of fly, yes...not a paying customer but a parasite but i think the real issue was simply because my mother and boyfriend are Caucasian and no one else in the restaurant were...!On our final bill we also got charged 2 additional for rice! No other place out of the 25 other Hibachi places that i have been to charge for rice...its like charging for water but like i said..money hungry they are! The only thing that happened fast in that place was bringing us the check! REAL customer service would have been the manager coming to our table and apologizing for the wait and offering us anything to make us more welcomed but that did not happen at all. Also the bathrooms were dirty and not restocked!Bad customer service and racism does not sound too well so there is no need to go back to this location ever!"

I was there with my family that lives nearby and everything would of been great. But when middle son came in with his black wife and there son, it seemed like everything went quiet, maybe it was me but i did a scan of the restaurant and it seemed like all eyes were on us. We sat down and ordered our food. It seemed to take a little longer than i thought it would for our food to arrive, when our food was severed everyone but my middle son family got there food. We inquired to our server he said he put it in there system wrong. Although my daughter in law was getting upset rightfully so i was able to calm her down with the help of her son."

This is a neighborhood bar and grill where most people you could tell were regulars on an early Tuesday evening.Tried the wings and both my wife and I tried the burgers. Food was very good and prepared well.Problem here is the environment. Sitting at the table across from us were a small group of loud obvious racist, who kept using the ""N"" word and telling inappropriate racist jokes LOUDLY across to people at the bar. My wife and I are an interracial couple who have been married more than 25 years, and we were incredibly surprised that no one said anything. Obviously, I wanted to speak up but my wife just wanted to get out as quickly as possible. Again, if you are okay with a racist environment or perhaps even want one this is a good place to have a decent meal."

Another male Caucasian customer stated they ignored him as well and refused to take his and others orders also. We were forced to use a kiosk that was dirty and nasty. However, I observed when black customers approach the counter, the clerk quickly and cheerfully took their order. In addition, the clerk didn't give a receipt for my order. Upon requesting the front manager to get me a receipt, she did not know how to work the registers enough to supply one. As always I remained polite and told the manager I would not return to this location and they needed to ""get their act together"" and left to some applause from other customers sitting at a nearby table. The only positive highlights were my order was correct and observing the cook working hard and diligently to keep orders going out.From reading other reviews in Trip Advisor.com and Facebook, it appears this is an ongoing problem for approx. 3 years reviews from 5 yrs ago are mostly positive. I would definitely recommend traveling to another local McDonalds restaurant when in Ruston, LA."

We had dinner at a Japanese restaurant before we left Portland, Maine. The writing on the paper strip reads, Please pay tips as 15 to 18 of your cost. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you! It is in Chinese. We asked the waitress do they have the same paper strip printed in other languages, as well as to ask their manager to come. She signed, Uh! while leaving our table. The owner of the restaurant came. He explained that they printed these strips since some travelers dont know the culture of paying tips here. We said, Do you have the same paper strips in Japanese, Korean, French or Spanish, any other languages Please show us. He responded that the Japanese on the plate has the same meaning. We dont believe these five Japanese characters carry the same meaning. The owner said, If you dont want to pay tips, thats okay. You dont need to pay. We said, This is not the matter of money.I want to say that the owner talked gently to us from the beginning, and he apologized in the end. However, the waitress said, I hope you guys have a wonderful day. I dont want to serve people like you, when she returned the receipts for us to sign.I was pissed off. But later on, I feel sorry for the waitress who would be almost impossible to develop her empathy and mentality to understand why we were angry and why what they are doing is considered practicing racism. She viewed us as unreasonable and aggressive troublemakers.I experienced regionalism in Taiwan and Hong Kong. After Singapore, Korea, Malaysia, Cambodia, America, Peru, and Bolivia, finally, I experienced how racism is like, which, to some extent, is eyeopening. I never saw this kind of reminders in any restaurant in Boston, New York, and DC, the only cities I have been to in the states. I am a student who lives with a financial constraint. But I do pay tips. And I wont pay for racism."

My husband is Chinese so we stared at each in shock for a moment and then I went to speak to the manager. When she asked what she could do for me, I explained that, while I was sure this older man working as the magician was lovely to them I was worried he might have been some employee's father , he had just started a trick with the line, ""two chinese, two mexicans, and I..."" and I thought that the restaurant management would want to know about it. I assumed, wrongly it turns out, that a young woman from New England in this day, so soon after the Charlottesville incident, would be concerned about the casual racism but she wasn't at all. She told me the management had hired this magician, she had no say in it, and that this line was only part of a trick anyway. I asked if she could think of anything in a magic trick that would make his opening acceptable and she started repeating, ""what do you expect me to do about this"" over and over. She finally offered to move us but I told her that wasn't at all my point; that I was more concerned that the restaurant had hired someone who was making casual racist comments and didn't appear to care. At that point, I walked back to my table to finish my father's birthday dinner. Our brisk waitress suddenly disappeared and we waited 40 more minutes for any food. At no time did anyone on the staff approach us to express concern or apologise and we were charged the full amount for our dinner."

There was other customers but he seemed to be hovering over us the whole time. We were drinking our coffee , he looked down on us and told us very rudely you good to go  The reason we came back there is because it seemed like a good family place. Now we are leaving with a sour taste in our mouth. We are definitely never coming back. Its unfortunate that in a town where JF Kennedy who supported civil rights, there is still issues with racism 50 years later."

When I went to open the door I almost pulled my rotator cuff out. I could clearly see three employees inside the store and the store was not busy... there was no one at the drivethrough. I knocked on the door and asked why the store wasnt open. A very tall employee approach the door angrily and aggressively. Yelling at me saying that the dining room was closed. I said the sign on the door here says that you open at six and it is now after 730. She screamed me that they didnt have enough people open the dining room and that time!and that when more people show up theyll open the doors. I was then told to take my white a to the drivethrough! This type of blatant racism is demeaning and unacceptable!.... we went to another Tim Hortons restaurant a short distance away at mound Road and 12 mile road...... they were only two employees there and they were very busy.... but the dining room was open!... The demographics there were so much better!..and so was service! They were really nice and went out of their wayMake my girls coffee better!.... I explain my situation they told me they had received many complaints about the other store location in the past!!.....Avoid the Van Dyke Location!.

We ordered drinks and food and had just begun to eat when the manager walked over to us and put our bill inside a glass, and sat it down in front of us and walked away. The restaurant was full and from our observation no one else was given their bill inside a glass as they were still eating. The assumption by us was that we were to leave as soon as we were done eating. My husband was the only minority eating in the establishment at the time, which also made us wonder if we were getting targeted for being a minority family. Josephs is known for really good pie, which we were planning on ordering as well but we were not even given the option. The bar tender apologized for the rudeness displayed by the manager. My husband asked to speak to the manager and moved him into the lobby so that he was respectful of the other patrons. My husband voiced his concern to the manager and the manager began yelling at him, stating he gives the bill like that to all patrons, which as we observed was not true. The manager on his own without being questioned about racism stated, Im not a racist, but obviously that was a driving force behind his action to give us our bill while we were still eating or else he would have never jumped to that conclusion. The manager knew what he did was wrong, and his unprovoked denouncing of not being a racist was evidence of his true feeling that he didnt want us in his establishment."

I've never been to a restaurant where old school racism and classism was so apparent. Not having experienced anything like this in 30 years, I had apparently erroneously believed that St. Louis had become more progressive than this. But the treatment received at John Mineos clearly suggests otherwise. Not only was the behavior of the manager on duty bad, but in providing feedback to the owner's son, John Jr., it was clear that the manager's behavior was condoned. This is my first online review, but felt this was particularly warranted. It is places like this that give St. Louis a bad reputation. I will never patronize this establishment again.

In either case, when I called that afternoon to speak to a manager, she told me that she was a manager. When I asked her why she kicked my son out of the restaurant, she denied his story.Manager on Duty: Kayla, the one with blue hairSum: What was supposed to be a treat, a nice distraction, from his greatgrandmother in the hospital became a sad reminder of the state of this country today.Details: On Tuesday, November 20, 2018, my Grandmother was taken for tests directly before noon. We used navigation to find a place where there was a great deal of fast food to distract the boys. My 12yearold was given a 10 bill and we said we would circle around to get him after the rest of us went through drive through.  When we made it through Taco Bell then the Steak and Shake, we circled back to pick up our straight A, son to discover that he wasnt given a treat at all, but a life lesson on how people can be less than decent to others. I walked in and asked for a menu so I could see the toppings. The lady behind the counter said that they did not have a menu. I ended up just adding pepperoni because I was embarrassed to keep asking. But before she put my pizza in the oven, another person walked in with a baby. She spoke with that person and just let my pizza sit there. When the person left, she put my pizza in oven. When the pizza came out, she said, Bye, you can go now; I have other customers.  My son was shocked and left the restaurant as instructed. He is used to listening to adults. But, when he got in the car, he told me that a blue haired woman named Kayla told him to leave the restaurant because she had other customers even though there were not other customers in the restaurant. There was a small table and two chairs that could be seen from the window where he could have sat until we returned. He ended up going inside the door briefly because he was getting cold but then we came to get him.  When this story was told in the hospital, I promptly called the store. I asked to speak to the manager. Kayla said that she was the manager. I stated that my son said that he was asked to leave the restaurant. She stated that she was the only one that had been in the restaurant all day and that this did not happen. This didnt make sense; this 12 year old had no reason for creating this story nor was this fun or a getoutoftrouble story. This was just sad."

My husband explained the mistake to the owner and instead of apologizing for the mistake and maybe saying a child shouldn't be given the task of using a credit card machine, she was rude. She eventually reversed the charges and we paid in cash, but their mistake tied up our money for 24 hours. They were not authorized to charge that amount to our account. 3. Food was mediocre. 4.

A neat old diner that opens early, closes in the afternoon. We have had many good burgers and hot turkey sandwiches here. One of the waitresses here has always been friendly and a great server. One of the other waitresses...not. And I think the owner needs to learn to smile. Today we walked in at 1:40 p.m.. Closing time is 2:00 p.m.. There were four or five tables with people in various stages of their meal. Hubby asked as we walked in, ""Are we coming in too late"". The good waitress says, ""Oh No, come on in!"". We quickly ordered, since we know what we wanted, and had only water to drink. As we sat there, one or two tables finished and left. I saw two meals come out of the kitchen and delivered to a couple of men. At about three minutes to 2:00 they went over and flipped the open to closed on the door. Our lunch got delivered, and I had to ask for a couple of condiments that usually get delivered to your table on an order of ""hamburgers"" They got delivered to the table, no one asked if we wanted more water...or if our lunch was ok. Now get this...they started vacuuming with a LOUD vacuum. Nice touch to us starting our sandwiches! Then when she stopped vacuuming to go into the back for something, an older man, who was either a coowner or waiting for one of the workers to get off work, let out a racist rant on jay walkers! Something about so many of them get ran over because they look just like a shadow! No kidding, we are eating our lunch, and this guy just let it out! Then the waitress came back and started up old faithful and the noise started up again! We were gulping our food down this whole time, as we felt pressured to get done. Again, no one asked how are meal was, or if they could get us anything else. When we got up to pay, with cash the waitress said the cash register was taken into the back, and went back to get our change. We left feeling like we were unwanted guests, got horrible service, and were very upset about the racist joke that was told. I feel like NEVER going back, and will not recommend this place any more. The main thing here is this; We ASKED if we were coming in too late. Twenty minutes before they were to close. THEY said come on in. The vacuum should have not been ran while we were eating, the racist needs to shut his mouth, and the waitress needs to do her job, and serve us like customers...not intruders."

I am in the diner, writing this review. That's how bad it is.My hubby and I heard about the great food at this diner.. and the fact that this was the spot that the locals hung out.We stepped in the door, and that was the first problem. The, 'locals' were STARRING at us, as if we were a science experiment! As we stood there waiting to be seated, several waitresses, buzzed by us. Finally, a woman quickly, 'cleaned' a table. She walked by us saying, ""You can sit there.."" and pointed to the table. Which still has sticky stuff on it.As we made our way to the table, in this tiny, box of a restaurant, the locals never took their eyes off of us! Trying to make it uncomfortable for us. Every move we made, all eyes were on us. I was afraid to order anything like eggs or bacon, thinking that they may do something to our food, and advised my husband to get something that was like, bread or pancakes. We didn't drink the water, and ordered pancakes and potatoes. Overall, the food was okay, and our waitress, who incedently, tried to be nice, was probably the kindest one there. It took Ages to get our food, and seconds to get the check. If you are visiting the Bedford PA area, and you are a race, other than Caucasian, do yourself a favor, eat somewhere else. Unless, you enjoy feeling as if you are back in the 1950's1960's and may get food and drinks thrown on you. Seriously.Thankfully, we just paid. We're out of here! Yay!!"

I was hesitant after my mother in law made reservations to go here after reading reviews but decided to see for myself. The evening started off with them misplacing our reservation so we had to wait while they prepared a table for us. After that it was all down hill. we had a server that had no idea what she was doing, didn't offer us any specials or. cocktails. It took us 15 minutes to receive our drinks and another 20 for our apps. half of the table entrees were cold and my father in laws steak was prepared well done after he requested medium rare. the whole time we were swatting away flies. very Unappetizing. We ended up boxing our food and weren't even offered desserts. to put the cherry on top of a horrible evening the bathrooms were horrendous. I heard a guest at the bar commenting about them to who I assume is a manager who replied,"" that was the Asians that were here earlier, I will find a server assistant to take care of it."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME! what kind of manager says something like that about their guests, and TO a guest. Completely unprofessional and racist. Furthermore if she had any inclination that the bathrooms needed cleaning she is more than capable of taking care of them herself. I am offended and completely disappointed.

This was the most rudest and unprofessional thing anyone has ever said to me in the food industry! Was it because he is just a mean , overwhelmed jerk or because he didn't like the mixed couple , us, or the waitress that was of color as well or what was it That we didn't think you ranting about your coworkers was fun He ignored us afterwards.... it took a very long time to get food and even people who came behind us had food already .

If it was not for a hungry child I would have left. Food was mediocre. I am a nurse and I do not like shrimp and was not asked about allergies in which I had a small child. Children are prone to food allergies from shell fish. The cook cooked the vegetables with the ship again but never asked about seafood allergies. Reckless of a restaurant not to ask.

My fiance knew I loved to sing so he decided to take me to karoake on Friday evening. The location was easy to spot and parking was only 5 dollars which was fine. As we approached the building, the bouncer stated id and it would be 5 dollar to get in. As we were both getting our id, the bouncee asked my fiance to pull his shirt up. We were just thinking maybe he didnt want to frisk him. My fiance complied and did what he asked for. Then the guy stated since his pants were pulled down slightly below from his waist that he wasnt allowed to go in. Now mind you, their several other males with their pants not properly placed on his hip. He was utterly rude and I have never seen such hypocrisy in my life. The sad thing this is when I went to another bar the bartender which is a Caucasian lady asked me where did my fiance and I come from I told her what occurred. She stated she wasnt shocked bc it happened to one of her girlfriend. Apparently she was wearing tights and wasnt permitted to come in but yet a young Caucasian lady after her was wearing the same attire and she was capable of going in. So long story short, this place has racism still going on. Sadly, this is a way to loose customers."

We were beyond disappointed, to the point where we split the bill and I'm having my birthday meal elsewhere! By far the worst thing about the restaurant is Nick. Within five minutes he had managed to alienate us both with several sexist comments and some offensive language. He gave us two menus, dinner and 'comfort/light supper' and we went to the garden for a drink and to decide whether we actually wanted to eat here or not. It was a special occasion so we persevered. I ordered from the expensive dinner menu, my partner ordered fish pie from the other menu still 18. At this point Nick said 'oh, you've gone for the Jewish option', which we can only interpret at a serious racial slur about ordering from the 'cheap' menu. This is not ok, Nick. So perhaps we were sickened to the point of losing our appetite, but the food itself was woefully average and massively overpriced. My hake was completely tasteless, rubbery and overcooked; everything was bland and unseasoned, with no freshness or flair whatsoever. Very disappointing given the price. Our meal was rudely interrupted by Nick, who banged loudly on the back of the pew we were seated at. Think of an overexcited Nigel Farage as an especially unfunny Basil Faulty, serving tea in a care home and you'll get the picture. We will never, ever go back, not even for the dessert, which was the one and only impressive aspect of the entire ordeal."

The skin looked and felt like it still raw those spots. I told Clairen, the bartender, they were not done and asked if they could be cooked longer. She apologized and took them back. My wings came back and I was prepared to enjoy. However, the first wing I opened was extensively pink inside not just next to the bone. I again informed Clairen the wings were not done and showed her the pink wing. She apologized and said she would have them prepared again while I continued to eat my cheesesticks. Turns out only the two wings with the white spots were recooked from the first order. While waiting for the correction, a man whom I assumed to be a manager came over to me, but instead of apologizing for the problems he proceeded to tell me that wings being pink inside are normal and not an indication of rawness but how wings are. I pointed to the wings showing him the pink meat, the soft, wet skin and the toughness of uncooked meat and told him no fried wing that was done would present like this. He continued to explain and I asked him to just cook my wings longer. Instead of him following my request he continued to lecture me about wings, calling me ""girl"" at various points, and telling me I didn't have the Christmas spirit. I asked him to quit explaining to me and just bring me wings that were done. I informed him I was offended by him calling me a girl as I am a grown woman and asked him to quit calling me girl. He continued to repeat himself about the wings and tell me I had the wrong spirit. I asked him to just bring me wings that were done whatever he needed to do to them. He continued to repeat himself about wings being pink. At that point, I asked him to quit talking to me because I came here to relax with wings and a drink, asked him to bring me an order of wings that were done, told him I would no longer engage with him and turned away from him to reengage in the game I was watching. He continued to stand over me lecturing me about wings, antagonized me about ""my spirit"" and canceled/refused to place my order since I would no longer engage with him. As a Black woman, I am very familiar with individual acts of racism like this one, and I am more than disappointed with his blatant racist behavior. Even the White patrons next to me at the bar sat with their mouth gaping open at his behavior. but did not step in to say anything about his behavior Some say I should have expected it knowing I was the only Black person in the restaurant besides the waitress Kim and knowing the culture of Round Rock, but I guess my hope for an antiracist world keeps me engaging. I still have hope but I will no longer patronize The Rock Sports Bar and will encourage my multiracial friends and colleagues to not spend their money there either until The Rock intentionally works to become an antiracist organization."

I was there just today. The wings were perfect. As was the service. On most of the TVs was The Masters. Everybody in there cheered when Tiger won. Everybody. Sad how in the post Obama era people are still finding racists under every rock. A couple of things cool about Tiger's win. He won The Masters once again. That club until recently did not allow minorities to play there. Today a multiculteral man won it yet again, and dare I say, had a white caddy. Oh my. What would really top it off is if Tiger has one of those white jockeys on the side of his driveway. Cheers to Tiger and The Ice House. Jeers to those who choose to see racism in every situation when they are slighted. Sad since as a demographic black people rarely tip over 10, if at all. There, someone said it."

She simply walked by us time after time and ignored us. Stood at the bar doing nothing and continued to ignore us. After 10 minutes of waiting we left which I'm assuming was what she wanted anyway. I have a friend who goes there all the time who gets served promptly but if this particular waitress doesn't know who you are or your not a hot guy or not in a group you won't be served if she's waiting tables. For the persons who thought it was racism I can understand why you would think that I would too if I were you but that likely has nothing to do with it because she does the same thing to us white folks. It's the same girl  treatment many others have been complaining about on FB  Trip Advisor. She's just a horrible waitress with a bad attitude and should be replaced or hidden in the back away from the customers. Bottom line, she doesn't care if you or I come in or not. I don't know if she's part of ownership, management or related to them but she should definitely NOT be a waitress. I won't go back there again  always encourage the group to go somewhere else when it comes up. It's such a tiny little place they really don't care if there is only a handful of people in there anyway and clearly she doesn't need the customers or money. And when you are being ignored....everyone see's it because it's such a small place. It's embarrassing once you figure out you are not wanted there  therefore will get no service from her. Life's too short to support people/businesses like that. Moving on."

But yesterday 12/17/2016 I had a racist discrimination by a female white waiter. The male waiter was a true gentleman. He served us with class but at around 11:30 pm only the female waiter was left. She was not that busy but she never cared to serve us. So we decided to pay our bill and leave. Everyone else got a waiter wallet but she just dropped a paper bill on us. Despite this I tipped 20. But the waiter never picked up our final receipt which was right there but picked up the wallets of everyone else. I could see her looking at the receipt. Finally, I had enough, I took the receipt with me so she missed her 5 tip. If you have issues serving people of color, choose another career where you can a choice. Don't bring your ignorance to work. This the last time am visiting this Ice house... there are other restaurant I can choose from."

She waited a long time to even have her order taken we were eating by the time she gave her order and she was seated before us. Same treatment continued with her food not turning up for about 30 minutes then not been cleared away then she had to ask 3 times for bill. Eventually she went to the till where the waitress was on her mobile. This lady was black African and in our opinion dealt with this treatment with great dignity. It's is irrelevant to comment on the food or environment because these were completely overshadowed by the racism we witnessed we will not eat here again and advise anyone who reads this to do the same

Avoid! Avoid!OMG!!!!!!!! Plain racism in this Pub/Resturant. Female Staff will not have eye to eye contact with my wife and myself. Twice she browses over my shoulder and ask others if they were served and while totally snubbing us. We got off the queue in shock and walked away from the restaurant. At the exit, we bumped into my motherinlaw that was supposed to meet us for lunch. We told her our horrible treatment at the queue but she said that we couldn't walk away and that we must confront them about their behaviour. We went back and asked for the manager but when we told her about our treatment, she didn't even listen to our complaint and just jumped and said that her the manager was married to a Black Man and no one was racist in her Pub. So a word of advice, as for myself, I will never set my foot in that routine place. Because the manager herself is a racist for backing racism of her own staff. Its a shame really to see such a thing in a close community.Ps. Yes and this was probably our 15th visit in the place, cause we've been going there for over a year. And as for this racist female staff, this was the first time I've ever seen her on the counter serving people but that not the point here! My point is the way the manager handled the situation and condoned racism!"

My hamburger steak was good, mashed potatoes fine, biscuits and cornbread nice, and the green beans had so much bacon fat in them that they couldn't help being delicious my guess about the bacon fat  I could be wrong.....This is homestyle cooking without any attention to health, so overall tasty, but left me feeling like I shouldn't eat anything else for days. Our waiter was very pleasant and prompt with some things, but not with others. The two people who brought our food did not know which of our meals was medium rare vs well done, so they guessed and got it wrong. It was awkward to switch partway through the meal, so neither of us got what we'd actually wanted. This was my first Cracker Barrel experience, but we were with some locals who indicated this was not the best one they have been to. I posted a picture to FaceBook and had a friend suggest I check some news stories. I quickly found stories throughout the chains of racism, sexism and political support of very conservative causes that infringe on basic human rights. So, their gift store got none of my money despite some cute selections and I will not be going back. This location is very close to a number of motels and food options. If you don't mind the politics and fairly heavy food, it's not a bad choice, but there are other options available."

The staff is really friendly but the owner who is really rude and racist. The owner was the cooker the day we visit the restaurant and he refused to served my meal in a plate because base on his judgment my bowl have too much food and instead of serve it in a plate like they do to everybody else, he served it on a box to go. I usually get one bowl and share it with my girlfriend witch is enough for both of us. Is not the first time we fill up the plate like many other customers who put as much as possible on a single bowl, I even had seen people taking mountains of food wich its fine because you can put as much as you can in a bowl but in this case, I believe base on racism the owner scolded me saying that I took too much food and he wont serve it in a plate and to end up the bad experience he told me if two people want to eat you have to pay for two plates no for one. He burned almost half of the noodles on the grill so we dont get all the noodles we got on our bowl. After me other customers got similar bowls but most of them were white people and Asians, I am Hispanic and I believe thats why he acted that way. Is a shame because we like to come here but no anymore. Really bad experience."

I'm a 66 and my father is 90. We're both caucasian which should not have anything to do with a restaurant review, but unfortunately, it does. We entered this Dennys restaurant around 10:30 a.m. on Sunday morning, August 26, 2018. The place was over half empty with at least a dozen open tables. I told the hostess that we'd like a table for 2. I was told there was a 45 minute wait for a table. When I asked why, I told that the kitchen was behind and that we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table. So we left to find a different place to eat. While I was looking for a different restaurant on my cell phone, another couple went into the restaurant. Evidently there was seating for them, but not for us. I should add that the hostess and visible employees were African Americans as were the couple that entered the restaurant after us and were seated.

When I was told that I couldn't be served the first time due to an equipment failure, I innocently took it at face value.70 full. Sign in, and wait to be seated...15 minutes pass, without so much as an acknowledgement that we exist. Had the restaurant been busy, or even just large, I could understand. Had it been understaffed, again, I could understand. Instead, we were treated like we were invisible. There were about 15 customers, and at least 5 staff in the front of house. We didn't receive so much as a glance.I now understand how it felt to be black during segregation. They really need a ""No Whites Served Here"" sign. As a long time resident of Hawaii, I have experienced racism against Caucasians occasionally. Never as blatant as it was here, however. To act as if we don't even exist To refuse to seat us, with empty tables everywhere The Filipino family that came in after we had been ignored for 15 minutes was greeted warmly, and it was only then that I realized what was actually happening. I had assumed that most people in society at least attempt to hide their racism. And I've never experienced it from an entire business before, but there was no denying what happened.As we left, I made sure to thank the staff. Loudly. Repeatedly. From the front of the restaurant. Every one of the customers heard me, of that I'm sure. Not one staff member, even those within 10 feet of me, even turned their head to acknowledge my simple ""thank you!"".If you are Filipino, you may enjoy this restaurant. I will never know, nor will any of the visitors that I entertain.If you want to know what racism really feels like, if you don't understand the term ""white privilege"", I recommend this place. It is enlightening. A great reminder of the sickness that is racism.If you are just looking for a meal, there are places all over this island, Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, that will gladly show you the respect that every human being deserves. I would suggest trying them.I normally avoid leaving bad reviews for a place that I only visit one time. I like to give the benefit of the doubt. The cook may have called in sick, equipment may have broken down, there are myriad reasons why a restaurant can have an off night. So, I have reserved my one and only negative review on TripAdvisor for a blatantly racist establishment that I will make sure all my friends, Filipinos included, know about."

At some point these types of reviews will outweigh the positive reviews  which this establishment does not deserve. Despite having a diner in the facility who had just been served, the doors being unlocked and the place looked open. I was told in a very condescending manner the restaurant was closed. Hours on the door stated they closed at 10...it was 9:58, so I thought I would see if I could get a quick to go order. Nowhere do it say last seating at ""x"" time or kitchen closes at ""x"" which leads me to believe you are fully open up and until the closing time. And given that they would have to wait at least the 20 minutes for those sitting down eating to finish before close  they could have at least considered a to go order. The kicker was the racist/classist manager who assumed, that I as Black woman was looking for a handout. When I asked her if I could get a quick to go order  her response was we don't have any soup...umm, huh I'm done."

When a young black male was seated at the counter next to my daughter and myself, he was left seated waiting for a menu for over 15 minutes while servers continued to walk past him and ignore him. This was unlike the prompt service that I received. When the young man then walked up to the cash register to directly request a receipt he was finally handed a menu. Thereafter he again sat unattended for another 15 minutes while all servers ignored him at the counter and never offered to take his order. This was again unlike the prompt service I received sitting right next to him at the counter. The young man then politely asked the manager whether all the servers went on break at the same time and she brusquely replied that everyone was busy and he would have to wait despite all the servers walking right past him at the counter and their attentive service to me and my daughter sitting right next to him. After receiving the clear message that his patronage was not welcome the young man left. So despite the good service my daughter and I received I left with a terrible experience at IHOP. Since then I searched the web and have found that there is a pattern of complaints of biased customer service. Clearly the IHOP employees and franchisees need more training on the laws of equal treatment. I strongly suggest that IHOP mandate implicit bias training to create greater awareness https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/aboutus.html. Until things change I cannot in good conscience recommend IHOP to anyone."

The rooftop was recently renovated. There is a 30 cover charge that is not worth the price. Cmon this rooftop lacks the vibe found in Vegas or Miami and I have never paid a cover at those locations.The servers are very pleasant but lack the fundamental skills in, wellbeing a server. Too long to greet after being seated, too long to deliver drinks, too disorganized, and they cant be found when you are ready to close out. Now, lets move on to what led me to write this review. I will start with a quote from a comedian on SNL about Boston the most racist city Ive ever been to, this was not unfounded during my interaction with an employee of the Revere Rooftop. It began with a brash communication from an unidentified manno uniform, no name tagabout being in reserve seats although there was no sign and the hostess said the seating is first come/first serve when asked. This man then said we could continue to sit for a time. During our second encounter, he said that the party arrived and was harsher than before with unnecessary comments. When I asked if he worked for the hotel or if he was a promoter, just to have clarification, the man became aggressive in approach and tone by saying do you have a problem with how I am handling thingsWith that response, I did not want to escalate the situation so I decided it was best to remain quiet, close our tab and avoid communication with this individual. Unfortunately, he didnt stop thereThis man approached us four more times and in one instance pointed to my husband and said he lied to me  about the hostess saying it was first come/first serve. The statement was unprofessional, unnecessary and lacked simple logicI mean really who would lie about something so trivial especially when we asked to close out after our second abrasive encounter with him. It was clear that this person felt comfortable being disrespectful to customers and felt comfortable being disrespectful to AfricanAmericans. Oh and I neglected to mention, there were two separate parties sitting in the other reserved seat, which would round out the three reserved spots that he mentioned to us. The other patrons were not addressed at all by this man.Despite Bostons negative reputation, I honestly did not expect to have such an experience at what should be an upscale hotel venue. Too bad."

I asked for two menus but he mocked me this table is busy, move He said it in a really rude tone so I said Im sorry, I asked two waiters and they say it was fine I dont care, move, I need you to moveNow, I didnt have any problem waiting in line or anything, like I say the place is amazing, but the way he as asking and the tone he was using was just really rude and mean.I try to tell him again that it wasnt my intention to cause trouble but I got kinda nervous and I started to have trouble with my english and my accent, so I was trying to make a coherent phrase when he laughed.By this point I wasnt at the table anymore and as I tried to speak he kept stopping me and repeating that the table was occupied, that he had like 20 people waiting and I just couldnt get there and sit. Like I said, he also started to laugh as I struggled to explain and just had this mocking expression, as if he didnt understand me.My friend came and she asked if there was a problem, I told her what was going on and the guy went away. I basically spend the visit crying in the bathroom and then crying as I we waited the food to go, i dont remember who told me he was the manager or someone like that he wasnt a waiter, but then when he tried to talk to me again I called him out, I told him that I made a mistake and that he didnt have any right to treat me that way, but he just kept the mocking face.It really sucks that someone can give you such and awful experience and the fact that I still remember it crystal clear months after.Like I say, I love the place, the food is amazing and Ill definitely be back, i just hate the fact that they dont have a better costumer service. By the way, Im from mexico but Im writing this in english because I can write it and speak it very well, in it with a few minor mistakes, and if you can understand me so could he. "

Minorities beware.,"Prejudice, downright viciousness. This is the first review I've ever felt I needed to write  but Clark's is quite deliberately responsible for one of the sadder moments I can remember in New York:I've come to Clark's most weeks for years, sometimes three times per week. Yesterday, I came in about 10:45, ordered a coffee and a bagel, waited for a friend. When he came  a Hasidic guy, in traditional Jewish clothing  he ordered a coffee. They brought the check without bringing his coffee, though we hadn't said we were leaving. It was under the 10 minimum  something like 7. I left 13 and we asked again for the second coffee.It was about 12:30. The owner/manager comes back immediately enraged, no diplomacy, no attempt to speak to us as people, shouting ""you've been here since nine in the morning."" He ignored me every time I asked him why he would say that, so deliberately, so confidently, when he saw me come in just before 11. He tells us my friend needs to order more. I say that he keeps kosher, and that's all he can eat. The man says: ""Then this isn't the place for you.""He said: ""you are an embarrassment."" Because I left a 100 tip on a small bill Or because of our ethnicities  mine far more ""passing"", my friend's far more obvious I should say: the place was 2/3 empty the entire time we were there, perhaps halffull at the max. This place is an embarrassment. A place that hides old fashioned racism under the more fashionable prejudice, that a person is only ""worth"" what they spend on a given day. Sure, they forgot how much I really have given them, how often I've eaten their stale toast and cardboard eggs just to be in ""blastfromthepast"" New York.

We've been having side eyes all evening long not only from the waitresses who were acting as if we were non existent and some customers who looked like this was the first time ever for them to see a black person. The service was despicable  not only did they lack professionalism they were also very disrespectful: when paying we've asked the waitress to spill the bill as we were two persons, she's been looking at me as if I had insulted her mom.

There has always been some tension between Japanese and Chinese cultures, but I was surprised to see the racism that occurred this week. We went with a group of friends, all of whom were white I myself am middle eastern and we were so excited to experience this restaurant for our friend's birthday as we are sushi buffs. Our waitress Emma took all our orders, brought back drinks for everyone, but conveniently forgot my husband's ginger beer we didn't think much of it, figuring she was just busy or something. However, everyone at the table ordered their sushi, including us. We ordered the Love Boat for two, and our waitress wrote down the order in front of us. As the food for everyone else came out, she assured us that our food was on its way. After half an hour, I tried to say ""Excuse Me"" as she walked by, but I was ignored by her. Afterwards, we flagged her down and she said ""Oh you never ordered anything!"". Kind of ridiculous when we had been told our order was on its way and everyone at our table heard her say it. She asked us if we still wanted the order and we said yes. The sushi was ok, but not incredible and at first she wanted to put it into bowls instead of on the boat. We still tipped about 10, but it was terrible to be discriminated against in this manner due to me and my husband's skin tone when EVERYONE else in the restaurant had received their food except us. Absolutely heartbreaking to experience this in 21st century in a city as diverse as Atlanta."

I personally disliked his recommendation of the ""amazing"" Jack Sparrow drink, but if you like sour drinks, it might be preferable. Our total bill was 28 and we paid with a 50 bill to break it. A different server took our bill and returned with our change. As we checked the change, we realized that the server had shortchanged us by 2. We tried to call the servers again, who at that point they had their backs to us, intentionally avoiding us. Eventually, I had to get up to confront them about the discrepancy. Our original server looked visibily disgruntled at the server who had shortchanged us. They finally handed over the right amount and we left without leaving a tip.

I mean if they treated the foreigners with the same manner equally as they treated us like checking their ID as well for that matter, we would not be this mad. I mean, how shallow can you be If you want to have an exclusive club reserved for ONLY FOREIGNERS, you might as well told us so.

Nevertheless less the bartenders have a great attitude of not listening to you or serving what you want . Don't expect fancy cocktails . The Food : extremely undercooked or overcooked . Not too much of a food joint it is . The Evening : We walked into the fancy restaurant , much to our delight there was no cover charge and the lady at the front with the bouncers were very polite to let enter. The great ambiance and the wonderful setup looked as if we were surely in some spanish era. There wasn't much crowd , mostly groups and they were scattered everywhere . The DJ was playing Top40 . We were seated with a couple of beers for myself and a drink for my lady in a seating outside when a waiter/ server came and very rudely asked my wife and myself to leave the table for a group of 4 . This was quite the unexpected and since then everything feeling started going downhill . we walked to the bar counter and waited to order , the bartender looked at us a few times but didn't come to take our order ... i took an IDR50000 and placed it in the TIP box , making myself sure to be seen by the bartender , who zoom past the other customers and came to take my order . This surely shows the mentality of people and how they look at you . Its not just the skin but the thickness of the wallets that they look at . Unlike other clubs that we have visited in our 45 trips to bali this year ."

I came here one night with my friend and joined the line to get inside. Some people in front of me were just allowed in, but the first thing they asked was ""do you have reservation Invitation"" too many private parties that im not invited to, but my cousin and her husband were already inside. I went to party with my cousin but they didn't let me in because i'm a local. Smh. They let my cousin in because she was with her canadian husband. They always change the rules, only recently had a set of rules written downBasically, if you're local, dont even bother. Staff were super rude, security thugs always pointing flashlights to your eye as if you're a criminal. Don't get me started on the hosts, super rude and uneducated. This is by far the worst treatment i had. I know you guys arent gonna change up, so why even bother coming back :"

While we are getting them out he rudely says 'yeah come on we are all waiting' and shoved us out of the line  literally! We were so shocked. He was insanely rude, have never been treated like that in my entire life. We left and came back half an hour later waved us straight through and didn't ask for ID. However stopped my boyfriend and looked him up and down judging what he was wearing, he had been surfing all day however looked nice! we were 4 nicely dressed, not drunk, considerate Australians, I simply wanted to show my boyfriend the cool place we were on Wednesday night, what a joke. I certainly see why everyone says this place is racist as we were let in infront of locals  which I felt terrible about  never OK! We left within 10 minutes. If your not drunk and willing to spend 1520 per cocktail its really not worth it at all. The front door guy needs a serious attitude check."

This is not a onetime incident by any means.I went on Saturday with a few friends, a mixed group of foreigners and Indonesians. It was still early when we arrived, around 10pm, so there wasn't a line yet. However, security still looked us up and down, counted how many of us were foreigners 3 foreign, but only 2 with white skin, and 3 Indonesians then asked us if we were planning to buy a bottle. We said no, but that we were planning on drinking. We were allowed inside. 1 hour later 2 other friends of ours arrived. 1 Indonesian and 1 foreigner, however, they both are brownskinned. There was a line at this point so they waited and when they got to the front they were told they could not enter. First they were told it was because they were wearing sandals. Then they were told it was because they were not going to buy a bottle. Then they were asked where they were from and if they could speak English or Indonesian as if that matters. Two of us who were already inside the white foreigners went out to speak with security. We were told first it was about not buying a bottle, but we pointed out that we also did not buy a bottle and were allowed in. Also, surely not all of the people in line 100 were buying bottles, nor were they being asked. At this point my friends said they would just buy a bottle. Then the security's excuse was about the sandals again. I pointed out again, I was wearing sandals and almost every person in line was wearing sandals. Then we got silence from security and a 'sorry' head nod. After talking with 45 different security and complaining over and over that there was no valid reason for this they finally decided to let my friends in, but acted as if they were doing them a huge favor. It should be noted that we made a point to protest them in front of all the guests in line instead of quietly on the side like they wanted us to, and I suspect this is why they finally agreed, just for their image.Before and during this whole situation I saw multiple other Indonesian people getting the same treatment. Many were denied entry and told it was about buying bottles, their clothes, or given no reason at all. Meanwhile, every white foreigner in line was allowed in, no questions asked. The owners, LA FAMILIA GROUP, also own La Plancha, La Sicilia, La Laguna, and La Brisa in Bali. Avoid them all!"

The local bouncer asked me the popular query which if I had table reserved or not but before it's answered the foreign bouncer give us code with his hand saying ""just get in"", and suddenly reservation wasn't an issue anymore. It left us with question of what is exactly their door policyIs it just depends on the mood or whatSpeaking about quality of the place, I didnt feel the same vibe like what i've ever experienced 2 years ago. Music is not getting better, dj played more today's music than 90s hiphop or another old school playlist that I think makes this place even more attractive and unique in the beginning. The place is getting crowded with reckless drunken youngster and annoying bartenders that mocking my order, wtf. With racial issue and poor quality they have now, I sense they might couldnt keep their popularity for the next few years. Hopefully they can fix and well managed all of the issues received and not just ignoring and be too confident."

The club not really comfortable, especially for Indonesian have to show ID Card but no need for out of Indonesia, maybe they believe the others already over 21 years old.

I am Indonesian and my boyfriend and his sister are dutch. So my boyfriend and his sister went inside first i was following behind, but then suddenly the bouncer stopped me and asked for my id. I was confused at first and asked, ""umm id"" and he was also looked confused probably because he probably thought i was not Indonesian. So he asked again ""where are you from"" and i quickly thought it is probably because they're racist and usually don't let Indonesian enter i have no idea what is the reason up until now, So i answered, ""umm Japan!"".

Fine, so we stood outside for a while to think of the next place to go. While waiting we realized that she was only checking the IDs of asians. We asked her why didn't she check the ID for everyone and she just gave us a smug smile and ignored us. We honestly didn't get it because we just wanted to have a good night out, after having heard such nice things about La Favela, and we would have been okay if she had been fair in her screening but she wasn't. Bali is such a beautiful place with genuine people but it's a shame that our experience had to be marred by one racist individual at La Favela."

They will prevent them to enter and making stupid excuse while the westerner could enter it freely. Yikes!! I hate colonialism in my country, it's long gone. I would like to call their action as racism which blend perfectly with colonialism as they are making business, making money, hire Indonesian to work with them but how come they treat us that way. This is the worst treat that me and my friends ever get from a night club.price for the drinks actually is ok and it's standard price in Seminyak but they serve it with plastic glass. and despite their racism, I had dinner 2 times in here, the service was not great at all. I strongly not recommend this place, especially for Indonesian as they will treat you in bad way. Guys, just spend your money and energy in another better place."

The place itself is fab, the location, decor and vibe as long as its before 9pm. This is the key point. If you go during the day/early evening its a wonderful place, if you go later in the evening it's terrible!!!During the day, the staff are friendly and attentive, the food is good and the drinks great. If i was rating it before 9pm it would be 5 out of 5. If you go after 9pm its a 0 out of 5. La Favela turns from a magical venue into a sess pit of curruption, racism, hookers, dodgy security and useless staff. One night we witnessed a group of 5 mid 20 something Australia girls, who were sat at an unreserved table just chatting, forcebly and rudely asked to vacate the table so a slutty looking local girl with an entourage of hangers on could sit there because it was 'reserved'. After a few minutes of discussions the girls had to get up and leave. The security guard then put the reserved sign on our table, whilst we were sat there and after 15 minutes asked us to move as it was 'reserved'. i told him that he had put the sign there 15 mins earlier. He pretended to not understand what i was saying and sent another 'security' guy over to speak to me. i told him the same thing. He asked me to move to which i refused. he seemed annoyed but left. Anothe rissue on a night is that the staff are useless. they cannot get drink orders right and are very reluctant to want to give you any change. Its such a shame that the management allow this place to be such polar opposites depending on what time you visit.Definitely go here but go during the day, avoid the evening at all costs, unless you like that sort of thing!!"

I was visiting Bali with a group of friends during my vacation in March 2016, and was shocked to see the racist treatment of Indonesian and other ""nonwhite"" guests. The first night me and my friends went to La Favela, the person in front of me in the line at the entrance, who was Indonesian, was told that the party was full and that he had to leave. Me and my friends being next in line and white were then let straight in. A couple of days later we decided to go back to La Favela, only this time I brought an Indonesian friend of mine. As a result, none of us were let in, since we were with my Indonesian friend. Considering that the club is located in Indonesia, and that we're in 2016, I find this almost unbelievable. So if you're looking for a place to go out in Bali, i'd stay away from La Favela."

He did not ask an ID card nor how old I am and just simply rejected my visit.I dressed properly, I did not bring any beverages from outside, I was not yelling at anybody. And that was the treatment I got from La Favela.And just so you know, no caucasian were asked an ID card to enter to know how old they are this is only for Indonesian or Asianlooking guests.This bar is potentially to be one of the best in town however, the stupid so sorry behaviour from the security guard ruins everything. They are Indonesian who asked to do this kind of discrimination to Indonesian. Without being racist, this is totally unacceptable."

Oh man, what a place, what a night! When we walked in around ten pm, the first thing we noticed was the decor. Amazing interiors, very rich lighting and very classy. The dinner tables were still on and had a great lounge setting. Come midnight, the entire place turned into a night club. Great music and the crowd was fantastic. My only complaint was that we had a table for 8 and the staff suddenly came up to us after two hours of us sitting on the table and ordering drinks, food etc., and told us that the table was reserved for some Italians. I find it hard that they have a table reserved at two am for a bunch of people. I also found this to be extremely racist. We spent more more than any one can imagine that night and the staff needs to be respectful enough to know that racism is a thing of the past. It was a little disheartening consisting the place was so epic, but the staff definitely needs some life lessons. "

The inside is beautiful and you feel like you are in the 1920s or so. The decorator must have had a special eye for details. You can't make a phone because what you see can't be captured in a photo. Impressive! We decided to sit outside where there were a few ponds and a small way to walk through a small garden with nice palms and full green plants. Deciding where to sit is the hardest decision because every spot has his ups. We ordered ginger beer and lime juice for drinks. I was a bit disappointed cause the lime juice was just water with lime. No creamy juice from a blender. We ordered a wrap and a risotto. Both nice, well cooked. There could have been more spices on it, but that's a question of preference. The quality was good.After reading so many comments about racist attitudes from the staff I had a awkward feeling while I was sitting there. I think it is really bad for a restaurant/pub/ bar when there were guests who experienced things like that. Although the food was good, I would maybe not go there in the evening, I bet it looks good but especially outside is a party area for mosquitoes and I think it loses its secret charme when it is full of people trying to find a spot to eat and drink. But for lunch it is perfect."

He mentioned how it's ""Indonesians like you that always cause trouble."" Excuse me What country does he think he's in He put my friend through the works, mentioning to his security guard just how much he wanted to slap her for standing up for her friends. He even said, ""If you showed me some respect, I might have considered letting you in."" What kind of respect do you expect from the customer that you just offended We asked how old he was, and he said he was 18 years old. He looked so young I just had to asked him if it was legal for him to be there and work in a night club, and that's when he said ""Actually, I'm the son of the owner, so I can do whatever I want"".Whatever, kid, I'll take my business to a place that understands that locals are people too."

The waitress who was serving us was the most unpleasant woman I have ever had the chance to encounter. She was rude and impatient with our orders. For example, when we decided to add a soup instead of a drink which I suppose mixed up the usual order, but hey, you dont have to give me an attitude about it, she yelled at us and asked in the most condescending tone Youre supposed to order drinks. You messed up the entire food order. When we decided to settle the bill with a credit card, she decided without our permission to charge us in the currency of my country instead of in swiss francs. When I enquired about our rights to choose to pay in whichever currency, she told me the lamest excuse  that the manager requires them to choose the foreign currency. Last time I checked, the customer should have a right to choose the currency. I have so far never been to a restaurant in which the waiters would choose the currency for us without asking. At this point, we have had enough with this horrible service and asked her why she treated us so poorly let me remind you, our family has been polite with this lady. As a foreigner, we are especially cautious and sensitive with the way we act. Her answer was , its because youre Asian. Enough said. This behaviour would simply be unacceptable and illegal, too in the States. Unbelievably horrendous"

Prices are quire steep but the food was certainly good. The waitress almost threw a napkin at me  placed my friend's main course plate way out of her table mat, as if she couldn't be bothered anymore and we had to do the rest. They need to remember that in the service industry 'service' is everything. It's no good if your food is spectacular but you serve it with a frown on your face.

The waitress there gave us an earful and started shouting in a very rude tone and ended up saying ""this is not India"" that tone was full disgust and I'm sure if anyone else from India had heard her speak the way she did, they would have taken torn the place down.

My friend while eating, bit the whole red chilli which was in his dish, it was very spicy, and to subside the spiciness in his mouth he took 2 sips from the bottle we were carrying. Seeing that, the lady serving us came running to our table and almost snatched the bottle of his hand and showed a poster pasted on the wall saying ""No outside drinks and food allowed"". On the contrary we said it was just the water and we missed seeing that written on the wall. But that doesn't mean you come and snatch the bottle of our hand. And to our surprise, this lady passed a derogatory and racist comment saying ""This is not India! You don't do this here!!"" Seriously lady You freaking just told us that this is not India I personally love Thailand but that doesn't mean you put down my country. To add to it, we had ordered 6 dishes for 6 people with drinks so not like we were just chilling and not ordering any food. I can understand there is no outside drinks policy but have some customer service skills about it and not be racist. She wasn't even friendly or apologetic about it. She was plain rude and antiIndian. After this happened, we asked the lady to call the manager, and all the manager said was am talking to y'all nicely so there is no point arguing further and the lady cannot apologies for being racist, rude and uncouth.I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone after having experienced this!"

Upon arriving to the door, I watched as the security guards pondered excuses to deny my boyfriend and his friend entry. This notion made me weary but against my better judgement we all proceeded inside. We walked through a somewhat congested crowd and chose to stand near the back door on the dance floor. This area was positioned right below a VIP area. After about 5 minutes of being in this area my boyfriend and I felt something being dripped on us. We both looked up and my boyfriend caught the eye of a gentleman and his girlfriend hovering above us in the VIP section. The guy apologized and we left it at that, no hard feelings. A few moments later, his girlfriend, who was obviously intoxicated started to get hostile. She was yelling and pointing, and of course being in a loud nightclub I couldn't make out her words. My boyfriend made eye contact with her boyfriend again and said ""calm your girlfriend down"". His demeanor was firm, but not threatening or argumentative. At that moment his girlfriend threw her entire cup of alcohol in my face from above. I stood there in dismay, barely able to clear my burning eyes. Immediately after my friends and I were swarmed with security guards yelling and screaming in our faces. I was pleading with the security guards and asking them why they were handling the situation in that manner. I said ""please explain to me why you are throwing me out like this"". One guard yelled to me ""we don't want you in here"", another couldn't mutter a reason why. The guards and officers continued to yell, swarm me, and push me out the door. Mind you, I'm 5'2"" and 125 lbs. Politely asking me to leave would have been just fine. Of course, after being covered in alcohol I wanted to leave, but I just didn't understand why such force and dramatic antics were used. The people in VIP who were white, were not asked to leave or treated the way we were. Once outside, my boyfriend and I began questioning the antics and asked to speak with the owner. We spoke with several eye witnesses and cops who stated the establishment has a huge problem with race issues and deals with situations like this all the time. Nothing was resolved and I woke up this morning with bruises on my body....Utterly disappointing!"

I waited in the line and once I got to the front, I was told I was not allowed in because I had holes in my jeans. I explained to the security that I wanted to purchase bottle service and a man who identified himself as the owner told me the tables were sold out. I explained to him that I didn't necessarily need a table but really just a bottle of liquor to avoid going to the crowded bar. The Cavs just won the NBA Finals, it was packed He still declined to let me in. I stepped to the side and watched them deny every single black person that walked to the door. Literally every single person of color. The people were denied for whatever reason came to the mind of security at the moment. ""Your hat is too low,"" ""You shorts have too many pockets,"" etc ..... All of this aside, I would not go as far as to call them racist until I witnessed with my very own eyes a white girl with holes in her jeans be granted access. I stepped to the front and said to the owner, ""aside from race, what makes her different from me Her jeans have holes but she can come in"" he then waved the police over and had Officer Michael Ryan ask me to leave. I explained to the Officer that I was on public property and could stand on the sidewalk. After a bit of back and forth with the Officer and the owner, I decided that even if they changed their minds I did not want to spend my money in place with such a discriminatory ""dress code policy."" It's such a shame that in 2016 such things still happen. I urge everyone, regardless of race to avoid this place. The photo included shows what I was wearing when I was denied access. My outfit is identical to many other fans looking for a place to celebrate Cleveland's recent victory."

Of course it's not fair that some people were not allowed in. Maybe the dress code should be more clearly stated on the website Also if they were mean on the door before their policy has clearly changed. The door people, cloakroom staff and bar staff were polite and pleasant. I guess they just don't want hen dos and the like. That's fair enough. When you get in all I can say is  wow!

The door woman was rude and racist, despite the fact that we were a mixed group, she suddenly became very selective of who could come in. Pointing fingers and saying you, you not you was disgusting. She couldn't actually say it's because members of your party are black/mixed raced/Asian. It then changed to only guys in suits and girls in trousers, there was no clear reason as to why all of our group could not enter. Eventually thanks to one of the promoters the rest of our group was allowed entry despite being outside for 45 minutes. Upon entering the club I was shocked to find it had about 20 SMALL 'V.I.P' tables that could only sit five people crammed into the space provided. Looking around I could see why the door woman was selective and racist, as the only 'ethnic' minority in there were Brazilian people. Despite the fact that we had paid for a table we were treated like dirt in there and the service was appalling. I would not recommend this place to anyone that is of an ethnic minority as you will be made to feel as though you are lower than dirt if you are not Brazilian or white. London has so many good bars and is an amazing place to go out and this club completely lets it down 100. Members of my group who are white including myself were so unhappy with the blatant racism that they left after an hour. The rest of us soon followed suit and they were only to happy to refund our table. Which just goes to show how disgusting this place really is. I will never advise anyone to go here EVER!"

She looked me in the eyes and said the' guest lists were full' despite all the white people behind us walking in after we left, who were also on the guest list. Now there were some other nonwhite ladies but I could not help but notice that they were in a group of white people. Where as my friend and I were alone.Now call it what you must but if you are white, you will never understand where I am coming from, that woman was racist, accept it and move on. I read an interview by a woman, Daisy Payne, who is a door picker and she said no 'unattractive people' can be let in. That is not even a possibility because my friend and I looked flawless, dressed hot, wore heels and this woman did not even ask to see what was underneath our coats, she just sent us away.Daisy Payne also went on to say she was picked as a door bouncer because she is 'tall and blonde'. Now, I don't have to tell you there's a limit to races with blonde hair, you do that research for yourselves. I even saw people give money sometimes but I refuse to give money to a racist club to let me in after first rejected. They must pay them poorly to have that such stuck up attitudes. All they are doing is letting rich people in, they need to realize they themselves are not rich and get a nicer attitude.My advice to anyone going who is nonwhite, hope you have lot of money of a white friend to accompany you."

RACISM GALORE!!!This restaurant is very racist to all ethnic minorities such as Chinese, Indians, Blacks.I went in with my wife and kids to eat pizza and pasta in the evening. Worst mistake!!! The staff was rude but I sat down anyway as the kids were hungry. The Chinese customers  Indian customers were treated horribly but the White customers were treated very well. Next to us was seated the owner who simply told us that Asians were not welcome!!! IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, READ THE MANY OTHER SIMILAR REVIEW BELOW FROM OTHER CUSTOMERS!!!"

Food arrived within a reasonable amount of time and was phenomenal. Yes, it was expensive, but not more than anything else in Lucern. Waiter was friendly towards my date and I.However, just because I read some other reviews about the waiters being racist  I did notice that they were not as friendly to an Indian couple sitting next to us. Perhaps I was lucky not to receive that kind of treatment since I was with a local Swiss man I'm Singaporean Chinese. They weren't explicitly rude or anything, but just did not seem as happy to serve the couple as they did us. Just thought that this would be important to mention, because based on past experiences where I've traveled as a solo Asian female traveler, I know how much being treated badly just because of your race/appearance can spoil your trip or meal."

The food was overpriced. Which is fine, Lucerne is expensive and you're on vacation so be prepared to spend some money. That isn't the issue here. If you are from out of town prepare to be mistreated if you have any questions. Don't make any assumptions about how dinner works because the waitstaff will treat you poorly. And if you like risotto, don't order potatoes as a side or the proprietor will tell you you're wrong for liking those two things and ask you if you learned that in China, because your parents are from somewhere in Asia and all Asian looking people are Chinese and unsuited for this restaurant. Literally, here is how the exchange went:""And what do you want.""""I'll have the risotto please""""Large or small""""Large please.""""Fine. Moving to the next person You""First person: ""oh could I also have a side of roast potatoes""""What No, you don't do that. Potatoes and risotto Where did you learn that, China!"" No.""So my friend didn't get potatoes. I'm still thinking about how bad our treatment was days later, so do yourself a favor and walk 15 meters down the street to the next restaurant.

I had heard the Swiss were particular and apt to get mad at you for small things; but this restaurant takes it to a whole new level . First of all, I think it may be the owner that took our order  if so; he does not know what customer service or even being mildly polite is. Two in our party tried to order a large pasta to share  that was not allowed. Then to order tap water we were told there was a charge of 2.50 Euro  pretty ridiculous. But what really put the whole negative experience over the edge was when one of our group who happened to be of asian decent said they didn't want water or anything to drink, his response was, ""Where did you learn that from Asia"" I cannot believe how rude he was and the entire experience was offputting. His tone was snarky and made you feel like you were an annoying inconvenience being in the restaurant. The food was pretty mediocre as well. I ordered the seafood salad which was drowning in dressing and when I asked for butter or oil for my bread, the server said they would get some  never brought anything to the table. The whole evening really put a damper on our Switzerland experience. Do not go to this restaurant; you will be sorely disappointed and deeply insulted in the process. "

Instinctively, I expected the waiter to apologise; HE DIDN'T. He scurried to take some tissues. I was thinking in my head, at least he had the decency to wipe it off. NO, didn't wipe anything off. HE JUST USED IT FOR THE BOTTLEOkay, fine so my Dad was already frustrated and he wanted to leave but we had already waited 30 minutes for our food. We decided to stay. When the second waiter came around with two plates One pasta, One risotto, he asked as any normal person would, who is the pasta for Before any of us could even answer, he just threw the plates down on the table. FINE, if you're having a bad day, I'll let you have your win. But no, the two tables beside us who were white and could speak french were treated like royalty. The waiters would wait and communicate with them, compliment etc. I'm not even asking for you to tell me I'm the most beautiful person in the world but at least acknowledge that our difference is only the tones of our skin. Continually, they would shun from our table, they would not accede to our simple requests eg. asking for condiments, asking for the bill When we received the bill, to our horror, they charged us for the water!! My dad signalled for one of the waiters to come over and he told him that he did not want to pay for 1/4 of the water that the previous waiter did not even replace/apologise for. The waiter did not apologise and waved his hand in front of my Dad's face saying , ""If you're unhappy about water, I give you new one, if you can't pay no one is gonna pay for you so you better pay."" He interrupted my Dad in his speech and came down with a filled bottle. My Dad paid and just responded to the waiter that is wasn't even about the water to which the waiter scoffed. So this is a summary  NO APOLOGY  NEW BOTTLE OF WATER W.o.w The entire time, I felt like I was being treated like some degenerative waste of the earth that I wasn't worthy of the same level of interaction as the deemed superiors which was utter nonsense. Yes, I'm asian. But it doesn't give them the right to treat me any differently. This experience here was terrible and I felt so bad that we were in such a beautiful country on a holiday and we had to put up with this."

Confused by this, asked why, the security said the manager had told them I needed to step outside. I was baffled by this and I asked the security if he had the right person and since he was talking to me he could take the measure of me, did I seem drunk or disorderly and he replied No, but the manger has told me and I have to do it The security said I just need to go outside for a bit then It would be ok to come back in, to which I replied Even though you can see Im not Drunk to which he relied I know but Ive been told At that point I and several of my party decided I would rather leave then have me be put on the Naughty Step when I hadnt done anything to warrant it.Previous to the incident with me, the manager had sent the security to escort another member of our company to get her stuff and leave with no explanation given. Its hard not to think the management wasnt expressing some kind of racial profiling or bias in who he was removing from the club when the drunk group of loud girls chanting at me and my partner to kiss, the guy aggressively punching the air or the guy who rolled up his t shirt to show off his nipples while dancing all seemed to escape the attention of the eagle eyed manager but yet seemed to be cherry picking the people present with ethnic backgrounds to find offence with, who his own staff at least in my case expressed didnt think warranted removal. Considering it was in the very heart of SoHo, the liberal and vibrant centre of London it is worrying that this could be happening. A birthday celebration disrupted and ruined and has left a bitter aftertaste by what seemed to be deliberate singling out, profiling and prejudice to which no one will be held accountable."

On exit i asked the doorman if i would need a stamp to get back in afterwards he sneered at me and said i should take a 15 minute break and get some coffee, i asked what he meant as i was fine not intoxicated and had been having a good time with my husband no problems at all, the doorman became aggressive and rude and told me he wasnt asking me but telling me, i was shocked as i am a type 1 diabetic and insulin dependent so there is no way that i would drink to excess i thought he was mistakeb so had my cigarette and then returned to the club but the same doorman blocked entry and once again became aggresive with us i explained we had done nothing wrong and that our coats and drinks were inside. He told us to get our drinks and coats and leave for no reason. To avoid a scene we agreed ro leave after finishing our drinks but on returning to our table 2 other doorman came over and demanded we leave immediately and vegan manhandling us out of the door when we asked why we were being asked to leave the doormen had no idea, i said we havent done anything wrong the doormen agreed but said they had been given orders from the doorman outside The only explanation me and my Husband can come up with is racism as i am mixed race!!

There isnt any racism as other reviewers suggest, just a lot of self importance and condescension.If you are an audiophile, the stereo is incredible  think lots of McIntosh tube amps and Tannoy speakers. The vinyl collection is incredible. But my suggestion would be to skip this one and visit their other location, Tracks, where you can have a conversation at a normal level and not worry about laughing occasionally.Maybe this place will continue to appeal to tourist, but I doubt it.

This place is only good for Japanese people or people who loves to stay mute yes, I repeat: to stay muuuuutuuuue and asking drink all time because they will only realizase youre there when youre glass is empty.If you go, be aware of:If you are not Japanese, for them you are like rubbish;Music is fantastic but Tokyo is plenty of bar s with such great music and a quite greater atmostfere so forget echar it is written in the famous tourist guide;The cocktails are awful: for example, we asked for Moscow mule and they added ginger!!! So, 2 ugly Moscow mule  4 ugly draft beers  6,400 yen. We decided to stay there because of the music but after having heard Japanese laughing and speaking very laudling during all the time and that only to me they told me to speak quietlier to me only and realise to be the only foreign believe me, the first time in my like, it is quite disgusting.In short, I only deserve some kind of karma for this racist people.And please, please, go to another please, Japonese people are in general much much better than people ruling this bar for us, these people have been the black sheeps in our marvellous trip in this great country."

We were continually interrupted every 10 minutes by rude, racist and verbally aggressive staff. We were constantly being watched and told to keep our 'English voices down'. They kicked us out for no valid reason whatsoever and a departing comment of 'go back to your own country' after we paid the bill. There are much better bars in Tokyo with better value, service and acceptance of foreigners. This is one place to stay well clear of."

Claims of ""racism"" against American tourists abound. However, the experience of myself and my friends couldn't have been more pleasant. We loved it so much, we went back three times during our stay! Tokyo can be a vast, cold city, but Bar Martha felt just like our local bar, ""Judy's Twin Pines"" in Rhinelander, Wisconsin... the only thing missing were the cheese curds! : The Budweiser was served ice cold in cans, just like back home! They gave us free bar mix that was crunchy and salty!... and the sliders were outstanding. I tried my friend's nachos and they were as good as the nachos I get at Chilis. My understanding is this place used to pride itself on being a little pretentious, playing only vinyl records and making sure people didn't talk or laugh too loudly. Perhaps there are new owners, as we were pleased to find they allowed patrons to take turns plugging in their iPhones to supply the music. There were two couples from Cleveland whose playlist included Bon Jovi and Donna Summer... but when ""Sweet Caroline"" came on, the entire bar joined in to sing the chorus, ""Bah, Bah, Bah!"" with gusto! On our last night, my friend Ruth brought her mom who had two glasses of Chardonnay and got a little tipsy. The bowtied bartender was so sweet. He made room for us at the bar by asking a few Japanese patrons to please stand so my friend's elderly mom could sit. He even made her some coffee and gave her a package of Oyster Crackers. We did notice a lot of Japanese people come in and leave, but the tiny place got crowded with a large tour group from Texas who arrived in an orange bus. In short, if you are tired of crazy food, raw fish and crowds of people speaking Japanese... and are looking for a place that feels like home, this is it! Please try the guacamole and tri color tortilla chips... and if Evan or Jennifer are working the bar, please tell them ""The Wisconsin Six"" say, ""You betcha!""Delete review"

Do not visit.","Why go to bar Martha when there are much better bars in Tokyo that also dont have racist and rude staff It was two friends and me. We had caught the cab over from nogizaka specifically to visit this place. I had heard the rumors about staff that will tell you to be quiet so I was prepared for that. However, I wasnt prepared for outright racism. Note that my friend and I are both half Japanese  Im a Japanese citizen. We were speaking Japanese. For a place that builds its reputation for how quiet it is I was surprised to go in to find that it was definitely a normal sounding bar. So then when they made us wait at first in the corner, I felt we could just talk like normal human beings out on a Friday night. Straight away, one guy came over to tell us to shut up. We were not being loud or belligerent in anyway, simply having a conversation  as other guests were. We ordered drinks. We never got them. Five minutes in and the guys came over once again and this time to tell us to leave the place. We were shocked. It turned racist. I pointed out that Im japanese, born in japan. As he opened the door to shoo us out  he said, yes please leave Japan. I have never been treated so badly at a bar before we had even got our drinks!! The place itself is so average, so its just pretentious of them to act this way. Dont bother visiting this place. Theres a ton of other great bars in Tokyo. We went to Bar Trench afterwards to recover, and the staff were great to us. Absolute never again for Bar Martha. "

But I feel that my horrible experience at Bar Martha last night warrants one.I live in Tokyo and had heard about Martha from several people over the years, but only got around to checking it out earlier this year with some friends visiting from overseas. The first time I went I thought the staff were a bit pompous and rude. As above reviews point out, there is an absolutely NO photos policy, as well as a very strict standard for what constitutes being ""noisy"". My friends and I were literally just talking and at one point one of us laughed, I think, and it triggered a member of staff to tell us to quiet down. I brushed that off and decided, ""OK, that's just Bar Martha. Keep the noise down and enjoy the tunes."" That was merely a foreshadowing of the horrendous experience I had there last night when I took a local friend. She had never been and we were in the area so I proposed checking it out. My friend did laugh somewhat loudly at one point and they did the standard Martha thing and asked her to quiet down. I explained to her that they were strict about noise and she understood, though agreed that it was overkill. But that was nothing compared to what came next. For some reason I had the idea that customers could request songs or something along those lines. Curious about this, I casually approached the DJ booth to ask him what the system was for music. I asked in Japanese, which I speak pretty well though not fluently, and then followed up with a little English just to be sure I had clearly asked my question when he simply stared  no, GLARED  back at me. This is when things went into full meltdown mode. The DJ became irate, as if I had disrespected one of his deceased family members or something, and said in an extremely cross tone that ""This is Japan. You do NOT use English."" Etc. Then, when I tried talking things down he requested for staff to literally throw my friend and I out. The bar tenders uniformly GLARED at me and robotically said through plastic, passiveaggressive grins, ""Please go. JUST GO."" Wagging their heads up and down in affirmation. I tried asking several times, ""What did I do wrong Wait, what did I do wrong"", trying to diffuse the situation. But to no avail.My friend, a native Japanese speaker, also tried to ask what we did wrong and they were just downright hostile. They told us to leave in no uncertain terms, in front of a crowded bar. If I wasn't in utter shock I would have felt extremely embarrassed on top of disrespected. When we got outside, my friend tried to reason with one of the staff, who simply kept repeating, ""This is Japan."" etc. and giving no real clear idea of what we actually did ""wrong"". I've lived in Japan for almost eight years total. I don't normally like to complain about treatment of foreigners here because I realize I'm a guest in their country. And generally, the standard of service here is worldclass. But I'm sorry to say that the feeling I had was genuinely one of being treated in a completely racist manner. After we walked away, my friend was literally crying. This gives some indication of how extreme the treatment was. Hands down, it was the worst I've ever been treated by the staff of a bar or restaurant. If you are a diehard music lover and simply MUST go to Martha while in Tokyo, please consider yourself forewarned. There are lots of other great bars to listen to music in Tokyo. Please don't give this one your business unless you like being treated with thinly veiled contempt by racist, selfimportant staff who may literally tell you to shut up or even kick you out for doing nothing more than raising your voice a few decibels above a normal conversational level  or God forbid, if you laugh."

The owner clearly has some issues mentally. Screaming and shouting at two young gentlemen, swearing at them. He then proceeded to to call one of them tubby and told him to F off for being English. He then proceeded to get off his chair and try and square upto the two gents. The food was terrible and the owner clearly doesnt have a clue what hes doing. Frankly he deserves to lose his business. Hes racist, sexist, not very funny and his loneliness is very clear when he has to try and entertain with his in appropriate Jokes. No one deserves this kind of service..."

The set up means that if you're waiting for your washing, you wait in the Cafe area where you're not allowed to eat your own snacks and drink out of your water bottle despite probably paying much more than the cafeonly patrons. Finlay was friendly, but we were made to feel really uncomfortable and patronised by the older owner  who has a very misguided, racist and condescending 'sense of humour', so we eventually left with our slightly damp clothes in hand. Completely unimpressed by this awful service and definitely wouldn't recommend to other young travellers."

After commenting on my partners hair and insultingly misjudging his age, he eventually took our order while commenting on every item. My partner has some difficulty hearing at times and the man spoke fast and did not appreciate being asked to repeat anything. He did not seem to like that we didnt find his jokes funny. He asked where we were from and commented on that then asked why we were in Edinburgh. When told that we were there for a gig, began putting down the people who went to gigs in the Queens Hall, commenting on their age, dress and style. He started to make racist and antiEnglish comments. Definitely not a place to go for a quiet or fast bite to eat. I finished my cup of tea a cup with teabag floating in it well before my food arrived.Now the food, I ordered a quiche which was probably the worse specimen of its kind that I have ever eaten! It was blasted in a microwave before it came to me so soggy pastry, too much cheese on top and bland strange textured content..My partner had a microwaved baked potato with a cholesterol intense pile of cheese melted into it He had tried to ask which fillings were available but the man seemed to want him to order cheese, only belatedly mentioning beans or tuna! He the started commenting on my partners choice of drink, announcing to everyone in the shop, that he must be watching his weight, as he had ordered diet Iran Bru!!Possibly the worse cafe in Edinburgh, definitely a bad decision to make!Racist, sexist, xenophobic chauvinist with a misguided sense of humour!

I was wearing an Indian suit, and just as I entered the store, the guy looks like Scottish from the counter asks me if I was dancing Bhangra a dance style from India. I smiled at that comment and then picked up few stuffs from the store and went to the counter and then he said that a lot of brown ladies come into the store. I smiled, said ok and while waiting to be served, he spoke to me in Punjabi, when I told him I don't know the language come on, there are more than 22 official languages in India, he put me to shame by saying that I should be knowing the language he spoke. I spoke to someone else waiting for their coffee and he commented something about my accent. I was cool all this while and waited to get out of the store as soon as possible, that's when the next one followed. He asked me not to marry an Indian Hindu guy and that they were all liars. I am already married to one and I smiled and told him that's it was too late and that I was married to one already. And finally when he said he gets to flirt with all the brown ladies coming into the store mention of colour again, I confronted him that I might have to report his behaviour being racist. He laughed about it and then read aloud my full name from my debit card, peeped when I was typing my PIN number and announced the start of the PIN number. Totally humiliated, shamed by the service! And finally, he decided to serve hot chocolate instead of coffee as I asked for cold coffee, managed to come up with something which was Terrible. There were lumps of chocolate powder here and there and tasted pathetic. He asked me to come again by the day so that I can see the owner dunno if he was the owner, and that I will know why the brown ladies keep coming the the store. Terrible, inappropriate, sexist, racist person alert!!! Never going back again. "

We were shocked and had not experienced this rudeness previously during our travels. We were unsure of the reason considering the restaurant was empty bar two tables of guests but after reading other traveller reviews realised it was secondary to racism.

We decided to go and see ourselves. I have taken a photo of the sign and I am attaching it to this review, hoping that will be posted. It is in Spanish and it basically translate to: Israelis that dont accept to live in peace with Palestinians are not allowed here. Maybe I am a little slow, but I dont think this statement is racist nor antiSemitic, to me it seems to promote peace, I guess the people upset about it are in favor of war and decided to call the guy racist to get back at him. Anyway lets now talk about the real reason we should talk about this place  food! We ordered the popular 25 mixed grill for 2 people. We were served 4 courses. 1 4 different kind of sausages2 2 different cuts of pork chops3 2 chicken breast4 2 fillet mignonEvery single dish was mouth watering and cooked to perfection. We ordered 2 glasses of house wine very decent and 2 bottles of water. The final bill was  36. Both my friend and I felt it was the best mix grilled we ever had for this kind of money. The restaurant has a very warm and colorful decor. The service was ok.

I'd lived in the area for a decade, had heard good things about the Hoagie Ranch, but somehow managed to never visit. That was my loss. The Hoagie Ranch is by far my favorite place to eat!We stop in for lunch a couple times a week and for dinner a couple times a month. It's extremely hard to have a favorite, but if pressed, I'd claim the Rueben...or the John Wayne...wait...the Bonanza Burger! My wife appreciates the home made soups!The spaghetti dinner special is great as is the home made lasagna but the steaks on Friday night truly shine. It's amazing what Jim can do with a sirloin steak. They are always perfectly trimmed and expertly cooked. This is the best sirloin steak you will ever have!As fine as the table fare is at the Hoagie Ranch that really isn't why we go there so often. We go because of the atmosphere created by Jim and Jan. The decor is a fascinating throw back to my childhood and beyond, peppered with collectibles and western paraphernalia. It's a warm, homelike ambiance. Jim and Jan are the Hoagie Ranch. Honestly, it angers me to read some of the reviews making false claims of racism or rudeness. I guess that's the nature of the Internet and the time in which we live. Jim and Jan are extremely nice people who truly care about their business, their customers and their extremely loyal staff.

I might have been living out Groundhog Day because we got denied entry in the same rude, dismissive obnoxious manner for a second time. After polite enquiry as to the reason for denying my friend and I entry, the simple response was given by the senior bouncer who was a tall, skinny and angry gentleman of Aryan appearance saying ""We do not want your kind here"". Reading some of the other posts here it has become apparent that there is a clear racist judging criteria for who is allowed entry to this joint.

We waited in the queue for about 1.5 hours only to be told by the same guy, sorry guys not tonight.Such was our 'respect' for this place that we decided to pay it a visit on Sunday afternoon. So once again, we waited in the queue and finally made it to the door. A different guy this time gave us a long look and started speaking to us in German. I told him sorry man we don't speak German. He said sorry guys you can't come in and looked the other way. He was in no mood for any confrontation. I feel perplexed by the whole incident.

So by 23:10 we were already there at the door but they still couldnt let us in. We asked for a valid reason but the blond girl came with a stinky attitude and said that theyre busy and not taking walkings. A short guy came and said the same. Unfortunately none of them had name badges and so one cant even identify them by their names which is also not a hotel standard. All staff should have name badges on. So we decided to stand there and as we were watching everyone else who was coming was being asked if they had a reservation and they could say no and to our surprise they were being let in! So we wondered was it because we were two black ladies or whats the reason This was total discrimination and intimidating. You shouldnt treat people like that or judge them by their race or looks! The blond woman with a British accent and that short guy seem racist as shouldnt be in a hospitality industry.Something should be done cos this is a total mess. Who rolls their eyes on guests and looking at them from head to toe like she owns the place. And even her way of talking is just so disgusting, no smile,very rude and making one look so small. But why would management want to have such kind of people who are ruining the reputation of the place and spoiling the guests moods by being treated in such a way.

Only Swedish allowed!,"I would say: ""Well, the beer taste ok but the service was terrible"" or ""the food was amazing but the place was not so clean"". But...unfortunately I cannot because this happened: I was with some of my friends; the bouncer outside asked me for the ID. I gave mine swedish and I dropped in. Then, my friends with an european ID but not swedish showed theirs. Result No possibility to get in. I thought: Why. They are not drunk or in ""some way"" dangerous, they are adult, they have theirs documents. When I asked in the local language the reason, the bouncer said to me: ""BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE A SWEDISH ID"". Stunned I replied: ""So, if you are a tourist, you can't get in"" and the bouncer told me: "" NO TOURISTS ARE ALLOWED! IF YOU ARE NOT SWEDISH YOU CANNOT COME IN"". Conclusion When we tried to explain the gravity of the situation about the racist conduct, the bouncer just assert that yes, she was racist. Now. I just let you judge, because here it's not a question of bad service or good food, but a real BRAIN ABSENCE!"

We were not even in the mood to get drunk a 2month pregnant woman among us. Even it took us some time to decide where to go. One of us suggested lion bar because it stays later. He reminded us that they can be rude and sometimes racist. We didn't believe it. Come on in sweden, we said. I guess we were naive. They didn't even try to pretend. They just boldly said we will not serve you. We were shocked. And our friend told us about the other similar event where they were served one beer and told to go out of the bar because one of them was drunk. And funny thing, they pointed out the guy who was not even drinking. I kid you not. I just don't understand why they are doing this. It is not an exclusive place. We are just shocked."

I give it no stars because, yes, we did not even have the chance to sample what they have. What is clear to me from our experience tonight and from reading other reviews is that the people who run this place DO NOT care about their customers the most. Why would you choose to dine in a place that only cared about getting as much profit as possible at the expense of the welfare, comfort, and satisfaction of its customersThe front of house staff/ receptionist, who was identified as the owner in another review, welcomed my husband by telling him, ""You have to make sure you buy four plates because this is a restaurant."" We were still by the door of the restaurant then. I could not understand what he was trying to imply by that statement. I told him straight to the point that that was impolite and rude. Clearly, we were there to have dinner, so why did he have to say that He responded by asking what our nationality was, which I think was irrelevant. I cannot help but assess this as a racist evaluation. I strongly communicated my disappointment by asserting that he should not treat his potential customers that way. It was insulting. He ended up literally shooing us away. Talk about caring about the people to whom you cater !! Aside from this terrible experience we had and those of others, I truly wonder what else this man is willing to do or is doing in terms of operations, handling of food, personnel management in order to ensure he gets his priorityto profit as much as possible."

Last time was 5 years ago and service was soso even I went at nonpeak hours. The mussels there were really good so I decided to give it another try this time. I went at dinner rush hour this evening and the restaurant was obviously half empty so I was expecting to have at least soso service from the staffs.I have greeted, believed to be the manager politely but he's ignored us and kept looking around the restaurant, apparently he wasn't busy but just didn't want to serve us. Some French came in to the restaurant afterwards and he's served them a table immediately. So I waited for like few more minutes and they still didn't get back to us.After greeting him politely for one more time into his face ""excuse me, there's the two of us and we are coming for dinner"" he was kinda rude and just yelled at one of the waiters and asked him to serve us a table.Why did I mention they mainly just the manager were being racist, was that they squeezed us into the worst, smallest table in the restaurant. Believe it was a space just barely fits in 3 tables for a group of six. The restaurant was still half empty by that time and I didn't get why they didn't get us a better seat.I had only like 15cm of space to the next table and I had to squeeze inside. Later on the manager proactively asked the 4 French customers next to us to change to another table. I didn't realize it was a change on purpose until like 10 minutes later, a pair of French couples came in and the waitress appointed them to the table next to us. The manager yelled at the waitress immediately and asked the French change to another seat again.The waiter who served us was friendly and the food was good. We ordered one originals set meal and one more pot of Brussels, plus two large beers.But I couldn't tolerate the racist actions from the manager at all. Seriously I felt bad about the table changing act, he waited until the customers got seated and proactively asked them to move to another seat like we have virus with usAcknowledging both of us were Asian from Hong Kong, I wondered if I am really looking or acting that bad and normal to be that racist I was staying silent most of the time and just chatted very occasionally and I believed I had good table manner after all.

After reviewing the menu, we called a midaged waitress for ordering the meal. Since we did not quite understand her words with strong French accent so asked her politely, but she lost her patience immediately and gave us the attitude. What shocked us more is that we did not even finish the order but she just went away from our table, refusing to take our order. Then we had no choice but to ask other waiter for the order, and the waiter was also pretty passive in action. During our meal, we asked the same lady for some empty plates, she said okay but let us wait more than 5 minutes and never came back. I am not sure if the waiters treat us like this because we are Asians who cannot speak French. Honestly I think the food is quite nice and I really love the mussels, but the terrible service experience truly ruined my day. I had bad feelings like we are treated with racism here, very sad. :"

We had to wait 25 minutes to get seated despite lots of empty tables  symptomatic of the lackadaisical and shoddy attitude of the staff. After being seated, waiters with nothing to do refused to take our orders. It took so much effort to call for a waiter who rudely told us that we minimally needed to order one main per person. Having tolerated enough poor service for the night, we walked out. The service here is ghastly. I will never return and never recommend this place to anyone. Further, the staff needs to undergo serious retraining and the French service sector a significant restructuring if there is any hope for the French economy.Also, there were slight racial undertones that I sincerely hope are misplaced beliefs.

They were looking forward to a great family outing taking their two toddlers there for pizza after a trip to Oatland Island. They arrived about 3pm on a slow Friday 3/5/13. Many empty tables, but some people there. They walked out. The reason is no one addressed them, and when they tried to seat themselves, they were told ""you can't sit there"". They moved to another area. Again, ""you can't sit there"". No one told them where to sit, or acted if they were welcome. They stood and waited, and waited. Again, no staff seemed interested in this family being there, so, they left disappointed. I personally am embarrased at the lack of customer service having recommended. Moreover, they felt as if it could be racial as they were the only black family there. For this, I believe the place needs to say otherwise and apologize, or gain a reputation of intolerance. I will never set foot there again, and will let people know the impression I have, and this wonderful family has of the establishment."

My mother and I African Americans were treated extremely poorly and rudely tonight by the Danish owner while she greeted white/European clients with smiles and pleasantries. The Ecuadorian male took our order, chatted with us, gave us the WiFi password, and pointed out the games. He wanted us to enjoy our tea experience. My mother and I sat down to enjoy our overpriced tea drinks as we are tea lovers and wanted to sample their teas. Later the Danish owner came in a very foul mood. I asked for panela/sugar; she was instantly annoyed and unpleasant. I asked for a spoon and she seemed even more annoyed to have to service me even though I had already paid for the teas. As the cafe doors were still open, two groups of white/Europeans entered and she greeted them with smiles and stated the menu. She mentioned loudly that she was tired and the place was closed but she could make them items to go. As my mother and I got the hint and finished up our teas, the rude Danish owner came over and asked if we wanted something else because they were closed. I told her she was rude and asked why she was pleasant to white people who came after closing time. She ignored me. Upon leaving I told the Ecuadorian male he shouldn't have sold us tea if it was closing time. He pointed to the menu and said ""It says 8 to 8."" We went to Honey Coffee  Tea afterwards. The staff was pleasant and when closing time gave the waiter put the ""closed"" sign up and told entering guest they were closed. They didn't rush nor rudely tell eating/drinking guests to leave. They were professional and decent. Definitely a better experience at Honey, who was full with ethnically diverse customers. Ali Cumba should learn from Honey."

I chose to go to Excet because there was no queue at the entrance. Excet is a nightclub located in Vasagatan 52, Gothenburg, Sweden.The clubs doorkeeper refused me entry, his excuse was that i am over the age of 28. I politely reminded him that age discrimination is forbidden in Sweden. He then changed tactic and accused me of being drunk and aggressive, suddenly a group of guards gathered by the entrance so I went to a policeman standing nearby to complain. The policeman wasnt surprised and keenly encouraged me not to waste my time and money on this nightclub.Excet had some issues in the past with regard to racism, I was hoping they have learned from their past mistakes. Unfortunately they didnt change attitude, they only changed tactics. When they see you have a dark skin, they tend to use your age to get rid of you and when they fail, they will accuse you of being drunk and aggressive, then call a good number of guards on you. These guards are rude and aggressive.So if you want to drink a beer in Excet in the year of 2013, that is 68 years after the Holocaust, you must fulfill these 2 conditions:1 You must have a white skin.2 You must be under the age of 28.Needless to say that racism and age discrimination are punishable under Swedish law."

I was trying get her out when the owner came and asked her to leave. I asked to speak to him privately to apologize for my friend. He then stated that he didn't want to hear anything I had to say in a bad tone of voice. At this point I said, ""Whatever"" and got my friend out of there. He then screamed abuse at us at which point I found out she was banned from the lounge. I told him to ""shut up"" because he was upsetting her. He then said, ""You're black, you're black"" and started making derogatory gestures toward me. Although the person I was with did get sloppy drunk, I don't think it called for treating her sober acquaintance with such disrespect. I will never go to CP Lounge in Ubud."

I looked for a manager to complain but there was noone. If the manager wants to get in touch with me about what was said by his staff, I am happy to give details  in the UK, I believe they would have broken the law. Two female staff, young, dark hair/dyed blonde. Giggling. You then get espresso in cardboard cup and a cake on a tinfoil tray, and try to find a seat and a clean table  if you can. Appalling service.

And after scrolling through the reviews, I see I am not alone.I came here for dinner with my husband and another couple. It was our first night in Positano. My husband and I are from Sydney, Australia, though I was born in HK and, at our table, I was the only person of full Asian descent. Everything was going fine  the food was lovely, the atmosphere was homely but nice. And then, towards the end of our meal, our waiter who I can only assume was the owner came out to chat to us. In the midst of the chatter, he proceeded to tell me that all Asians look the same to him, and he can never tell them apart. When I politely told him I thought he was wrong, he impressed his point by taking his index fingers to the outside corners of his eyes and said, ""yes, they all look like this"". We were all so stunned by this disgusting behaviour that we were speechless. I didn't want to make a scene, so just looked down at my food and he walked off chuckling.Not long after that we left, and on my way out I spoke to 2 younger women who ran the front of house. I told them what the man had said to me and that I was very offended. Astonishingly, one of the women simply shrugged her shoulders and said ""what's the problem, it's like if you said all Italians have big noses"". My husband then stepped in and assured her that no, it was not like that at all and in any event, entirely irrelevant as I didn't say that he was Italian and therefore had a big nose, and would never say that because it's a completely stupid thing to say. It was only after a 5min exchange along these lines that the other woman interjected and apologised  but by then I was walking out the door.Absolutely disgusting. Why be in hospitality in an international tourist hub if you are racist Do not come here. There are many more deserving restaurants in Positano with amazing food AND friendly and nonracist service. Give your money to a place that actually deserves it."

The gentleman with the glasses made us repeat the question in three most commonly spoken languages in Basel, which we know fluently. Our faces and the fluency of the languages did not seem to get the message across, who nodded his head and wandered off. Precisely 5 minutes later, my husband asked a different waiting staff if we could have a baby chair and sit inside. The gentleman did not even bother to respond and walked past despite looking at us. The previous waiter went past and failed to acknowledge our presence. Precisely after additional 5 minutes, my husband went to the bar and this time asked what we needed to do to get an answer from them Another staff member responded we are busy, you have to wait. Despite the number of attempts to politely ask for the high chair and the terrace only being slightly busy it was 3:30 pmand the inside being almost empty, the very very competent staff delivered service excellence in the reverse order by completely racially profiling us.

However, the Midtown Drinkery thoroughly repulsed me last night with its complete and blatant DISCRIMINATION! Prior to going to the Midtown Drinkery, we called to find out if guys could wear shorts. The answer was yes. When we arrived, the guys we were with had no problem getting in with shorts and flip flops. However, one of our friends had a friend come to meet him/us, and that friend was dressed nicely  fashionable jeans, a nice button down shirt, very clean cut and a smart, successful young man to top it off. I asked why the friend was standing on the other side of the railing we were outside, and he said ""because they won't let me in...they said my jeans were too baggy."" After the initial, jawdropping shock, I proceeded to watch numerous people come into the bar wearing flipflops, baseball hats, tshirts, and the exact same type of jeans our friend was wearing  if not more baggy. Anything less baggy, and our friend would have been wearing ""skinny"" jeans. Just as I have read in all the other reviews in here, the friend was ASIAN. Do we not live in one of the most diverse cities in the world Don't we have a thriving city filled with successful, educated individuals who should have the right to go out and be treated as equals Well, last night, this clearly was not the case. Not only did they turn the friend away, but our group of 6 walked out  discarding drinks that were still full  as we are not going to patronize a business that treats people like this. I confronted the door men/""bouncers"" whose shirts read ""Security"" and flatout told them they are racist and asked what was wrong with them, treating people like this  in this day and age. When I confronted the caucasian man at the door in a suit  possibly a manager  who seemed to be the one making all of the decisions  he refused to look me in the eye. He was clearly uncomfortable and had no words to respond to my accusation of them being racist. This place is losing business every night because of their behindthetimes ways. They WILL be exposed for this  beyond just these Yelp reviews. Whatever you do  whatever race or ethnicity you are  DO NOT patronize this place or its other location on Washington, as they likely share the same backwards mentality. Thank you!"

My brief interaction with the Manager was enough, despite being from the UK, I could easily pass for a local and, as such, the Manager came over to our table, spoke to the other people with his back to me he appeared to be collecting business cards and then turned to me and when I pointed out I did not hear a word, he gestured as if to say I clearly wouldn't understand anyway!

Definitely not ""Aloha""...","I have never had to write such a strong negative review about a place.Just looking at the other reviews around TripAdvisor, you already have a pretty good picture of the obnoxious and arrogant venue that you can expect if you make the mistake of even considering this place for a night out.In my 26 years of living in the UAE, I have seen them all, from the ostentatious to the lowkey bar/clubs, but never have I seen such a fake, moneycrazed place.The front/door staff are racist, only let you in if you're willing to spend major , and are extremely rude. I went to Mahiki the 2nd day they opened, expecting a refreshing change from Barasti/Trader Vicks ie: Tropical cocktails without the salsa. It was all ""Please come in! Can I recommend you some cocktails"" I took a seat at a table with a friend and we had a few cocktails. A month later, with another friend, we were denied entry under the pretext that we needed a reservation, yet ample amounts of women dressed like highclass escorts were allowed in.Figuring that the place was getting popular and all ""Dubai'ed"" up, we decided to opt for a table the next time around: ""Can't beat 'em, join'em right! WRONG!""When we got there, we booked a table, spent over 4000 Dhs 1,100 on drinks, and if not for the company of friends that I was in, it would have been a terrible night.Their socalled treasure chest is just a fancy gimmick for watered down juice, barely got us tipsy, the cocktails were horribly sweet they could learn a lot from Trader Vicks, the music was terribly loud, the smoke was very dense, but the worst part of it, the atmosphere just sucked.You can smell the ""fake"" from a mile away, Mahiki pretends to be something it's definitely not. They preach ""Aloha"" and pacific slang, yet probably could not point out Polynesia on a world map. When I wrote a similar complaint on their Facebook page, they deleted my comment. They're so full of themselves they can't even accept criticism. Just wannabes trying to milk the rich residents of Dubai for as long as possible.Good news, I've been here long enough, it wouldn't surprise me to see them change management soon enough, and eventually, they will close down.People of Dubai, tourists, fellow Tripadvisers, do NOT waste your time and money in Mahiki.It's a great city for a night out, and you'd much rather spent it somewhere else!"

Pretentious joint managed by a bunch of ""blue collar"" unprofessional rude Westerners with absolutely no manners. We ladies decided to have a night out and made the mistake of going to Mahiki because of a ""freedrinks for ladies promotion"" advertised on Facebook and on until yesterday. The poor waiter didn't have a clue so we asked for the manager who happened to be a Brit. Immediately without the curt greeting or even a hello, he started barking abusive words such as ""Cheap"""" cheesy women trying to get free bees by manipulating the establishment. Now in his home country that will be ground for a reprimand. You do not talk to ladies and your customers like that. He then went on saying that he had full rights to kick us out and he will do so. This is without us even sitting down and ordering our first drinks. His attitude/tone was full of racial haltered. So we asked for his supervisor and that guy was even ruder and aggressive to the point of being physical. We have travelled all over the world and have never ever experienced such abusive behavior. Some of us have the could easily afford to buy a few rounds for all present , some of us are from the media and the legal profession. So this is not the last these morons hear from us. Meanwhile we will spread the word as we do not expect such a cheap establishment to apologize.Its a great disgrace to Dubai and to its rich Eastern culture. The saying "" customer first"" doesn't apply here. White skin most welcome and people of color should not lavishly spend  they do have the highest spending power in Dubai! their money at such  and there a very many in and around Dubai. I hope one day the Dubai authorities pay attention to this type of misconduct."

This is a venue that should get tripadvisor to introduce a new rating, zero out of five as a minimum instead of one. And the suggested description for this zero rating One is ""terrible"", zero is ""Mahiki"". Well done Folks..This is a venue which has door policy, just like most of the clubs in Dubai. Preference is given to couples and ladies. If this does not apply to you or your group, then you need to book a table. No matter how regular you are. So far so good, and I do not have any complaint.The main problem with this venue is doormen. How can such spot keep everything under their control  No matter how many times you visit booking a table, they do not recognize you at the door. Same Questions: Reservation Name Here are two incidents: We arrived once two guys at around 11PM. This time, we did not have a booking. It was an unplanned visit after our plans to travel for a weekend did not work out. First thing that came to mind was Mahiki. We tried getting in, however we were not allowed even though we were regulars. The manager could not help and kept it up to the doormen. I was disappointed and did not want to come back or book it in the future. My friend had a neutral feeling, that they do this to anyone. My feeling After reading the reviews here, I know better what's going on, and I tend to agree, there is racism.. unfortunately.. too bad.. we thought of your club as first option, and you do this to us... while some other clubs in Dubai recognize you as a regular and treat you well from the second if not first visit. Under pressure from my friend , we decided to come back, since we had some visitors from abroad, this time as a group of five guys and one girl. We had a booking, however, doormen tried to make execuses not to let us in. I called the manager however, the useless statement were offered by her "" Entry is at the discretion of doormen"" and ""you might not be the proper mix"". But we have a booking , you did not tell us on phone No good answer from her side. Aloha!!Again, how can they keep everything with doormen If there is no booking, I understand.. you need couples and ladies, However, you cannot let doormen turn down people even when they book. That's ridiculous..Whether they are aware of the doormen's practices or not, this is something I cannot know for sure, let's be fair. However, my feeling is that they tend to be selective when they are overbooked, and to be nice when they are not full Of course assuming you have a booking.Now, about the inside. I won't write much. It's not worth visiting if they spoil you night at entrance. Food: Nothing special about it compared to the prices. Drinks: I tried several mixes and I did not enjoy them, for example , the long Island was too heavy to drink and the worst in had worldwide London, New york , Arizona , Las Vegas, Milan , etc.. . With the ridiculous prices you charge, you ought to teach your bartenders how to mix drinks much better.Shame on you Mahiki. I am still arguing with my friend and fighting with him since he pressured me to come back. You really set the standards in terms of customer service, ie. the minimums!"

Uimh hArabaigh cheadatear or A Hundred Thousand Welcomes... to NonArabs! That's right! We'll make sure Western men go right through the door, one dignified man at a time while their Bahraini friend is stranded outside! We'll do this over and over just to make sure YOU would get that full, authentic, 100 Irish pub experience! We wouldn't do that in any Irish RESTAURANT in Ireland but hey, this is no Bennigans... That one is only 76 Irish experience and we want to give you no less than 100!""On numerous occasions, I've been stranded outside Though dressed professionally after all my Western male friends were allowed in. One guy at a time. It's interesting to see this isn't only my experience, but that of many other Arabs in the review section below. This is clearcut discrimination on JJs manager's Siyana Koycheva part. I'll mention your name directly, because someone needs to feel accountable.On other cases, the bouncer tried to aggressively intimidate me when I 100 politely asked him to locate the door policy couldn't happen to locate it myself, neither could he for that matter, not to deny that it could be there. He'd invade my personal space and yell at me for that basic question, basically communicating that I should just compute that I'm not welcome. One time a bouncer allowed my female friend right in, while searching me he accused me of ""bringing along an escort"" just so I'd be allowed inside. An extremely insulting and degrading accusation, in my own country. When these issues are brought up, ones that Arabs exclusively experience, JJs Siyana Koycheva seems to always be more prepared to defend their bouncers than to listen to their Middle Eastern customers. Being the racist Siyana apparently is , she really couldn't give two shishkababs Unless she proves otherwise.After having a brief online discussion with JJs where I eventually suggested that I could send an anonymous team to record the incidents of discrimination that take place, they couldn't say a word in return because they are very well aware they'd be exposed if someone goes the extra mile to take such initiative."

When we arrived there was a group of South Asian men arguing with the bouncer, the bouncer kept telling them that it's couples night so they can't go in, then he changed his story to ""you have to pay for membership"".Eventually the group gave up and left and we were allowed entrance with no hassle. We inquired about the reason they were denied entrance but we were allowed to go in, they said that we can go in because we are a diverse group, we were also informed that it's their policy, as it's mentioned on a sign hanging on the wall....Mind you, the sign says cultural dress is not allowed and priority to mixed groups, those guys were not wearing any cultural clothes and yes, they weren't a mixed group, however; a group of men who looked different were allowed entrance without even speaking to the bouncer, so we were confused about why those men were singled out.JJ's, reading the reviews here and on TripAdvisor makes one believe that this wasn't an isolated incident, but a backwards and racially insensitive policy of admission. That incident just left a sour taste in my mouth, after that experience we decided to take our business to another pub with the name of Sherlock Holmes, where the band was amazing, food was great and staff was way friendlier and everybody is welcome."

I'd been looking forward to watching the Liverpool / Manchester United match at JJ's, and invited a couple of work colleagues who were also supporters to join me. I wouldn't have if I'd known in advance they wouldn't be welcome there. The guy at the door said I could come in because I looked ""European"" but they could not because they didn't they are Indian and Sri Lankan, but were dressed the same as I was in jeans and golf shirt. In response to a message I sent JJ's on Facebook I was told the doorman was just doing his job, ""working according to the door policy which is framed at the entrance for everyone to see  read it"". Mishmash. I would never support a business with such backward and racially insensitive policy, no matter how highly rated it may be."

Since I have been her I have made two local Bahraini friends. I enjoy pubs and had been to JJ's on other occaisions, so I suggested that we meet there for quiz night. I arrived earlier than my friends and waited at a table until I received a call from my friends saying that they were being denied entry. My friends, one of whom is arab and one of whom is Indian were not allowed in. When I asked why I had been permitted to enter, the boucer told my friends very very clearly, that ""english, americans"" are allowed, but ""arabs, indians, phillipinos need membership"". Needless to say, I paid for the drink I had ordered and left right away with my friends.The overt racism of the staff at JJs is referenced in a number of reviews on here and it is clear that nothing is being done to address it. I read another review in which a representative from JJ's replied stating that they have a clear dress code and that THAT was the reason his mate wearing a turban was not permitted. In my experience, there was no dress code mentioned and both of my friends were dressed in western attire. Presumably management condones the racism of the bouncers if it has persisted this long.I liked the atmosphere at JJs as it reminded me of the pubs at home, but such racism is unacceptable. I suggest that any Canadians looking for a Pub experience that does not exclude people try the Sherlock Holmes Pub in the Gulf Hotel, or really anywhere else. I know that that is what I will be doing and I will also be warning all of my Canadian coworkers to avoid this place as well."

They do not allow entry to any person wearing a turban. I thought we lived in a world where we are trying to be peaceful and treat everyone as you would like to be treat yourself. Well this place is different. They may provide good alcohol and food, but no hospitality and I believe the company is racist."

In short, if you are looking for authentic, traditional German cuisine, you can't do better than Mutter Hoppe's. I have read some posts by Asian visitors who claim the staff is prejudiced against them. Fortunately, I am white and, therefore, can't say with certainty that Asians are mistreated. I can, however, say, with absolute certainty, I never saw any of the staff being rude or disrespectful to anyone. To the contrary, they were extremely courteous and attentive to everyone. In addition, the comments by people alleging discrimination are highly questionable as they usually add claims accusing the restaurant of uncleanliness. Anyone, who has ever been to Germany, knows Germans are absolutely obsessed with cleanliness. The bathrooms in Germany rival operating rooms in their level of sterilization. Germans would never tolerate a dirty restaurant and I assure you Mutter Hoppe's is spotless.In the final analysis, I don't believe Mutter Hoppe's discriminates.

I immediately spit out and called the waiter for a solution. Surprisingly, not a single reaction and apologize from them but only promptly replacing my another ""half draught"" beer to me. Then I complained to their owner how they should deal with it, perhaps at least a oral ""sorry"" even works. Sadly, the owner I feel like rudely told us it is definitely not their fault and even asked me ""which Asian country are you come from You never met a fly going into your beer in your country"". I was breathtakingly shocked. I mean, what the hell and how dare they could speak out such obvious discrimination words as a service provider. This is your restaurant and you should at least responsible for your cleanliness on your food and environment.

I was yelled at by the waitress for not speaking English to her in a German restaurant. For clarification purposes, I am an Asian girl but English is my first language. After we finished our food, the waiter who spoke little to no English cleared our plates and offered us the receipt. We promptly put the money on the table next to the receipt. For the next 15 min, we tried catching the attention of the waiter and 2 waitresses but they seemed busy. The older waitress noticed us gesturing to the receipt and money and walked off, saying ""eine moment"". The younger waitress walked by and I asked her ""can we pay"", to which she sarcastically rebutted ""OH YOU CAN SPEAK"" Obviously affronted, I told her she shouldn't be rude to paying customers who have been waiting for at least 15 min to pay. She then proceeded to give me a lecture on how I ought to have spoken to her in English, when no one in this restaurant has spoken to us in more than a few basic words of English. In fact, I gestured to the bill with a smile quite a number of times  which has gotten me through 3.5 months of patronising restaurants in Europe. This is the first time in my entire life that I have been chided by a service staff on how I should have requested for the bill in English to her in a German restaurant. What kind of service is this After being ignored we get yelled at I didn't want to pursue the quarrel anymore and I actually told her that I would like to just settle the bill and head out. She kept muttering about ""speaking English"" while she returned me the change, and as we took our belongings she kept speaking to the waiter in German. So petty and unbecoming of a service staff. Unsure if she is racist or just really rude, because there are previous reviews indicating racism and rudeness. Other incidents:  We wanted to sit at a table as a group of 3 girls but the staff told us we can only sit at the bar. We offered to sit at a table with one chair and a bench as the tables are rather wide and there was ample space at least a metre between us and our neighbours such that we would not disturb them. We were told off by the waiter who said curtly ""2 people only"".  We proceeded to the counter seats at the bar and ordered a dish each and two beers. The beers were slammed on our table such that the foam dribbled onto our table. Without even an apology or napkins provided, the waitress continued filling up another glass of beer. She used her ungloved, unwashed hand to wipe away the froth from the opening of the glass mind you, that's where we put our lips to drink from the glass and served it to another customer. The only mildly positive thing about this restaurant is that the food is palatable. Prices are not fantastic Berlin has cheaper food elsewhere and definitely, better service staff exist in this city. Do yourself a favour and don't subject yourself to such atrocities. "

Zurletzten Instanz is better in service. The waiter indoor downstairs just looked at me up and down when I asked to a seat, and told me it's fully booked for dinner while there are plenty of empty seats and it was ok 5:30 PM. When I got back to the terrace outside, the waiter there just told me to take any seat I want. I felt like being discriminated by my Asian face. "

I am a woman in her 30s of Oriental appearance and whilst waiting to be served, a group of 56 guys sat at the bar proceeded to say 'Ni hao' several times to me. Unfortunately a lot of people don't realise this but that is incredibly racist, ignorant and offensive. Disgusted by their behaviour I told them that they were being racist. They confirmed their lack of intelligence by questioning my statement. They probably also didn't even realise that their unsought for and unwanted attention directed at myself was harassment. I told them that they looked at the colour of my skin and ignorantly decided that I was Chinese rudely oblivious to the fact that I could be, for example, Thai, Japanese or Malay or English or French for that matter!, and their treatment of me with a sweeping generalisation was racist. I turned away to ask the bar lady for a drink and she insisted on knowing why I was upset, which I presumed was out of concern. I explained that the gentlemen a generous description had been racist. They then had the audacity to deny that any of them had said anything to me at all, including 'Ni hao' and I responded by telling them they should at least be man enough to admit what they said. Now, I understand that the bar can't be held responsible for the antisociable, disrespectful behaviour of their patrons. However, I couldn't believe it when the bar lady then proceeded to tell me that if I was going to be upset by that, then I should be the one to leave! In complete disbelief, I checked that I was hearing things correctly by restating that I'd been the one subjected to racist rhetoric and asking if she was suggesting that I should go, to which she responded affirmatively and then switched her attention to serve the person behind me!Even though I wasn't a victim to any aggressive or violent racist behaviour, that doesn't mean that how I was treated was acceptable, and condoning any level of that behaviour creates divisions and tensions in society. To be clear, I wouldn't have expected the pub to throw the group of men out because, to be fair, they weren't being abusive or violent, merely ignorant. But a decent human being would have told me to ignore them and then served me a drink. Instead she made me feel like the one in the wrong, the one making trouble. If that's the attitude of Connolly's staff, I would strongly recommend staying away from such a disgusting establishment that has no respect or care for people subjected to racist and antisocial behaviour."

Almost every item on their menu is overpriced even the simple things like the pizza. Not only is the food overpriced, but it tastes about the same as something you can get from a Super Market such as Wegmans. Not only do they overcharge but they are extremely racist! I was sitting in this restaurant with my wife and children, and I could constantly hear racial slurs, and many more offensive insults. These racial slurs mostly came from the kid who checks you in ""Alessio"", offending Blacks, Hispanics, and Jews. If you are looking forward to being overcharged for a below average meal, and receiving horrible service and then on top of that, overhearing these racial slurs with your wife and children, then this may be the place for you. Otherwise this fast food joint is utterly disgusting. I would recommend the Wendy's down the street over this RACIST restaurant!"

I came here tonight with my family for my nephews 8th birthday. Food was very average but other than that we were having a good night until towards the end we noticed a disagreement occurring by the bar, between a man and the staff. We were unsure what the disagreement was about but we heard the man say he was going to wait until the police turned up. One of the members of staff approached our table and informed us that they were refusing the man and his wife entry because they had been in before and not paid previously. We thought this was fair enough until we overheard another member of staff say to the man 'no you specifically have never been in and not paid'. It turns out the man and woman were travellers. The police arrived and the man explained that he was being discriminated against because he was a traveller. Whilst the police were talking to the man and a few members of staff another member of staff approached our table again. She explained that they were not going to serve them because they hadn't paid before as the other member of staff had done. My partner asked if she meant that couple specifically and she said yes. To which my partner questioned why the male member of staff had said he'd never done it before. Her response to this was 'well travellers are all the same anyway aren't they'. Clear discrimination. What she didn't know and what made her ignorant comment so redundant was that my partner is actually a traveller. In complete shock, he responded, 'I've sat in here all night, paid, acted respectfully  am I the same'. She laughed in his face and said 'well you're not a traveller are you'. Very humiliating and unjust that my partner has had to go through this tonight. Needless to say the police did absolutely nothing, even after my partner explained and then several of my family members explained what had happened, as witnesses. It truly saddens me that we live in a society where this discriminative behaviour is deemed acceptable. I for one will definitely not be eating in this establishment again."

Horrible food.,"Other than the terrible food and hygiene, I must say I am shocked and appalled by Buffet Fevers staff. Ive never bothered to write a review before but I would like people to know what kind of people run this establishment. I was in there tonight with my partner and her family for a childs birthday party. A young man and wife came in and the staff met them at the door and refused them service as they were an ethnic minority and they did not trust them. The young man was clearly insulted by the situation and the discussion was heated for a brief moment. The man calmed and called the police. In the meantime one staff member said that this young man had been in there before many times and caused no issues. When the police arrived they all said that this man and his wife had been in there many times without paying and the police escorted them outside. Moments later the manageress Of this restaurant approached our table to discuss what had happened and stated that the real reason they wont let them in is because They are all the same and we dont like them. They then denied saying this despite the fact that our entire table witnessed it. Horrible food. Horrible place and horrible, RACIST staff and owners. Disgusting behaviour"

I asked for the manager, and he was not professional, looked down at us, and were treated in a rude way. Never in my 15 years in Dubai and in any hotel group have a seen an attitude like that. In the end I asked for his name, and he declined to give it, first he said he doesn't care if I am a customer or Not, and he doesn't want to give his name. When he found out that I was serious, he became scared to talk and just ignored the situation and said need to give his name out. What a manager! Contrary to the night manager at the Sheraton Mr. Radu, who was kind and professional he made his call and the name of that rude guy was Ian Riddick.Customer service is what differs a place from another, and Ian had none of that."

My 5 star rating is for it for the pub aspect. As a restaurant I would give it less but I don't really eat there. But the burgers are presented nicely, a friend of mine likes the hand made pies, and Chicken Wing Monday limitless buffet is cheap and popular. I think the chips/fries are oven chips.This is a nice, busy yet relaxed, unpretentious pub in a central location. It has a very large array of familiar drinks to choose from apart from Guinness. Check out times for Happy Hours, sometimes a pint costs as little as 5.50 CHF  a real bargain in Switzerland. It won't win any prizes for haute cuisine, but the food looks good.This is a big pub with lots of seating. If you see the seating is reserved just check out the time slot, it may well be free for several hours. The place can look a bit dimly lit in the evenings but it has a nice happy, chatty atmosphere with a nice mix of Swiss and nonSwiss. As a fairly regular visitor for football or an evening rendezvous spot, I have not seen any trouble or fights in the Nelson pub. The music can be loud for some people when there is a DJ on Thursday to Saturday late evenings which I don't like but you get used to it after a while. Staff are quite friendly, patient and efficient, speaking German and English. If you want to get quicker service go to the serving hatch area near the entrance. It is a good place to watch sport ask staff and they will usually try to show your match if they can. Door staff are erm ... door staff so don't expect them to be friendly. I would like to say that a couple of reviewers have said this place's door staff can be racist. The door staff are not white guys. I am a white guy and I have been given the excuse in the past that I can't come in and needed a membership. But these times I was on my own, possibly already had a couple of drinks and the place was already very full with more men than women, It is frustrating but you can just go somewhere else or text your mates to talk to the door staff. Simple. Maybe the staff are misunderstood, their English is not so good. They should just say, ""No, we are full. Please go away""."

Would never again under ANY circumstances consider coming back here and I hope conscientious members of the community won't as well. Add on one of the other people in our group said they previously tried to bring a guest who was visiting from another country here. They had their passport but they still weren't allowed in because the doorman said the passport ""could be fake""."

The security men denied this and the male members of our group were told to pay the admission fee of 3 each.The security man then asked for I.D from the Asian women in our group but not any other member.There were eleven of us all together. Five were male.Only two of our group were from Asian descent. They were 37 and 34 years old respectively and would not normally be asked for I.D.To any other person observing they would not have been mistaken for under 18.I was really disappointed in the lack of professionalism from the security staff and the direct discrimination we experienced.It made us feel uncomfortable and humiliated.This is direct sexual discrimation; that is unlawful under the Equality Act. As well as arguably racial discrimination which is also unlawful.I have complained directly.Vert disappointing.

The restaurant was more or less empty with perhaps 45 tables of customers. After we were seated and read the menu, I raised my hand to catch the attention of a young waiter walking by to order our food, but he pretended not to see us. I called out and he came. I said I wanted to order, then he went away and when he was seen again he was walking in another direction instead of taking our order. Then I called out to another older waiter who displayed dismissive and impatient attitude. He came over and said what's the problem can't you see I'm busy. We explained we had been waiting but no one appeared to want to take our order. The older waiter gave us another earful and said it's just 5 minutes and we've ruined his work. AT that moment we stood up and tried to leave. One other older waiter came and tried to stop us but the other impatient waiter still kept speaking rudely. We finally left. 5 minutes of waiting is acceptable in a busy restaurant but not when the restaurant is almost empty and the waiters were walking around. It is hard to believe it is not due to the fact that we are Asians because we saw the couple just seated before us having their order taken very quickly. This is a very upsetting experience and gives not only the Schuhbeck a bad name but also the city of Munich. Utterly disappointing."

I agree the service was appalling and the lady who served us was very patronising. I think some of the comments about racism are true. If you are white/English I think you may get a better service. Also I noticed the restaurant are only responding to the good reviews on here.. wonder why! The only positive thing I can say is the vegetarian curry I had was fresh and full of nice spices. On the other side... the atmosphere was dead. Nothing there at all to promote a good restaurant vibe. Best word I can think of to describe this is 'akward' and 'uncomfortable'. The lady who served us was shocking. She was so patronising and rude. I've never experienced anything from a restaurant before. Everything we asked was a dig back! She poured us a Coke glass right in front of us from a 2lt bottle that you can get from a cash and carry or super market.. and then charge premium prices for a glass, from a bottle I know could be worth 12! The icing on the cake was when they mixed the vegetarian starters with meat. Whole point of ordering veggie food is to keep it separate from the meat. I'm a vegetarian and DO NOT eat meat at all, hence why ordering a veggie dish. I shouldn't have to explain this! Then the lady server had the nerve to say all you have to do is split the two and put another plate! After much debate she agreed to bring us a fresh plate of veggie food. What an unnecessary situation! They clearly did it as the meat dish was so small of having 2 pieces, to bulk it up to look more  mixed with the vegetarian This lady server also kept arguing with us when we only wanted to order a couple dishes to share. After explaining we were not that hungry 5 times and wanted to share she just couldn't process it and kept arguing saying that's not enough. It's our choice what and how much we want to eat!The nann wasn't proper nann. Looked like bread. And the prices you pay are not of quality or quantity for what you would expect. After debates and arguments on each situation, we finally quickly ate and left. It was so awkward during the meal as we felt like we got told off and couldn't talk or say anything. We just quickly ate and left. There are better Indian restaurants around in Malta. Don't bother with this one!"

Extending stereotypical notions and racial behavior can only take you few miles before people start realizing who they are dealing with.

I wont say the food was bad it was ok but the behavior of the staff was pathetic. This restaurant is run by a Pakistani family, could see two ladies and a guy. Firstly, as soon as we entered and waited for some staff to direct us to a table, this lady with a grumpy face showed us the table and immediately took away the cotton napkins in front of us as we took our seats. Then, the guy came to take our order and when we asked to bring napkins, he gave us the tissue papers. There were two more European couples in the restaurant and they were provided the cotton napkins. Secondly, it took more than 45 minutes to get food on our table. Later, when we asked us to pack the remaning food on the table, she handed us the packet and left. Finally, the worst thing, we asked her the reason why we were not given the napkins while everyone else was. She said we dont give them to Indians or Pakistanis customers because they do not use fork/spoons and spoil our napkins with their dirty hands. I am Indian and It was really disappointing to experience such racist and stereotypical behavior. Thus, I hated this place would be an understatement."

We had initially provided a 20 euro note to the waiter, more than sufficient to cover the 11.20 euro charge, which he refused for an unknown reason, demanding exact change, which we did not have. The waiter reached into my purse to return some extra coins I had tried to give him, and then threw the change from the 20 euro note onto the table instead of handing it to me, our waiter made us feel unwelcome and was very rude to us during payment. When I fumbled for change, he sneered a comment in German under his breath that was directed towards us and was quite clearly derogatory due to the tone of his voice and the look on his face. While neither my partner nor I speak fluent German, I understood enough that he was suggesting that we were unwelcome at your establishment and should instead be at Starbucks. I cannot imagine why, other than rudeness or perhaps racism towards foreigners, that the waiter in question would have addressed us in this way and acted so inappropriately.

The waitress on the door was perfectly pleasant but we will not be back and do not recommend this coffee house to any tourists who want to feel welcome in Vienna."

The host was not available so we sat down in the restaurant, looked at the menu and were ready to order. The host came to our table after about 10 or 15 minutes. I thought he was coming to take our order considering we were there for a while, instead we were asked to leave. We were told the restaurant was full and reserved. There were plenty of tables empty. How can it be full when we are already sat at the tableWere not asked to wait while they check if they could accommodate us or if there was any waiting time for tables to clear. The host was rude and his attitude leaves me to wonder whether we were kicked out simply because they didn't like the fact that a black person was in their restaurant and considering the other reviews I wouldn't be surprised in addition to the racist tone that was displayed during our visit. Also, my husband's uncle has been in there a few times with no problem but the moment he brought a black person he was asked to leave when there were plenty of empty tables with no reserved sign on any of them. My rating is solely on the service and treatment we received as we were asked to leave before we could order so I cannot rate the food. We ended up eating at Florentin House nearby, a much more welcoming establishment, while trying not to let that cloud our last night in Tel Aviv. Definitely wouldn't spend my money in Choco Lulu considering how we were treated."

The guy at the dessert counter looked at us and said, ""We're full"" before we even spoke. There were many empty tables, none of which had the reserved sign on it perhaps he thought we were illiterate and blind Asians and when I asked about it, he said that every table will be full in five minutes. Of course, this was not true. We walked around to check out some other restaurants and came back to check  the tables were still empty. We ended up just grabbing drinks and appetizers at Murphy's which had the reserved sign on some of their tables, but accommodated us so we could get a nonsmoking table inside and called it a night.

We were like OK maybe we just ordered sandwiches that didn't require any forks to eat with. After we finished my wife got yelled at for throwing baby diaper in the trash pale in the bathroom.

We were highly recommended by my other colleague to visit this restaurant but was extremely disappointed after our experience  it ruined our whole time in Brussels. We all had the absolute WORST experience ever at the restaurant  the food , the service  everything was just awful and left distaste in our mouth. The food was mediocre at best with some truffles on top. But the worst thing is that the owner and chef of the restaurant, Luigi Circirello is condescending, arrogant and above all a racist. I am Canadian Chinese and English is my first language. I was with 4 other Americans, 3 of them Caucasian and one other Korean American. First as we sat down, the maitred was very snobby to us and arrogant maybe they thought we were young we are all in our early to mid 30s professionally dressed as we came right after work  and will not spend a lot of money at their restaurant. Then later another short man in a grey suit came over to help us which I later found out is the chef and the owner of the restaurant Luigi Cicirello I should have known since his face is plastered all over the dining tables with his cards. When we started ordering the food, as my team was not that hungry and I have some dietary restrictions we did not order that much food each a main course but one starter to share. We wanted to share the starter but then the chef went on to say to me in a very condescending tone  This is not Chinese cuisine, you cannot share a piece of seabass you will destroy my food!! The first time he said it to me, I let it go as I am Chinese Canadian. However he mentioned it multiple times that this is not Chinese cuisine in the most offensive, racist and condescending way as if I have never eaten any western cuisine in my life and I was some poor peasant never ate at a nice restaurant before!!!! I have travelled all over the world for business and pleasure and ate at many fine dining restaurants and never once have I had some make me feel like I do not belong at this restaurant because of my race and age. My colleagues who are Caucasian were appalled and wanted to leave the restaurant immediately because they said they cannot even enjoy this meal after this incident  we all felt very uncomfortable and upset. However, I wanted to take the high road and told them its okay  we wont cause a scene and we will eat quickly and after we leave I will tell him how offensive and racist he was. The food took forever to come and was extremely salty and was an extreme disappointment. However, the most appalling thing is when the racist owner Luigi Cicirello came to serve us our food, his actions were even more condescending not only to me but to all my colleagues. First he had to teach my one colleague how to eat his crab risotto which actually tasted like Chinese sticky race according to my coworker  how ironic I didnt know he was serving Asian food at his restaurant , he picked up the fork and almost fed my colleague as if he was a 3 year old child who never ate risotto in his life. Secondly, Luigi Cicirello started singing a song to my other colleague as if he was making fun of her cause she was American and never had truffle before! Then lastly, when he came to me, the Chinese comments came up again, I ordered the black truffle ravioli and he said, you do not eat this like a Chinese dumpling implying that I have no idea how to eat a ravioli and only ever ate Chinese food in my life, he picked up my fork and knife and cut it up and said here this is how you eat it not like a Chinese dumpling. I was fuming mad that that point and could not hold back anymore, so I told him I am very offended that you keep on making these racist comments and that Im Canadian and I know how to eat my ravioli. He then half heartedly apologized. Throughout the meal he did not have the decency to come check on how we were doing because he can obviously tell we were upset and mad. He did send over some free desserts but the coward did not even have the courage to deliver the desserts himself. The maitre D finally came over to give us the check and he was only nice to us as I was paying. I do not understand how this can be a Michelin star restaurant as the food is not good at all and the restaurant owner is racist and condescending to his guests. The only nice staff in this restaurant was the girl server/hostess and the older man who served us water. I would highly never ever recommend this restaurant to anyone and my other colleague who recommended this restaurant to me felt terribly sorry and was appalled at my experience there. Ive never felt racism in my life until I came to this restaurant in Brussels. Absolutely disgusted."

The food was off, and the confederate flags everywhere are just plain offensive. It's hate not heritage and doesn't belong in a restaurant. The whole place is a bit sad, really. I spoke with the owner about replacing the flags with southern decor, and he was incredibly defensive and unwilling to have a conversation about it."

We were a part you of 2 adults and 1 kid. There was hardly a customer inside the restaurant and that was kind of alarming.The chef and the staff standing outside to welcome people.They explained the fixed price menu.So they made us sit inside and the staff handed over the a la carte menu and then the owner  Kumar emerged from somewhere.My husband inquired about the fixed price menu and he got really aggressive and grabbed the menu from husband's hand and asked him to go out and read the menu.This was an unnerving behavior. We have travelled to over 50 countries in the world and have never come across anyone in the hospitality industry to be so rude and aggressive. We chose to ignore his behavior and placed the order for us and our son.My 5 year old son was sick on that day so we ordered rice for him.He could hardly eat anything so we asked them to pack it and requested for some sugar that I wanted to add to the rice.We live in the US and were visiting HK at that time.The son was weak after throwing up and I let him eat some sugar with the spoon from the sugar bowl.He didn't take the spoon inside his mouth.This Kumar guy suddenly infuriated and all worked sternly ordered the staff to take the sugar bowl away.His staff obeyed the command.Then, the tea that my husband had ordered arrived and per Kumar's instructions the sugar bowl never came back to the table.When we were done with food and were ready to pay the bill my husband calmly explained to Kumar that his behavior was unacceptable , rude, arrogant, unnecessary and aggressive. Despite spending 7080 USD on food that day.After hearing this, instead of being apologetic, Kumar got severely aggressive and started screaming and shouting.We told him his restaurant will close for good if he continued with such a negative attitude.The total experience was bad.We realized that Kumar was a big racist and behaved in such a manner with the Asian / Indian people. He wasn't rude to another White customer who was having the fixed price menu there."

Rude, Racist Owner","I had a very bad experience at this place. The owner, an Indian, was very rude from the moment we occupied a table. He looked at his staff and said ""Inka order lo and inko chalta karo"" which means ""Fullfill their order and ask them to get lost"". I didn't pay much heed then because I didn't know what he was referring to. We are light eaters and eat only what we like. Our total bill for 2 people was 154. We wanted to order dessert, but then we just wanted to get off the place after the rude comments and bad service. Food at Mirch Masala is just OK, but the owner's rude behavior leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I guess, the owner doesn't like Indian guests or he wants them to be in a big group which means more business to him."

We a group of 5 friends went down and stayed there for 15 mins. Then, we wanted to get more drinks, and it was my round so I went to the bar. I waited for around 10 mins and I was the last on the queue. When it was my turn to order, someone an English guy got in front of me so fast but before he ordered his drink, I told the barmaid 'excuse me I was before him' and he looked at me and said 'yes he was before me'. But for some reason, the barmaid called the security and at that time my friends and I were trying to explain what happened when the security arrived. I asked the guy who went in front of me to explain to the security that I was before him but by then I was pushed out of the bar and told that they wanted to talk to me outside. I explained to the security guards what happened but they told me to leave. I asked why They told me I was 'on the wrong'. I explained to them what happened and asked them what they meant by 'being on the wrong' But they pushed me and my friends and told us to 'move'. The security people were very aggressive and didn't wanted to hear what we wanted to say. I have never experienced such degrading treatment in my life. The reason I think this happened to me is because of my background. I cannot explain it otherwise. I was there as a customer and did not in any way cause any trouble nor was I ever aggressive towards anyone. I could not understand what I was treated in that way. To the barmaid who called the security: you have no right to destroy my night! The guy you chose to serve before me told you that I was before him and it was my turn. Honestly, I just don't understand why you called the security. Shame on you! The reason I am writing this is I am so angry because of the treatment I and my friends have received and you have no right to make me suffer. To the management of The Three Crowns, I was going to spend around 60 on drinks and because of your racist stuff I was not able to. In a place like Stokenewington, I think it is a disgrace that you employ such idiots and bigots. Can you inform the public what will you do about this appalling incident"

Our party was very respectful of their facility and spent a small fortune. We walked by a time later and my pregnant wife asked to use the bathroom the lady immediately recognizing her said they were closed. The only problem was they were open for another two hours and dozens of people walked in after she left. Having worked in tourism for many years its Bizarre to me that an establishment that lives on tourism would be so blatantly racist and callous towards its customers. There are plenty of nice places in Rothenburg that I suggest you try before going to these very EVIL people people.

If someone had approached me as I entered the restaurant none of what took place would have happened.I found a table big enough for all my family which included my children and grandchildren. After approx 5 mins of waiting at the table for the rest of my family I was approached why a waiter who informed me I couldn't seat there as the table was reserved. I replied that there was nothing on the table to say it was reserved and that I needed a big table, this was the only one that was clean and big enough. He said I'll get the manager who had no customer service what so ever. He told me again it was reserved and that I must move. I replied when you have cleaned a suitable table I will move. He then said he would call the police which I thought was totally over the top, I am a 56 year old grandmother and no threat to him, in the end he said forget it I am not serving you. At this point the party arrived who the table was reserved for, they were all coloured young and loud mouthed, I am not a racist person in any way I must add my 2 grandchildren are mixed race. By this time all of the restaurant could see what was happening, my daughter arrived who could see I was distressed and said to Simon the manager I feel this situation has racist undertones and to my shock he said yes you are right, with that we left. Later that same day my son in law called the restaurant to ask if he could reserve a table for the same day and was told they do not reserve tables at weekends, kind of contradicts what Sinon had said. All in all a very bad atmosphere in this restaurant and if all Nandos are the same I will not be visiting again.The following day which was the Monday I called Nandos customer services and explained what had happened the following day I called for an update, it is now Friday and have heard nothing. In case anyone reads this from Nandos my reference number is 53790 live to hear what you have to say."

If you have to chase someone screaming I'm not racist before they have even called you a racist, you're probably a racist. Also, the food sucks, but the racism is a bigger deal, ya knowStrike 1 Our party of 6 arrived and asked for a table and the manager goes ""well, your little friends points to table of black patrons over there moved tables around and that's strictly against policy"" blahblah and ranted about another group moving tables. We then were like ""well, can we have a booth"" and he goes ""I don't know if you all can fit in there"" and we were like ""ummm ok"" and then he goes ""well, I do have a high top for 6 inside"". Sir, then why wouldn't you start with this Why would you start ranting about another black party to us when we are just asking for a tableStrike 2 Our food had not yet arrived yet and I saw that 2 of my friends had actually just arrived and were sitting by themselves. I walked over and asked if they would like to join us as we had 2 extra spots at our table and the manager sprints over before I even have the chance to finish asking them and starts immediately SCREAMING IN OUR FACES. He starts by saying that ""your little friends have been fg my servers over all day"". Again with the ""your little friends phrase"". We all know that he meant ""the other black people in my establishment"". He continued by saying ""you two sit right back down you aren't going anywhere"". I was in shock. If groups are paying and tipping, then how is this ""fg your servers over"" My friends explained that they hadn't even been waited on yet and he responded with ""I don't care"". I retreated back to my table in shock. I asked our server if I could speak to a manager and then I was like ""or was your manager the one who just berated me"". She explained that the reason that he was upset was because other black people had been adding onto tables earlier in the day which messes up their system because they are on a rotational system. I told her that that policy while annoying is understandable and said that my qualm was not with the policy, but how I was SCREAMED AT as if I was a dog who just peed on the floor. She never proceeds to bang on the table and scream ""I CAN'T TAKE THIS ST"" and storms off. I was very confused as none of us raised our voices at her and we were all very calm. Strike 3 The manager comes storming out of the kitchen and screams ""WHY THE FCK ARE YOU YELLING AT MY SERVERS"". First of all, no one was even close to yelling, we were being nice to her. He then screams ""WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME I'M HERE"". Well, I had wanted to speak to a manager to complain about his behavior, but since he was the manager, that plan was off the table. I responded with ""I don't know"" since I was caught off guard with him being the manager and then he responded with ""well, let me know what you want when you can actually think of something""condescending am I right. I then asked why he yelled at me like he did and he again repeated his sentiment that ""your little friends have been screwing my servers over all day"" and I asked ""why do you think that we even know them"" and he responded with ""let's be real here. those were your friends, I saw you waving to them"". Sir, what Are you imagining black people waving to each other at your establishment That is bizarre. I then stated ""not all black people know each other, you know"" and he goes ""OH MY GOD I AM NOT A RACIST"". No one said that you were, but we sure as hell were all thinking it. If you have to scream ""OH MY GOD I AM NOT A RACIST"" when someone calls you out on racist behavior, you might actually be a racist. At this point, the entire restaurant was watching this man embarrass both himself and the establishment. He then stormed away and our subpar food came outStrike 4 As we were suffering with our nasty food, our waitress then stands by the soda machine bad mouthing our table. She honestly had no reason to bad mouth us as we were nothing but nice. I was very nice because she seemed very emotionally fragile so I made sure to keep a nice tone with her. Maybe that's just the culture Strike 5 As we peacefully left, the waitress and manager chased us out while screaming ""WE'RE NOT RACIST! BYE!"" while making obscure gestures. The manager pretending like he was throwing money on us like we were strippers.As I was boarding the plane, a white woman came up to me and gave me a hug and went ""no one should ever be spoken to like he spoke to you. I'll give him an awful google review for you"". Yes, there was a diversity conference that weekend in New Haven so yes, there was an increased amount of POC in his establishment, but no, not everyone knows each other. Currently waiting to hear from Phillips as they are owned by the same franchise according to airport staff who said that this is typical behavior"

Wow! In all fairness to this establishment, they have great food and wine, and their service is just superb! There won't be a next time for us, though. We may not be white, but we are still paying customers, like their white customers. A simple nod would have sufficed. But no! This Italianlooking boss in a suit  tie obviously does not think much of tanskinned customers. What an experience!"

Great Drinks... But Racist Bartender,"Just been to Dante Bar tonight... have to say its a great bar with great atmosphere...and superb choice of drinks especially for Gin Lovers... The service upstairs is also is good... But the downstairs section of the bar even though nice, had a completely different attitude towards serving customers....Despite waiting in line at bar to get drinks, upon out turn the bartender marked in picture refused to serve us drinks as he mentioned the bar was closed downstairs. despite us waiting over 10 min, while he was serving the other customer. The worst part was after we left the bar area... he continued to serve drinks to others another group of 4 at the bar ... which I felt was completely unacceptable .... as this is was not fair practice on the part of the bar.... Although the bar is great, I feel that it is needed to treat all customers fairly ... I hope the management realize this and react upon this comment... I have nothing to say to the bartender ... who for some reason did not want to serve us ...I hope the management will rectify the situation"

My fiance and I walked up to the bar on a notsobusy Saturday night, and my fiance was racially profiled within the first minute of speaking to the bartender. He is a HonduranAmerican person of color, and the bartender, who might also be the general manager, is Caucasian. He is also from New Orleans, born and raised, and so am I I'm VietnameseAmerican, not that it should matter in 2018. We'd never been to this place before and only went there to meet friends from New York who had dinner reservations there. We stood at the bar and noticed a tray of shots behind the bar that honestly look like they'd been sitting there all night. When the bartender finally gets to us, we jokingly say ""We'll take that whole tray for 40."" He immediately responds with ""This isn't Mexico, you can't haggle prices here."" I'm not sure what world he lives in, but it is a racially sensitive time for any person of color. For someone to work on Bourbon St. and come across all walks of life on a daily basis, you'd think the bartender would pick a better choice of words, especially considering the large Latin community in this city, and especially considering he is a WHITE man speaking to a BROWN man. Naturally, my fiance immediately responded with ""I'm not Mexican, don't come at me with that sht."" The bartender starts to tauntily wave bye to us as he walks away, never allowing us to order a drink. Once outside, security asks us what happened, we tell them their bartender is racist, and without hesitation another Saints and Sinners employee says ""He is racist! We had to kick out 6 people last week because they wanted to fight him for being racist."" Ummm... and he still works there why And this is their general manager! The moment we told our friends, they rallied to leave immediately with us. Another manager tried to remedy it by inviting the group to go upstairs, away from the racist bartender. I think they scrambled so quickly to do this because my friends from New York, a wealthy group of 12, had already spent a pretty penny there earlier for dinner and VIP passes. Needless to say, we will never be returning and will never recommend this place to anyone. I shouldn't have to deal with racism in my own city in front of my tourist friends. They might want to invest in some HR and hospitality training, especially when owned and attached to a celebrity's reputation."

This place is managed and run by complete and utter racists. My wife who is black was with her friend who is white for a girls night last night and was told by the security guard or whoever is at the door that they weren't taking anymore black people. WTF Are we still in the 1960's I understand not wanting the thug types to be in your establishment but this is not the case at all. My wife is very presentable and classy and the fact that she was with her friend that is white makes me question this even more. Its not like she was in a group of all black people, just the two of them. Not that a group of black people should be a problem in the first place. I rated this establishment all 0's because you at least have to be allowed in to even determine how the food, decor, service, and cost was. This is the kind of crap that makes black people hate white people. I have many good friends that are white but it doesn't matter what year it is, black people will always be stereotyped as being ghetto, ignorant, and problem causers. So blacks, if you are even considering going to this place, don't because you will be turned away. I'm sure if they could post a sign saying ""No Coloreds Allowed"" they would post it with pride. If black earned money isn't good enough for these people, go spend your money elsewhere. For all the white people out there that know and have good black friends, don't go to this place out of respect for them. My wife's friend was appalled that she was turned away and vowed to never return. Let the protest begin............."

On 29 June 2015, after a pleasant stroll by the embankment we decided to go to 'Belyye Nochi' restaurant for coffee. We chose to sit inside the restaurant, rather than outside, since it was chilly and noisy outside with a majority of people smoking. We were four, 3 Russians and I'm asian. For starters we ordered coffee, to warm ourselves from the chill, and planned to have dinner a bit later. The waitress who took the order, wasn't pleased at that. We asked her to leave one menu, so that we could decide on our dinner order. I was browsing through the menu and was pleasantly surprised to find the menu translated into English. We were served our coffee. The coffee was cold! Meanwhile, one in our group popped a candy into her mouth, and offered the others, while we were deciding on our order. This waitress rushed towards us and rudely said to stow the candy away. We readily obliged and put the candy back into the hand bag. We had barely begun to drink the coffee, when this waitress returned and gave us the bill, not bothering to ask us if we were ready with our dinner order. I was shocked at her behaviour. To add to this, she stood a short distance away and gave me the worst racist look, that I'd ever encountered. We hadn't finished our coffee, when she came back to our table and asked us, whether we are ready to settle the bill. I was absolutely aghast at this. We decided enough was enough, and not to have dinner. I took out my pen and wrote ""Bad Service, regrets only"" on the paper napkin and enclosed it with while settling the bill, along with a not so generous tip for the rude waitress. I could see her pondering on what was written on the paper, since it was in English. She collected the folder with bill, money and the paper napkin. She then showed the writing on the napkin to another waitress. I could see from their expressions that they couldn't read English. On second thoughts, I feel I should have written it in Russian too! We left after the unpleasant experience to head elsewhere for dinner. I'll rate this restaurant as the worst in Sochi. The service is poor, the waitress was rude, ill mannered and racist. "

If you're a Person of Color i.e anyone else but Caucasian you will be treated in a second class manner Trust me, I'm not exaggerating, I got treated this way so did a young couple with their child. If you're Indian don't even think of entering. If you do, the waiter or anyone there won't bat an eye. They wont welcome you or even look up at you. If you're with friends who are basically Caucasian in y case both my friends are Australian they entered behind me after parking the bike, immediately the 2 waiters went up to them, biggest smiles ever, inviting them in and asking where they would like to sit.. When my friends sat fown where I was sitting, the waiters were shocke one looked like he saw a ghost. They didn't come up after that untill we called them about 20 minutes later. The order was 1 Vegetable Momo's 2 Butter Naan 1 Daal 1 Beetroot Shake 1 Ginger Lime Soda. It took about 45 minutes for the Naan and daal to arrive another 15minutes for the momo's to arrive. Unbelievable experience and the food tasted just average.

So we decided to give it a try on a pleasant Saturday afternoon. We landed there for a buffet lunch which is quite cheaply priced at EUR 7.90. It is just a couple of blocks away from our place and we reached there at 14:00hrs. Though the buffet timing is till 14:30, still the moment we stepped in the waiter told us that the counter will close sharp at 14:30. I told him we still have time, he looked at his watch and then let us in. It seemed that he was really displeased to have us as his customer. The restaurant was deserted, there was only a guy eating his meal and this very rude waiter. We started serving ourselves and I took a bowl to take some raita, and the waiter said ""don't use these bowls, since they are for soup, you can take that on your plate"". I apologized since I knew he was trying our patience from the very beginning. The bread was served at the table and on asking for another serving the waiter said ""with buffet we serve only 1 bread per person, if you want more you will have to order"". By then, my husband had already taken too much of his bad attitude and therefore he just asked me to quickly finish my lunch, so that we could leave. At the billing counter the waiter said that the swipe machine was not working and that we pay by cash. My husband asked him to try once and it worked obviously. Well, I guess the waiter was extraordinarily behaving badly so we never return. Congratulations! We will never return. Also, my kind advice to the owner is that if you don't want Indians to eat at your restaurant, why don't you just write it on the board outside ""Indians not allowed"". The kind of business you are in, you can't afford to be rude with your customers."

Strangely when I asked the waiters they were laughing around for few mins. One waiter just passed us as we are not there and another one came to us after few mins. The first waiter then served our drinks to only to European wife and not me an Asian. On our way out when we wanted to softly and politely complain of such racist behavior is unacceptable, specially not by a waiter in this business. I was told that I'm stupid to complain and the second waiter who serve us the menu was super arrogant while saying this. We were refused be introduced to the manager of the cafe. There was no apology or even accepting that they serve my wife by going around the table taking the extra effort not to serve me. I was siting with my back towards the corridor while my wife was sitting on the other side of the table. The picture shows the waiter who deny serving me. Got me to think, where is the culture of people here. Whats wrong for being such selfish stupid behavior of people and then why people are so racist.I have far less Neanderthal DNA in my body than any of these racists and arrogant people, yet they think i'm the less Human being."

On 29 June 2015, after a pleasant stroll by the embankment we decided to go to 'Belyye Nochi' restaurant for coffee. We chose to sit inside the restaurant, rather than outside, since it was chilly and noisy outside with a majority of people smoking. We were four, 3 Russians and I'm asian. For starters we ordered coffee, to warm ourselves from the chill, and planned to have dinner a bit later. The waitress who took the order, wasn't pleased at that. We asked her to leave one menu, so that we could decide on our dinner order. I was browsing through the menu and was pleasantly surprised to find the menu translated into English. We were served our coffee. The coffee was cold! Meanwhile, one in our group popped a candy into her mouth, and offered the others, while we were deciding on our order. This waitress rushed towards us and rudely said to stow the candy away. We readily obliged and put the candy back into the hand bag. We had barely begun to drink the coffee, when this waitress returned and gave us the bill, not bothering to ask us if we were ready with our dinner order. I was shocked at her behaviour. To add to this, she stood a short distance away and gave me the worst racist look, that I'd ever encountered. We hadn't finished our coffee, when she came back to our table and asked us, whether we are ready to settle the bill. I was absolutely aghast at this. We decided enough was enough, and not to have dinner. I took out my pen and wrote ""Bad Service, regrets only"" on the paper napkin and enclosed it with while settling the bill, along with a not so generous tip for the rude waitress. I could see her pondering on what was written on the paper, since it was in English. She collected the folder with bill, money and the paper napkin. She then showed the writing on the napkin to another waitress. I could see from their expressions that they couldn't read English. On second thoughts, I feel I should have written it in Russian too! We left after the unpleasant experience to head elsewhere for dinner. I'll rate this restaurant as the worst in Sochi. The service is poor, the waitress was rude, ill mannered and racist. "

Main reason was because a local wanted our table and we seat before and she went to them in Spanish complaining. He came to us saying table was reserved when she arrived after us: so they ignored us for a long time and we end up to give up and gone to next door restaurant which was more friendly, better service and the food was delicious.

Immediately the waiter rushed out claiming he had charged us for the wrong pizza that was at a higher price than what we ordered and got. The feeling i got was tgat this was an intentional mistske. I was charged Rs 100 service charge tgat either was never on the menu or hidden well in the menu so that punters not notice it. So, in my opinion, racists and cheats"

Run away while you can!","This restaurant is absolutely terrible. The food wasn't exceptional, the ambiance was decent but what really got to me was the lack of service and the deliberate mistreatment of Indians here. Sounds unbelievable, but when we entered the restaurant, we were the only Indians there, the reasons to which we found out the hard way.The waiters were deliberately rude to us, but did some serious bootlicking of the foreigners at the restaurant. They asked us to get off the towels placed on the seats placed there so that the seats don't get wet as the restaurant is on the sea front because they did not want to 'DIRTY' them, although the foreigners were given towels. It sounds childish, but was appalling. The management didn't care, and our complaints were not taken into consideration. We couldn't leave as it was quite late at night. The waiters misbehaved with the foreigners too. We observed one of them stroking a customers back and neck as he tried to 'pacify' the woman for his complete and utter lack of understanding of the dish that was ordered. It was nauseating. The place has a great view, but so do the other dozen restaurants on this beach. I would recommend that you go try them. The food and service is infinitely better. This restaurant put a serious damper on my holiday, and was the worst possible ending, to an otherwise perfect day. If you want to suffer through humiliation, anger and worry about the state of the human race and this country, THIS would be The place to go. This place needs to be shut down, it's not worth a dime and honestly, it's not something anyone would want to go through on a holiday, or in fact, EVER."

This was the worst dining experience ever and I would not be surprised if we were given other customers' left overs. After waiting 15 minutes for the wait staff to begrudgingly serve us, we finally ordered a mixed plate that came out after no exaggeration 1 minute. That is not normal even for McDonald's. Stale, soggy, cold Lebanese bread lined the base of the plate with strange smelling meat placed over the top. Usually, in any normal Lebanese restaurant, the chefs place the meat and it cooks over hot coals freshly. I politely brought this to the attention of the waiter who maintained rudely that this food was fresh. He finally took the plate away, perhaps to spit in it and my friend and I made the swiftest dash to the closest exit and it was the best decision of the night. Of course, other customers who were of the same faith and culture of the owners were given preferential treatment and Westerners are chop liver. This place used to be great but has taken a turn for the worst. If you're a Westerner, you will be treated like the scum of the Earth. It was made obvious by the wait staff that they were ignoring us and taking their sweet time to even take our order. The plates were slapped down on to the table not to mention the waiter was spraying a plate with windex and a chux next door to us. Looking around, the plates were dirty, cutlery was unclean, glasses were cracked, dirty floor, sticky dirty floors, and tables with left over food. The people who run this place give the decent Lebanese population a horrible name. Do yourselves a favour and eat anywhere but here."

On the last two occasions we have been horrified at the hygiene and customer service of this place. On this occasion, we walked in and were not greeted. Instead we were scowled at and then reluctantly were asked if we wanted a table. When looking around, we noticed that there were dirty dishes stacked on tables, filthy decor and furniture and an unswept, putrid floor. After waiting 10 minutes to be served finally a waitress took our order. She was rude and was not welcoming at all.  Unbelievably, within in one minute our food arrived. We were suspicious immediately. Our first instinct was that the food was not fresh and had been microwaved. Secondly the Lebanese bread was wet and soggy and looked like leftovers from previous customers.  When we questioned a male staff member, he was rude and rudely repeated, 'it's fresh, it's fresh'. He then walked away and then finally came back and took our place away to replace it. We took the opportunity to leave.  Warning.... Never eat here. The worst place.

No sign, no explanation. I went to get money out and when I came back I said ""sorry, was that 30"" And I just got looked up and down like I was stupid, before the guy yelled ""YEAH"".I also got served behind people that came in after me I was the only nonlebanese person there. When they realised the order was for me, they said something in Arabic and took my food back before returning it a minute later turned out when I got home there was less food than last time when I ordered the same thing... but probably more spit, who knowsAll in all, they should have a sign out the front saying white people aren't welcome, because it certainly felt that way.

Even when the restaurant isn't even all that busy. Plates are slammed down on the tables, menus thrown down with such force that you're physically startled by the noise. Well in the case of our last visit, we weren't even given menus, we were unable to flag staff down and in the end had to line up at the front desk to then say ""Hi we've been waiting 10 minutes for menus"".This was a recurring theme. Same event for Table water ""Hi, we've asked your waiters for another water 4 times already"", same event for serviettes, cutlery, cups and tea. Also when you do finally get service at the front desk its usually very assertive and aggressive, no ""can i help you"" more""NEXT"" and ""WHAT"". I was also not very fond of when I was next in line and then the woman at the desk looked beyond me.. to serve the Lebanese people behind me. If I didn't have my entire family as witness noone would have believed me.Ive often wondered whether it is a racism thing. Ive come to Jamin1 5 times now the food is too good and every time have been more and more convinced that the aggression in service must come down to that I'm Caucasian in appearance only, I'm actually European.As I said earlier the food is terrific, albeit a little pricey. HoweverDon't get a banquet. Just don't. Basically, how much food comes out is at the discretion of the kitchen staff, the amount we got with 4 people on one visit was exactly the same given to 7 of us on our next visit, except we paid 75 extra. The banquet states that every individual person should get one of everything, but this isn't the case.Overall, I probably would have a 6th visit in future.

My son had brought in a water bottle in from the car, and she came over and yelled at us, as if we had intentionally tried to not pay for drinks while picking up our pizza order.

I think it is disgusting how some people can throw around such derogatory terms like ""racist"" without any evidence. I truly wonder if those looking to be offended at every turn truly realize that when they see someone that is not their own skin tone and assume that they are racist because they had an allegedly poor experience  that makes THEM the racist... Second, Vetro is owned by Italians. I think people would do better to learn American history and recognize how Italians were oppressed when they came to this country as well. One of the largest public lynchings in American history was of Italian Americans. Yet, they're going to be prejudice of Indian people or create a business that is ""racist"" Use your head. Third, I have been to Vetro probably close to 60 times. There is always a very diverse group of people at the restaurant and just the other day we joined tables with a fabulous black family that were regulars and had children around the same age as ours. We had a BALL. Amazing how fun people can have when they aren't looking for racism everywhere....Fourth, I have had or been to birthday parties here, baby showers here, breakfast with Santa here.. The list goes on. The staff is always super professional and food never disappoints. Ever. If I was ever in a poor sitting area or asked for anything, they always willingly complied. Prices aren't cheap but they aren't exactly hefty either yet the portions are fair and there's always some for leftovers the next day! Anyway, I figured I would give my two cents since I love this place and I cannot stand when others are so quick to judge. I don't think they realize how their words can have a huge effect on someone's business and livelihood. People would do better to think more rationally before jumping online with wild accusations and insults. The world would be a much better and less ""racist"" place."

We were seated by the far corner of the wall by the kitchen so every time a waiter passed they would bump me because my back was facing the doorway. Our waiter didn't seem very interested in serving us and had the audacity to circle a handwritten 22 tip amount on our bill!!! We felt like outcasts and had the feeling that it was a very prejudice place as we are both of Indian decent. The price for the food was ridiculous compared to the very small amount of food served. We both don't eat a lot but believe me the amount of food served wouldn't fill a 5 year old child. The food was not cooked properly and tasted very bland. For a very small portion of food and two glasses of cheap wine the bill came up to almost 300. I would never recommend this place unless you are white and rich.

The racial appropriation and commodification of asian culture is unbelievable for todays society. The food is mediocre at best. Maybe in the early 2000s this was an acceptable restaurant, but its 2018!The place is an embarrassment for Paris. The staff is overchallenged which is not their fault. They have all tried their best to placate the disgruntled customers however its really down to the establishments over ambitious admittance of guests. Weve waited for half an hour to get our table and then the nightmare unfolded. The restaurant is so understaffed that it took 30 minutes for bread to be even brought to the table. And after waiting for an hour we sampled our starter, the Kong Plate  it was in fact just a pair of spring rolls, low quality negiri and a sad ceviche. At this point McDonalds sounded like heaven compared to this torturous anticipation for more mediocrity. McD least it wouldve been hot and quick. We decided to cut our losses and actually order McDonalds XD. We canceled our main courses and asked for the bill. It took 10 minutes to get the waiters attention and then another 10 for the bill to arrive. Followed by another 5 minutes just for the card machine. Im actually impressed at how understaffed the restaurant is. The efforts of the 510 waiters serving two floors of dinner guests is commendable but the management needs an complete overhaul. Who in their right mind would allow this to happen And the concept of the restaurant is impossibly distasteful. Also they need to take down that ceiling fresco. STAT. "

This cant be paris i have been traveling to paris since young! Last time i was there was almost 5 months ago and ppl. Were not that friendly but this time i grew a bread and came and i was denied to order a sandwich on my table was told hv to consume it at the bar so stood at the bar and was eating decided to order tea with food and asked the guy working over there is it possible to drink the tea while being seated so the guy refused he said same u cant sit. Then asked if there was wifi he said yes and asked for the password he didn't reply re asked for password he shouted i am coming although he was infront of me and placed the password paper roughly on the bar. So i finished and on my way out i saw ppl. Drinking and sitting i asked them did u eat a meal or just ur drinking tea and coffee they said just tea and coffee so meanwhile the waiter was clearing nearby tables and i told him here they are sitting he told me that i was complicating matters and told me bec. I ordered a sandwich and had to eat it at the bar so i answered and said well but i also ordered tea and asked u to be seated u said its not allowed. What is that What if i ordered tea then sandwich later while drinking my tea u will tell me drink ur tea at the table seated and sandwich on the bar While speaking he left and he was cursing in french. So i went to the police told them the story!Came back wanted to meet the owner and waited for an hour and a half and he the owner meanwhile works there started shouting Infront of everyone as i showed his college the complain and he knew the complain.

We asked which one  the music didnt sound all that great either and the guard could not name the Dj  he just said a Sri Lankan Dj. We said we will buy drinks at the bar, let us in or charge cover but the guard did not budge. We were about to leave when we saw 4 white guys walk in and they were not even asked a single question. We asked why were they let in and the guard tried lying by saying that they stay there. It was very clear he was lying  when we pressed him further he said south Asian guys have to pay. We asked why  he simply said thats what the owner has asked him to do and theres nothing much he can about it. Needless to say, we didnt want to go to such a place so we just walked off. "

When we arrived, the waiter told us that all tables were reserved, although ALL the tables were empty. We went there at 8:30 PM and were asked to come back at 9:30. That was ok, but we saw the guy seat a white couple without reservation. Anyway, we gave him benefit of doubt and returned at 9:30. We ordered Dal Makhani and Aloo Gobhi. When asked how spicy we want to food  we said 'Indian spicy' i.e how Indian food is served. However, the waiter suggested that meant 4 on a scale of 5. sure, we said and placed the order. The food came and had no taste at all except for red chillis. When we asked to make it better  the waiter said that it wasn't their fault since we asked for 4/5 spicy on a scale of 5 which was his own suggestion. he took it back after much arguing and brought it back after adding some water in Daal and gravy in Aloo Gobhi which was otherwise dry.We however, paid and went back.While, we had a bad experience, my husband wanted to get some Indian chicken for himself so we went back the next day again. On seeing us at 6:30 PM, the waiter said he had no table available for today  again when all the tables were full. he then said, its only take away. We decided to order two dishes and just when we were talking to each other  he announced that just the dishes we were going to order were not available. No panner and channa masala. That's 4 dishes out of 6 in his menu. Its a horrible place and brings Indian food and hospitality to shame. Don't bother with the food either. It's just bland."

I visited with 3 other Indian friends. When we reached there, the restaurant was maybe half occupied in capacity. We asked for a table and they said all tables were reserved. Fair enough.Since we really wanted Indian food, we placed a take away order. As the person taking the order realised that the bill was going far north of 450500HRK 6070 he said to us, ""Since you have a big order, I give you table inside"" The ""inside"" looked like the back of a dingy storehouse with a sheet for a curtain. Look at the pictures. Now, the food. The dal makhani was not creamy, it was spicy. The mutton rogan josh tasted only of tomatoes and had 4 tiny pieces of lamb. For a dish that expensive, they ought to at least give a couple of more pieces. The chicken biryani has brilliant reviews so we decided to try it. Again, over cooked chicken in red chilli paste. No aromatic spices, no yogurt raita along with it. Plain disappointing.Total bill was a little over 80 and two of my friends had an upset stomach the next day. Totally not worth the hassle and insult."

As soon as we walked in and the owner saw us, a family of Chinese and when I asked if we could be seated to eat in, he immediately said in French very rudely that everyone must eat. We have 2 children so I wanted to confirm whether the kids would each have to order and he said yes. He says if you want to take out you can order less but if you want to sit down everyone has to order. The food around champs lyses is not cheap so for such an expensive crepe, and we all had to order one was a little unreasonable. If he was nice explaining this rule then thats fine but he was extremely rude. We decided to leave and not eat there.

However, after seeing me the waitress showed somewhat awkward behavior and just said to wait a minute, and went to the back and whispered something to a man, probably the manager of the restaurant. Afterward he came and told us in a very arrogant way that they were fully booked, although it was quite empty and late for dinner time! We were very confused, but later learned that he didn't let us in because I was asian. Also, when we passed by the restaurant again after eating elsewhere to return to the hotel, we saw it was still quite empty, which confirmed that the Osteria Della Corte had actually lied to us about being fully booked and just didn't let me in because they were racists.

I was passing by with a friend and thought of giving it a try now. We got seated in a quite corner all front side of the restaurant was seated with a few tables and looked lively, no asians there though We found it to be weird for us to be seated separately and in a corner but were in a good mood and didn't bother. After starters we had to wait a good while for someone to notice us and take order for the mains. One waiter came forward to change our plates but then the waiter who sat us down called from behind and asked the waiter in Bangladeshi not to clear our dirty plates. This guy was just about to clear our plates and got called of. We found it weird again and gave him the benefit of doubt and didn't say anything. When our mains arrived, it was to be given with a portion of salad. The waiter bringing us the main was arriving at the table and had salad in his hand as well I could clearly see from the mirror in front of me but then gets called in Bangladeshi mention salad something..... and he then turns back and leaves the salad at a desk and brings out mean without the salad. We could very clearly feel the racist behaviour by the waiter who sat us down and was consistently displaying to us his lack of motivation to serve us. That was it, I had to go and speak to the manager. The manager understood and apologised for his behaviour, to which I asked the manager that it wasn't the manger behaving in a disrespectful and racist manner, it was the waiter looked like the head waiter there to which the manager asked the waiter to apologise but to my surprise he just disgracefully walked away without saying anything. There was clear negative attitude in his behaviour. I am surprised how a Bangladeshi waiter can be racist to an Indian  Nepalese origin customer! It was a shame to see this behaviour from them. I have come to a conclusion that they believe English customers would leave them good tips and hence their difference in attitude towards different customers. I dine out often and always appreciate the service, even if it's not up to mark because it's busy. But it's the first time I experienced such disgusting racist behaviour in a restaurant and will surely not go there again. The food was good. The ambience was good. The managers effort was good. Just 1 racist waiter spoilt our evening "

The proprietor laughed it off, gave me another deck of cards and made excuses for the racist actions of his fellow. I was shocked, didn't know what to do. While I was collecting myself, a fellow customer asked me if he could use the chair beside me. It occurred to me to ask him that, seeing as how it is the proprietor's values are not to share one deck of cards out of two, perhaps it's wrong for me to share his chair. He smirked at me. This racist exclusion values was a joke to him too. I was so upset I went up to the counter and said that I had to leave. The proprietor forced me to pay for the food I had yet to eat and threatened to call the cops. So I payed. I'll try and put a stop on my credit card if possible.

I could see by the expression on her face she was going to say no to us when a lady in chefs clothing stepped out from the kitchen and smiled at us and said of course. She then began to assemble tables together to accommodate our group and was clearly put out by this. I then realised that 2 of our children were asleep in buggies so we didnt actually need the final table that she was manoeuvring into position so I thought I better tell her. Before I could finish the first word of the sentence, she interrupted me and told me she didnt understand me.We were then treated to an hour and a half of food and drink being thrown at us literally in some cases, walking off as we were speaking to her, tutting and generally making us feel very uncomfortable. We had to ask for everything at least twice. In the defence of the restaurant, what came out of the kitchen was decent local food but this was completely overshadowed by the waitresss behaviour.The restaurant filled up during the time we were there and none of the other diners received this treatment but got similes and attentive service. As we were the only nonfrench English group in the restaurant, I can only assume that this was because she didnt like English people. Just to qualify this, I have had many instances of bad service abroad but none have lead me to this conclusion. It just amazes me that this person is employed by them, as the lady in the kitchen who must have been more senior to her witnessed a lot of her quite spectacular performance.Reading the other reviews I can see that I am not the only English person to complain about this waitress so in summary, if you are English and want to be made to feel really uncomfortable by a complete racist then Les Aviateurs is for you. Otherwise I would suggest visiting any of the other restaurants in the town, all of which I found very good."

I have also observed that they make it a point to talk and engage with tourists as SG thrives on a large quantum of tourism. Hence some remarks by some visitors of they HL being racist I am an Indian is what I would not agree to. In totality. The staff goes to the extent of remembering your name and your preference for drinks. I would say one should and should not go by these remarks of racism and dress code as club rules apply everywhere! A lot of the regular ones are no the Caucasians. I have asked all my friends visiting SG to go to HL and all who have visited, have comeback with a great and an amazing experience. So i would say, get it in your itinerary for the evenings to go to HL! Enjoy the music, the band performance and have a good time! I am looking forward to it again ..... end April, 2016! Cheers to team HL! Keep you and our spirits high :"

While we were walking around to pick a place for the night, we stopped at Highlander and were asked to pay a cover of SGD 50 per person entry, we decided to check a few other places and decided to go to Warehouse, which is exactly opposite,not only do they charge no cover, we were greeted well and were happy to see a places that understands and posses the art of serving customers well. doesntdiscriminate! We noticed, while we were at Warehouse, that Highlander allowed Caucasians and Asians enter without a cover while every SouthAsian was stopped and asked to pay! No doubt you guys play good music, but good luck with this racist attitude you have, will be really to happy to see you go fullhouse for long with your arrogance and racism.

We thought maybe it is crowded and decided to walk around before we settled down at the Warehouse opposite it. We then saw that this institution allows Caucasian and south East Asians in without a fee while stopping south Asians. Whatever may have been your past experiences it doesn't give you the right to discriminate against anyone.I was shocked and appalled with this apparent sick behaviour. However good your music maybe you people are tone deaf to Customer service.God bless you with the realisation that institutions like yourself will soon be kicked to the kerb.Thank you for the only negative experience we had in Singapore. We now appreciate the good we saw.May you someday see the light.Au revoir PS: The Warehouse actually combines great customer service with your music. Drop by sometime to see how it's done:

We had 3 hours to explore the island and after asking around the locals, Pantelis seemed to be the right choice for lunch.It all started when we sat down and the already illtempered waiter asked us where were from. We answered Israel and he looked at us with a smile that seemed as though he was underestimating us, but we decided to ignore it. We ordered several starters, my other friends ordered shrimp and one of my friends and myself decided to order a 1kg sea bass to share. Not to mention the horrible service and zero smiles we received from the waiters, neither did they bother to take away empty plates or give us new ones. We had to tell them what to do all along the meal.All the dishes except the sea bass had arrived and we were eating and enjoying the beautiful view of Symi. 40 minutes into the meal and still no sign of the fish. We asked the waiters what was going on, and they said it will be out soon. We mentioned that we are supposed to leave with the boat in 45 minutes time and asked if they could please make it quicker.Another 20 minutes already an hour at the restaurant and no fish. The waiters said that it should be out any minute and this was the point where we werent willing to wait anymore, since we were supposed to leave and everyone had finished eating. The waiters frowned and said its coming and we told them that we were not willing to pay nor eat the fish.There is no acceptable reason that a grilled fish should take over one hour to prepare. Not to mention the restaurant wasnt too busy, approximately 10 other tables at maximum keeping in mind we were at the largest table, sitting 6.Finally after 1 hour and 10 minutes after we had ordered the meal, the fish arrived with what seemed to be the manager that had mocked us being Israelis when we sat down who started shouting and saying that we ordered the fish and now its ready and we are going to pay for it. We told him that there is no reason we should be waiting so long, and if it takes over an hour to grill a fish this should be mentioned when taking an order, especially when people have a limited time on the island when arriving with the boat. When the manager understood that there is no chance we are willing to pay the 50 for the fish he started shouting and swearing in Greek, mentioning the word Israelites Israelis in Greek to his colleagues repeatedly.Needless to say we put the exact amount we were supposed to pay, excluding the fish, and no tip for such horrible service. I mentioned to the manager he is racist and his behavior is a disgrace to this island and Greece as a whole.NEVER SUPPORT RACISM. If you visit Pantelis, you are supporting a RACIST and ANTISEMITIC, unfriendly and grumpy staff."

Getting vexed, we asked for the cheque without placing any order for food and they promptly brought it in 10 seconds. Their whole demeanour was thoroughly disrespectful. They never glanced in our direction, ignored us and couldnt care less. Its a horrible way to treat any customer and if this is how they plan to continue, god save them."

The restaurant was completely empty and accommodates approximately 25 covers yet I was turned away. Reasons given were that they did not have any high chairs which I stated did not bother me and that they ""would become busy later"".Perplexed by and slightly confused, I specifically asked if they would prefer that we left and was told ""yes, we will get busy later"". The not so kind lady then opened the door to assist our departure.Why a completely empty restaurant in the heart of London, would turn 2.5 diners away my husband was also going to join us at supper time is beyond understanding. Which only leads me to two conclusions, either they are the most child unfriendly restaurant in London or the colour of our skin was an issue. I am a black woman."

The menu said in Serbian/Montenegrin that people from exYugoslav countries could get a discount on drinks, and we had some such people in our group. Upon asking about this, we were informed that the discount only applied to Montenegrins, in flagrant opposition to the statement on the menu which is discriminatory and probably illegal anyway.We got our drinks and waited more than twenty minutes for someone to take our food order, even after flagging a waiter down. We decided to leave. Before we had even put the last of the coins on the table, a waiter very conveniently dashed out to collect our cash. Im not sure if this delay was rudeness or some kind of racism we had some ethnic minorities in our group and nobody else had trouble being served, but I wholeheartedly encourage everybody to avoid this restaurant like the plague."

Unfortunately I cannot comment on the quality of food, as we did not make it that far.To paint the picture...We arrived for an early lunch at around 12 and were seated relatively quickly and pleasantly. Unfortunately that was the last pleasant thing we experienced.After this we were ignored for about 20 minutes before we were able to order drinks. We were travelling as a mixed group, and some of us were native to the Balkans. The menu advertised a discount for anyone who spoke the language. This is not true! When we queried this we were told it was only available for citizens of Montenegro....Once we had ordered drinks it was as if we had fallen from the face of the earth. Our waiter walked past us, ignored our polite requests and hails. Our drinks arrived after about 10 minutes and were fine. We failed to then order food for about 35 minutes as our waiter continued to ignore us. We are unsure why this was, but we suspect it is because one of our friends is a person of colour and received some shifty looks from the waiter.We eventually paid for the drinks and left and found much better, friendlier service at a restaurant called Bokun  just around the corner."

And I thought French desserts would be different or outstanding, and I, myself, am a big fan of desserts and found it really frustrating well, I also tried other desserts that my friends ordered, didn't change my opinion in any way / Service was good, yet later we noticed that the restaurant put us into small room deep inside the restaurant.....and it was very obvious that they were spliting the white ppl and asians into two different places, more specifically, it luked as if they were hidin the NONwhite ppl in this small room at the very corner of the restaurants. This totally ruined our lunch. And later on wen we were abt to leave, I still politely smiled and waved at the waitress and the staff in the restaurant and only the asian waiter who served our table smiled at us politely and there was this french waitress just gave me dis cocky dirty luk to be fair, other French waitress n waiter were quite nice , I think it was just this one and some other waitress that were quite rude. I dono if it was the restaurant policy or sth to divide the white ppl n nonwhite into different rooms....but totally unacceptable.The Lunch price for the 3 courses was okay compared to other Michelin restaurants we paid around 90euro each for 3 courses with glass of wine n sparkling water, but I'd say it was overpriced in terms of food, service and atmosphere.....I have lived in Europe for 6 years and been traveling to many different places, and I have been to some very highclass restaurants served in courses. I would say any of these restaurants would b granted at least 3 stars if according to Michelin rating. Do not get too overwhealmed with this Michelin star rating....it's more of commercial purpose."

Otherwise there really isnt anything good i can think of!as for the service, i expected to be served by Parisian snobs anyways...which i can understand might be an attraction in itself as where else in the world of fine dining do they not have waiters that can actually speak proper English That wasn't even the worst thing, my friends and I who are all Kiwis but born in Taiwan were the first people to arrive, and although we only did book our table the night before which kinda tells you that they're not that great if they aren't booked up for cheap lunch on a saturday! we were put to the side section of the restaurant which also didnt have any aircon, one of the things i was actually looking forward to at the restaurant! and soon after another group of 4 Asians from China were seated with us in our subsection. This was all well and good, but when i realised that the outside/main/airconditioned restaurant section was not even full but seated with tables of Europeans...that was what really pissed me off. Sure they can give me a reason saying that those were the only seats available but that clearly wasn't the case. Not wanting to play the race card but i really could not think of a reason for them to have seated us the way they did. so all in all, horrible food and terrible service! don't let this place ruin your trip to Paris! If you're after cheap Michelin star restaurants in Paris, look elsewhere like l'Astrance, Pavillon LeDoyen, Passage 53, lAtelier Jol Robuchon, L'Agap or Restaurant Auguste."

The kids wanted to have the kids icecream which is only offered in the Cafe, not togo. Since my friend and myself are witnessing Ramadan and we were fasting, we did not order anything other than this one big Kinder Eis for the kids. There were plenty of free places and it was not a busy time during the day, we wanted just to sit with the kids to have this icecream and leave.The waiter who was obviousy xenophobic and racist, was super unfriendly and very rude, When we ordered, he took the menu away and said sorry I am not serving an Eid for four people, took the menu and left us speechless.Still in shock, I told him that this is not a nice way, and that we are fasting so we could't order  by the way, we didn't mind ordering something to go, and we were planning to give good tip.This is not the first incident that we get very rude and hostile service at this cafe. I will never go to this place again. They hire a bunch of racist and arrogant people."

Proceed with caution,"I headed into the place with lots of expectation going by the reviews which were waxing lyrical of the place, esp the view.I had to come around twice before spotting the entrance as it is hidden inside a antiquity shop. I couldn't make anything out wrt a view as I went in around 8 in the night and it was pretty dark. There are comfortable looking seating options with plenty of cushions to go around and the place was pretty full with only a single row near the river facing side empty. As I went in to sit, a visibly irritated waiter told me that it's gonna take time and as I wasn't really looking for a fast food shop, I gave him a thumbs up and explained that I can indeed wait for the food.At this juncture he told me that I can't sit there as there are expecting a bigger group there. At this point the managerI guess who saw me entering came up to me and explained that I have to leave now and I cannot be accommodated. As it had very limited capacity, I could totally understand the situation and obliged willingly. On my way out, I saw a white couple obviously stumbling in and checking the seating and the manager welcoming them with wide arms and explaining that they can sit anywhere they want. I waited for the manager to come out and he just avoided meeting my eyes which just confirmed my assumption that I was racially profile and denied entry as I am Indian. With a disappointing end to my first day in Rishikesh, I trudged along to the next cafe where I had a brilliant time.I have been in cafes all across India from Varkala to Hampi to Pushkar to Kasol and I have never had such a pathetic experience with the folks who run the places. Being a solo Indian male is obviously an unwelcome trait at Shambala Cafe, but accepted everywhere else.The food may be good, the views brilliant but the high handedness of the management and the obvious racial discrimination is something I pray would be wiped out soon."

Although we were one of the 1st groups there, all those that came after us was seated before us. We watched group after group be seated while our group was never called.My Mom went up to the Hostess to inquiry as to why we hadn't been seated yet and she did not give her an explanation. She did not care. We spoke to the manager who also did not care or give any explanation. The only conclusion we could draw was because we were a large black party they did not care to seat us and did not care about losing our business. Which needless to say, we did leave and have not returned there since. It is amazing to see the Orientals display racism. Here we are in the 21st Century and Racism is still alive and well even among the Orientals."

I am still dumbfounded and left to say WOW! To this date, the management has yet to assist, and they are not listed with the BBB, so my only recourse is to type up a review, and see if the GA Atty General will investigate. I was photographing a large party of about 70 or so patrons one night for a rehearsal dinner. The party ended up being in an overflow section. Well for those who have not been to a Japanese Steakhouse, there are usually two tables with opposing grills. If the seating party is larger, there is an extention on which they will put on one side to join the two tables together. Well there was an open seat at the extention, but our party was sharing with an all white party, and the seating hostess seemed to be determine to not let me sit next to that party. She suggested that I sit at the opposing corner of the table with our group, even though the extention seat was still on our side. I didn't seat, because I felt highly disrespected. At the end of the night, I asked the hostess for a credible reason why she refused to sit me next to that party, and she told me that she couldn't give me a credible reason, and then said that was her last night anyway, and just walked off. I have complained and have still yet to receive as much as a phone call. They have my business card. I can't tell you if this place is good. I know that it was packed and filled with about 6085 minorities on this night. There was many complaints about the service from other parties. I feel its wrong to take your patrons for granted and I cannot and WILL NOT recommend Miyabi's to ANYONE, white or black, not even Japanese.Leighton DaCosta"

Despite the restaurant being pretty empty when we got there, we were showed to a makeshift table right at the back of the restaurant near the toilet and kitchen. The table looked nothing like the other tables and did not have table settings set out.On asking the waiter why he gave us this table, he said it was the owner's instructions. At this point, we almost walked out but since my son wanted to eat Italian badly, I insisted on another table and they provided us with a normal table. I later asked the owner why they provided us with the makeshift table and he mumbled something around not being aware of it but it was not convincing.During the dinner, the restaurant continued to be only about half full and I later noticed that the makeshift ""table"" they had originally shown us was used as a kitchen table where they put food ingredients. Therefore, it was not because the restaurant was full that they put us at that table originally.I can only conclude that they originally put us at that table because we are East Asians and they were discriminating against us. The food itself was good but the treatment left us feeling very uncomfortable and unable to enjoy our meal.This is the first time I have experienced racism so overtly at a restaurant despite having travelled extensively all around the world. From the other reviews, it seems that their normal service is good and not what we experienced so we were singled out for ""special"" treatment.If you patronize this restaurant, recognize that you are supporting a racist owner who overtly discriminates against customers based on race."

Before anybody thinks I may have been dressed inappropriately, I wasn't, I wearing something smart and suitable for an evening meal in a nice restaurant. I must have been waiting about 5 minutes but it felt like a lifetime and during this time I thought ""its busy maybe they haven't seen me or I'm too far from the entrance"" I walked further in and once again got looked at by staff some gentlemen looked like managers and still nobody acknowledged me. Then a white couple came and stood next to me, they were seen too immediately and this is the moment when I realised what had just happened to me! I'm a British Asian woman in my early 30's who has a dark complexion. The couple were asked to come back in 15 minutes and when I spoke up and said I've been waiting too the waitress said ""we are very busy might have table but might not so you can come try later"". I walked away feeling very humiliated, uncomfortable and embarrassed. I and anybody who has ever experienced anything like this should not be made to feel this way! I'm not one to think of anybody as racist unless somebody says something out right to my face, however on this occasion I thought it was important to leave this review as this was clearly racist! I would hate for anybody to experience what I did. I had a wonderful trip to Channia and this was my last night. Shame on the restaurant staff for making me feel this way and I would strongly advise people not to dine here.

Cant believe these places are still run business. And it's 2018.

Seemingly, they open their kitchen for select customers :It looked like the waiters were simply racist or just plain lazy.

Despite showing them my UK driving licence, the three bouncers told me I wasnt allowed in from the beach entrance and I had to go back onto the street and around to the front of the hotel to see if they would let me in, which they did. When we got inside we were charged Rs.375 for a small 330ml can of local larger and very loud music which I think was meant to entice people to come in there were few people in there when we got in at 11pm on a Saturday night and nobody was dancing. If youre looking for a place thats like a crap bar in San Antonio, then this is the place for you. Otherwise Id go to one of the local bars two doors down, order a huge 675ml bottle of larger for Rs.350 and watch the shooting stars while listening to the waves. But be warned, the roaming sky light from the Kingfisher will try to disrupt any star gazing as well.. very disappointed in this place."

The lychee martini and passion Mojito are not to be missed. But we kind of left in a hurry the second time as we took up a bed which had an additional cost of 2000 which we agreed to pay but we were reminded by 3 diff wait staff about it which got annoying. We jus paid them 2000 then which they could have jus asked us to and we would have been happy to then being annoyed by them over and over again. It almost felt like they though we would not pay. So after we paid we complained and they quickly apologised but the drinks took forever and they forgot our order twice. So the entire experience was a little annoying. We didn't stay for food and left inspite of paying for the bed. It wasn't like they were too busy. The night before we came in for late night drinks and were asked to move from a comfortable seating to another and then asked back to move to the comfortable seating if we wanted to We ordered a few drinks but the waiter was too engrossed with the white customers to even make eye contact with us when we asked a local question about the beach. So yes go in there expected to be treated with prejudice if u are dark skinned.

We went there today, Jan12th, around 2:15 in the afternoon and while there were numerous staff looking jobless, not one was willing to greet and seat us. Should have treated this as a red flag but we went ahead and asked one of them if we could sit at any of the free tables to be served. We seated ourselves after receiving confirmation and waited for the menus. After 15 minutes of waiting, one of the wait staff came to us and informed us they were closed and no longer serving lunch. I then informed him that we checked their website which states the place closes for lunch at 3:30 and we had a hungry toddler with us. He seemed not to care and informed us that they were expecting a lot of guests in the evening and hence needed time to cook for dinner! I had him repeat this as I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It seemed like a bizarre reposnse but we figured it was bad luck and started to leave the place. As we were leaving, we noticed the same guy walking up to a 'white' couple who had come after us and started to take down their order. To make matters more interesting, on our way out we also saw one of the staff greeting a 'white' family who had just walked in to the place. In case anyone is curious, we are brown skinned and it took a little restaurant in Unawatuna to experience the 'selfracism' everyone talks about in regards to Sri Lanka. Needless to say this was a disgusting experience and unfortunate after our wonderful stay at the Fortress closeby."

Racist manager. Awful service.,"I came on July 21 for dinner with my American friend at this restaurant. I am 23, visiting from Spain. I have been traveling around California for a number of weeks. Throughout this time, I've been using my National Spanish ID to get drinks as I'm cautious about bringing my passport around. I completely understand if a place only accepts passport, in which case, I'm comfortable looking for drinks elsewhere. My problem with the staff of Crushed, San Diego is the EXTREMELY RUDE and unprofessional way they told me I could not use my ID. Basically, upon receiving my ID and seeing it was a foreign, it was thrown at my face and when I handed over my phone with a picture of my passport, it was flicked across the table. I've never had anyone look at me or treat me like trash the way these people did. One waitress was pretty patronizing and talked to me slowly like I was a toddler, emphasizing that they only accept AMERICAN ids or passports. When I insisted once or tried to explain that all other establishments I've used this ID at had no issues, THEY THREATENED TO CALL THE POLICE ON ME. I was terrified, I couldn't say a thing after that. Again, I understand if I can't have a drink but when they switched over to my American friend they kindly asked what she wanted. They NEVER asked me if I wanted any food or anything nonalcoholic. No apology for the situation, nothing. The waitress just completely ignored me.I have never experienced this kind of treatment before. After all the news in the US about being threatened with the police for no legitimate reason when you mean no harm, I never thought it would happen to me so blatantly. This place needs to reevaluate their protocols and learn to handle customers, especially tourists, with care. Threatening to call the police on a young woman trying to explain herself or asking questions is not the way. SHAME ON YOU.To the owner, I hope you read this and train your staff better."

I am not the type to run the ""race card"" but it was clear we weren't welcome here. I am white with blonde hair and my husband is puerto rican but being a roofer his skin tone has darkened a bit.

And what happened to me was the worst racist servise by a waiter named Raz. He uttered NO SINGLE WORD to me during the service, looking at me with a mocking, scornful facial expression, while he was normal to other customers.I am originally from Japan and was wearing kimono, a Japanese national dress on that day. Another waitress approached me and gave me compliments about my kimono, but apparently Japan/Asia/kimono did not seem to be Raz's cup of tea!Raz continued to avoid my table after placing the bill on my table, so after waiting for good 15 minutes, I stood up and went to the waitress to say I would like to pay. Raz finally approached me and took my card without saying anything of course!. I asked his name and its spelling, and IT WORKED A MIRACLE. He looked extremely nervous and weak, and out of the blue mumbled that he loved my outfit, but too late!I sent a letter of complaint to the cafe, and a manager named Rebecca replied. She wrote that Raz admitted that he did not do enough service to me, and also that Raz said my outfit was 'insane' so that other customers and I could hear lovely extra service!. However, Rebecca desperately wrote that still she believed it was not related to racism or personal dislike by no means! She suggested visiting their cafe again to experience their 'heartfelt hospitality'. NO THANK YOU!!! I am living in London for years, wearing kimono almost every day, but I came across such a racist waiter for the first time. I still can not believe it happened in the multicultural London. I advise you not to go there, unless you love racist lads like Raz, who could kindly judge your outfit with strong words too!"

Warnings to tourists or nonwhite customers: STAY AWAY! READ ALL UNDER 3STAR RATINGS FIRST! If you click on each one, you will see most of the customers who complained about service were either Chinese or Indian. Interesting  isn't itHere is what happened if you are curious. A blonde waitress greeted us and asked if we had a reservation. The restaurant looked empty but she said without reservation we can only sit at a small shabby table.Well we didn't have any objection to that. We sat down and waited for her to come and take our order. It took a very long time. During this time a small fly was bothering us constantly and one time landed on my eyebrows and I was really annoyed. Finally she came and we ordered some crepes and two coffee lattes. When the coffee came among the flies, I was happy and I said ""nice"" since I was starving. The waitress said, ""yeah, and it was very strong coffee too."" I felt weird since we ordered coffee lattes which were not supposed to be strong.The moment I took a sip, it all became clear why she said that. The coffee 5.5 tastes like a combination of hot milk, some hot water, and some regular distilled coffee. The top of the coffee looks like foaming toothpaste and there was absolutely no crema which all espressobased coffee should have. I didn't want to complain about the lack of espresso coffee at this point since we were here for a carefree getaway. Then she came back and asked us how we felt about the coffee. My partner and I both hesitated for 1 sec to comment. I was about to reply ""it's ok"" to the waitress but all I saw was her butt. She cut me off with a loud voice, back towards us and stepping away, ""BETTER BE GOOD!"" We were choked without a chance to say anything.I was quite surprised. I have never given a negative comment before in a restaurant. But this time, I think I'd better tell her that something might be wrong with their espresso machine. The next time she came, I told her frankly that in my opinion the coffee was flavourless. She immediately responded, again in a loud voice, ""BUT WE PUT THREE SHOTS OF ESPRESSO THERE!"" That was a blatant lie.I was really angry and I said I'm sorry but it was at best coffeeflavoured milk, definitely not espresso! She said, again in a loud voice, ""I can bring you some more coffee, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TELL ME!""Now the most disturbing part. When she came back with more coffee, she started to go on and on about how I was rude and I should be nice and just tell her. I couldn't believe my ears and my hands were shaking. I had more than enough and I completely lost my appetite at this point. Being the only Asian customer in the room, I felt it must be discrimination at that point so I called her a racist idiot, dragged my partner out of the restaurant without paying the bill. I barely touched the food but the food was not all that great either. All the bacon strips were sitting on the outside of the crepes which was disturbing for a French restaurant.I have never walked out of a restaurant this way and it was the weirdest experience ever. Now that we cooled down a bit, I would describe this waitress as crazy rather than rude or racist. I won't go back at any point."

While eating, I spilled some chutney on my phone and table and had to use the paper napkin to wipe my fingers and chutney stains on my phone and table. Meanwhile, our starters arrived and we were about to eat our starters, but as my paper napkin was spoiled due to chutney, I politely asked this person, Nadeem, to give me a paper napkin. He looked at us angrily gave us 4 paper napkins. We said we want only 1 paper napkin, but he again looked at us angrily and made a very rude racist comment  I am giving you more because I know this is how Indians and Pakistani people are. They always ask for more napkins where ever they go. This is how all Indians and Pakistanis are. We were absolutely shocked by this racist comment. We are living in UK since past many years and had never been victim of racial abuse. This experience was not only shocking for us but really disheartening.

We all work with customer and have been working in this field for so many years from which we have learnt that customers are always right. Apparently in Nawab Leeds Centre it is a complete different story. On the way to the restaurant for a lovely evening and to celebrate Ramadans eve with the family, we thought it might be a good idea to bring our own cans of coke with us as the coke served at Nawab Leeds Centre is not as nice. My family said we would not have the coke until we asked the waiters if we could do that. When we arrived at the restaurant, we asked two waiters, and they said it was ok for us to drink our own coke. So in return we ordered more starters to compensate the restaurant for the loss of not buying coke from them. After we had the starters and while we were eating the main, a manager came to our table and literally started ranting at us in front of all customers saying: Are you guys actually having your own drinks We are trying to make a business here; do you think you are eating in Bradford It is Leeds here, this is not acceptable. We all thought that he was joking, but he kept on, I said are you actually saying these words to us He replied  do you speak good English Do you actually have the dignity to bring your own coke here I said  I have dignity despite of you I asked two waiters and they both said it was ok. He didnt believe me and said you need to stop giving me this attitude. When one of the waiters was walking by, I asked him and the waiter said he thought we were joking. At that moment, we stood up and asked for the bill, he said yeah come along and pay and leave, when my family were trying to tell him that we didnt like what he was saying and he should not have approached us like this, he kept talking over them and kept emphasising on the fact that he was the manager. We paid for the food but we didnt have it and left him the coke that we had brought with us, then we went to Kashmir restaurant in Bradford, which was very nice, cheap and very very friendly. We will never go to Nawab Leeds Centre ever again, even though we were regular customers and always paid tips for the under paid staff that were shouted at by that manager so many times. I did not like the stereotyping and the racism in that mans voice, who under rated and judged us and humiliated us in front of everybody for no reason at all and accused the people of Bradford of being something that they are not, whereas we were paying customers who did not do anything wrong."

The original owner, who was indeed an unrelenting racist, retired some years ago and died last year. The generation who now runs the business is disinterested in politics. I certainly understand that the stain of the old man's rants and outdated beliefs would make some stay away he was quite the nutjob, but I saw no evidence of it recently in the restaurant. There were many black families among the patrons and the staff was about 50 white. Personally, I'm tired of reliving the civil war, I don't want to pass those scars onto my mixed race grandaughter. But on to the food! I moved to South Carolina from vinegar based barbeque heaven also known as eastern NC, so this mustard based barbeque is a radical change. And I love it! I've eaten SC barbeque 10 or so places and liked this one the best. Yes, sometimes the sandwich has too much sauce, but just ask for it on the side. The barbeque is pit cooked, same 24 hour process which has apparently been used for many years, and it's really high quality...no gristle, very little fat. Other items like fried chicken on the buffet are pretty good too. Overall, good value for the , but I can't get past the fantastic barbeque!"

It's average sauce and the BBQ itself is often soggy with too much sauce mixed in and not of very good quality imo. I have had BBQ all over South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee and this by far the worst BBQ I have had from any establishment. If the BBQ is actually any good, you don't need to drown it in average sauce, you simply use the sauce to compliment it. I am often dragged here by friends and family that like it for some unknown reason. I had a cheeseburger once because the BBQ is that average to me and it was decent but not that memorable. The sides are usually pretty good, especially the onion rings.The dessert is always excellent but not worth the trip itself. Also, it was founded by a total racist who would sell racist books inside the restaurant and fly the Confederate flag outside his restaurant. Eventually, stores even had to stop selling his BBQ sauce because he was such a racist. How is it ever worth supporting that kind of garbage"

However, a few minutes later 2 group of 6 and 4 white ladies, and yes 6 and 4 white ladies were allowed in just like that. I then went back to the bouncer/manager and said 'that's not fair, how comes you just let them in and you won't let us in' The member of staff was so rude that he imitated me and started laughing and his colleagues too were laughing. I been told It seemed apparent that the club had something against Asian. Basically, We wasn't drunk when we were in the queue. Also we were smartly dressed, and the fact that I was rejected just like that without good reason seems to me that the club are racist. I'm Asian and I noticed that a lot of Asian couldn't get in either all were stood outside. My question is, why was I refused entry for no apparent reason The door man was being very rude and kept saying because they are member of the club and this is our house rules and policies.'"

The food is alright, the music is always lively, and the venue is a great spot to catch up with friends. However, a few weeks ago I headed over there to meet some friends on a Friday evening, and was told that recent dress code rules forbid gents in shorts/slippers. I was bemused, as I've been there many times dressed casually, as most other patrons are as well. It's a pub after all, not a high end bar. Anyways, as I waited for my friends outside, I watched the hostess and bouncers reject a couple of guys and their female companions they seemed from the Indian subcontinent, for the same reason. Dejectedly, they hung around outside while making other plans. A few minutes later, three single Caucasian gentlemen, two of whom are in shorts/slippers, walk up to the door, and are welcomed warmly and let in. I was shocked!!! I immediately walked up to the hostess and bouncers and confronted them, obviously fuming at this blatant display of ""selective screening"". Their response Those Caucasian patrons were previously inside, having come in earlier for Friday brunch. So, when I asked what the difference is between someone coming in earlier or later, if there are patrons inside dressed casually at this very moment...they had nothing to say. I offered to pay the brunch entry fee although it was over several hours ago, if that was the case, and get nothing in return. They still refused. After a back and forth for several minutes, I asked to speak to the manager to complain. He came out and tried to defuse the situation, because at that point I made it clear that this was racially selective screening, regardless of dress code or timings or brunch fees. My friends inside came out, having confirmed that there were several gents inside dressed casually, shorts and slippers. The manager continued to try to clarify, but finally gave up and offered to let me in and buy me a drink on the house. I'm not sure what their concept of a man's pride is, but it would be a cold day in hell that I would accept such an offer, having been rejected, insulted, and humiliated by representatives of this establishment. This is Dubai, an Arab that welcomes people from all walks of life, a multicultural melting pot that few other cities in the world can rival. Places like the Stables do not belong in our modern society, especially not in Dubai. Racism will not be tolerated, and that evening a few weeks ago made it crystal clear: Stables does not welcome all. Call it what you will; selective profiling, racism, anti Arab on Arab soil. Whatever. I will not be returning to Stables, and I will make sure everyone knows what this pub represents."

DISCRIMINATION AND OFFENSIVE!!,"Excited to hang out on a Ladies night and have a drink with my friends All of us of African descent we decided to go to Stables just a walking distance from our work place. We climbed the entrance the stairs with excitement, upon approaching the door, the ""Hostess"" immediately ask us LADIES, WHERE ARE YOUR BOYFRIEND'S"" we giggle thinking its a joke so we want to proceed, then the Security says unfortunately there is ""A new rule"" couples only!! Ironically at the same time it is LADIES NIGHT! We tried to explain we work in hospitality few blocks away even showed our company card but he said he cannot let us in unless we have men or Face card. While thinking of a our next plan we stepped away and 2 ladies non Africans walked without being asked anything, we let that pass and few minutes later 2 more ladies as well as Non African went in without being questioned so my friend goes back to ask what is happening and the Hostess said she knew some of them. Every bar or restaurant might have its policy you name it but never has it been on a race! Clearly unless we are missing some detail the blocking was PURELY on RACISM GROUNDS and unfortunately at this Century and in a Metropolitan City as Dubai that would happen. We thought of calling DTCM but things such as DISCRIMINATION comes from within the person. It was HUMILIATING given that we talked to them with all the RESPECT but none given back. And the essence of a LADIES NIGHT is for ladies to hangout together and enjoy each others company! That is why is is called ladies night, so next time you want to use a door policy let it not contradict with your theme of the day! If there was a rating lower than TERRIBLE, it would have best described the situation. I would not advice any of my friends!"

Beware!","I do not know where to begin...I'm speechless. Absolutely the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. The manager of the establishment who is also the head chef even came out to insinuate that American's were not welcomed! Due to his inept management, the third plate of duck I ordered the emperor duck it has 3 different dishes came out to us 1 HOUR later than it was supposed to! Even after the duck was roasted and the first two servings were eaten it took an hour for them to serve the last dish.When we refused to pay for it because we didn't believe it was our same duck if you've ever ordered Peking Duck before you would know that the duck is cut and served three different ways. He became belligerent and made racist undertones in his words and attitude. I didn't even mention that that the duck was already cold and wasn't even that good.He lied and stated that it was our fault for not informing them that we had moved tables when clearly the waitress had known at the beginning that we had moved and where we had moved to. I even brought the waitress out to prove me right and when I was trying to explain to him about his error, we argued and he says he doesn't ever want us back and they don't welcome foreigners like us. We got into a yelling match, the busboy, belligerent chef/manager and other unknown restaurant male staff/posse/henchman starts getting physical. They insult my American wife and claimed I was unpatriotic I'm Asian. All we wanted was a nice meal. I've never been so insulted and shocked in my life over a meal that they had screwed up on.The waitresses were trying to calm the situation but the chef, and various male staff were atrocious with unbelievable animosity towards foreigners. They made it a racial issue when it was clearly their inept service and food that we were complaining about.Their duck wasn't even that good and definitely not worth the USD80 that we paid. I have had much cheaper and better in Guangzhou and Beijing, respectively! Never, ever had such a horrible experience at any eating establishment! These guys give Chinese restaurants a bad name.If I could give them NO rating I would.This is the most unprofessional, poor excuse for a restaurant. The head chef who seems to be a part owner is arrogant, a racist and belligerent."

These people are liars, con artists, and DANGEROUS to be around especially when it comes to foreigners. First, my husband and I go to be seated and they sit us next to the kitchen doors. I saw a row of tables open by the windows and I requested to be seated there. We were told that those were reservation only seating. So, we took the table next to the kitchen door and ordered duck liver, and the ""Emperor Duck"" which is 392RMB. We were told it would take 45 minutes for the duck to be cooked which was fine by us. After we had been sitting and chatting for almost 30 minutes I realized the tables by the windows I requested earlier were still open. We asked another waiter and they said that you did not have to reserve those seats and that they were open. Long story short  after a lot of talking we got reseated where I first wanted to be. Although our waitress was very unhappy about it and tried to convince us to stay at our table. The duck skin came out and they served us at our new table. Yet, they didn't bring us our wraps to wrap the skins in. We had to wait a long period of time so by the time it got to our table our duck skin was cold. I wasn't too happy about that but decided to let it go. Then, we waited ONE HOUR for the rest of our duck dishes to come. If anyone has had Peking duck before  they know that is waaaayyy too long for the rest of the duck to be prepared considering it's already cooked. By the time they had brought it to our table after multiple requests my husband and I were fed up. We asked for the manager and complained. We weren't even sure if that was the same duck we had ordered and it was already cold when it came out. Eventually, after making no headway with the manager  the head chef came out. He was incredibly arrogant and told us ""It's not his problem."" He gave my husband, who is Chinese, the feel that he did not like foreigners I'm American. When I tried to say that this treatment was unacceptable he started slapping his chest and yelling ""CHINA, CHINA, CHINA!!"" so I knew he was a racist. In over a year of living in China I've never seen such blatant racism. By that time my husband and I knew we were going to get nowhere with people this ignorant. After we paid our check my Husband told the head chef that he gave Chinese people a bad name and that his behavior was completely out of line. Then, the head chef along with a few other kitchen workers ATTACKED US!! They literally started shoving, pulling, screaming, cursing  it was absolute chaos. They were screaming at my husband saying he wasn't Chinese  and that foreigners were not welcome in their establishment. Some of the waitresses were trying to hold some of the men back  but they kept lunging at us and grabbing us. I had to keep shoving people off of me and my husband and we kept telling them to get their hands off of us. Some of the kitchen workers were taking off their jackets and screaming cuss words at us  threatening violence against us. Even when we left they followed us downstairs and outside! But, the waitresses and a couple of the men that worked there got in the way and gave us enough time to leave.I have never been treated with such disrespect and hate here in China. These people are the worst of the worst! I'm surprised they haven't had a lawsuit. Not to mention, the food is barely mediocre  the duck skin was not crispy and it was overpriced for the quality you get. There are plenty other Peking Duck places in Shanghai  I would NOT go here if I were you. They will try to con you and will lie through their teeth. They are flat out DANGEROUS to foreigners. When they followed us outside I wasn't sure what they were going to try to do to us. The people that work there are unpredictable and you are NOT SAFE if you dispute your meal. This was just beyond belief....."

We had just arrived in Novi Sad and decided to go and eat at a restaurant with good reviews. We arrived at 9.30PM, the waiter  in his late forties, short black hear  asked us where we came from  we said Greece, although we were one Belgian and three Greeks. Apparently, the waiter does not like Greeks so he started shouting with every order: ""wine for the yunani"", ""water for the yunani..."" The food was really mediocre, but okay, not too bad. This would have just been an average experience were it not for the fact that things went really downhill when we asked for the bill. The bill was 4800. We gave 5000. After a while, the waiter 'asked' if we wanted change, we hesitated a bit  he had really been 100 unprofessional and rude/racist and we should be even given credit for considering it  after which he decided not to wait for our reply and started making a scene, shouting that  because we are greedy Greeks  we can get our 200 dinars back and get the hell out in five minutes, although he had brought us half a litre of wine five minutes earlier. But we did leave, our first positive impressions of this beautiful city scattered by a frustrated racist.I have maybe visited 1500 different places in my life, but this waiter nailed it. My worst experience ever! I felt insulted on behalf of my fellow Greeks. We showed our disgust when leaving the place, but no other member of the staff cared a bit either. The owner was absent.And really, the food's not worth it either. We had, among other things, the 1800 dinar speciality of the house, a really mediocre mixed grill for two. Nothing to get excited about, apart from the French fries.The local red wine was excellent though."

We were in Paris for a hen weekend 10 girls all dressed to impress no tackiness, nobody was drunk all well behaved. The first taxi arrived and some of our party was waiting outside the club they were told the club was full. When we arrived in the second taxi the doorman basically stuck his head in our taxi and said you might as well stay in the taxi and go elsewhere we are fully booked. At that point we were like not a problem we still need to get out to get to our friends and wait for the other taxi to arrive. As we were standing outside we noticed that there were people coming out and said as people are coming out can we not go in as they come out, the doorman said no its not possible the bar was full and there is no room. we said okay fine not a problem but then right in front of us he let a group of people in of the street that just arrived. He didnt ask them if they had a reservation or a table nothing just let them in. we asked him why he let them in he just ignored us and told us to go away and that we should leave the road and take a right somewhere! Finally our third taxi arrived and he started telling us that we had to move on and go away just to get away from the club. By now we had seen other people being let in thats when we realised the problem we were 10 Indian girls hence the reason there was no entry for us. When we challenged this he just shrug his shoulders the other door man must have heard us and said no its a private party well if that was the case where was the guest list in his hand And how comes they were letting people in from the street without asking them why they were thereI dont like to blame anything on racism but this club and there door staffs attitude really dampened our night and the start of our trip to Paris.

Racists are disgusting!!! racist racistplace avoid dontgo prejudice prejudiceiscrimeBelow is what I wrote on their page, it is really close to C21 stores:At this place I witnessed a scene of prejudice today in which a black guy came and asked the price of the pizza/calzone and the attendant an old, disgusting, man  to be specific since there were two working there was very rude, saying that he could not give him a piece of pizza and that if he wanted to, he would have to pay before to receive the slice. NOBODY was paying the pizza before, everybody was eating and then paying, including me and my husband. The attendant was humiliating the guy who kept himself calm and superior all the time I could never do that. Only after the boy showed that he had money, the attendant apologized and then after the guy pay for it he gave the slice of pizza and said that he misunderstood that the guy was begging. When my husband went to speak that he did not like the attitude of this attendant, the attendant was extremely rude, screaming out load again, cursing and driving him out of ""his shop."" Blaspheming for us to return to our country not being an American either. Again being prejudiced, this time with foreigners.The guy stayed there and ate his calzone more expensive and showed to this attendant how superior and polite he was. I am really astonished with his attitude because I would never keep myself in such a place. If there is justice in this world, this racist man will have what he deserves... And he will be treated just the way he treats people. I will never step in this place again and I will tell as many people as possible to do the same.And to the guy that was humiliated in front of a lot of people and kept himself calm and superior all the time, I can only congratulate him, he is the kind of human being that we need in this world."

At first i thought it was because they had reserved a table at an earlier time, but it turned out that wasn't the case. I specificly checked with two ladies who came after us but got in prior to us about their time of reservation, they told me it was 9:30pm.

The food was so so, but I would not give even 1 star for the service, especially the waiter's attitude. It was very hard and took forever to ask for a waiter to our table, and he was always looking away while taking orders or when we asked for suggestions. He gave attitude and raised his voice whenever we tried to communicate. Then when the bill was out, he asked for tips very directly, but we found out that 2 dishes listed were not what we had, but more expensive ones. So we complaint. He seemed very annoyed when we asked to fix that, then he told us to just deduce the money ourselves then pay, without fixing the bill. We found it very impolite and suspicious, so we wanted to check the bill again, cuz we had about 10 dishes in total. He argued and gave us very impolite words, asking us to pay quickly then leave. Then he said ""Those Chinese people"" behind our back, in French which we understood, not to mention all the noise and dishes slamming he made while cleaning the table in front of us. We found it very insulting and and racist, one of the worst experiences we've ever had here in Paris."

Do not advise anyone to go to La Societe or any of its Sister restaurants. Despite us having made reservations through our hotels concierge for a special family celebration at La Societe, we were received and treated with utter disrespect, humiliation and rudeness by the hostesses and manager on duty. Not only did they pretend that no table would be available for us, they also had the nerve to seat another party of Four who came WITHOUT reservations as walkin guests. Upon further confrontation, the hostess had no further excuses and was clearly lying through her teeth. That demonstrated how low the restaurant would stoop and the quality of their staff and work ethic. Left us with no conclusion but the fact that they were racist and unprofessional and not worthy of a single penny spent there. Wish them the worst of luck and hope the restaurant goes out of business soon. As I mentioned to the hotel concierge, we would have gotten better service in a third world countryno doubt. "

We had paid our bill, by his logic, does that mean we are no longer customers! Then he turned to the lady and said to her""What do you expect from a Chinese!"" !

So my friends we're waiting outside in the rain and I showed up with the birthday girl. We're confronted by the 'security guard' and he keeps telling us that the tables are full. To add, he was being very rude and ended up raising his voice at us. I told him multiple times that I had a reservation. I called the woman I was talking to previously on the phone explaining that they're not letting us in. This woman comes and says yeah they made a reservation, you can let them in. The security guard says that he has to check us. He checks one of my friends in such a explicit way, it was absolutely humiliating. He patted down his whole body for about three minutes and asked him to take off his coat and buttoned shirt. I had an English home birthday gift that I had bought and he was holding it, the security guard snatches the gift without even saying a word and starts unwrapping it. I then realized what was going on. My friends are middle eastern and it was obvious that they didn't want them in the restaurant. No one was 'checked' by the security guard except my friends. I took my gift out of the 'security guard's hand and we left and went somewhere else. RUDE, RACIST AND UNCALLED FOR."

Before I go further, I wud say that the food  Ambience is very good but the Restaurant Manage Mr Gazi, needs a desperate lesson in Hospitality!!He was downright nasty, nothing less than a Racist! He insisted we sit in one remote corner of the Restaurant while the entire place was empty as we had reached a little before the 7 pm i.e. opening time. He said to get a better table we shud have booked one month in advance, we later checked with the other customers and everyone had booked merely 2 days in advance, just like us. The fact that we had a booking was informed to him by his team  yet he behaved in this fashion. We fought  managed to get a good table but he insisted we leave in One Hour. SO much so for the Rose Champagne we ordered!Such behaviour is disgusting  smacks of his Xenophobia."

We were a group of four asian girls and had a prior reservation. The hostess gave us a horrible corner table despite many tables in the center. They came up with 10,000 excuses even when we asked them to change. After that, they gave a 4 people table to a couple in the centre. We made a fuss when we realized that they were clearly being racist. It was only then that the manager came and moved us. He himself was asian and apologized. As the evening continued, the service was very bad and the food was just average. I have had much better food at other buddha bars. Definitely not worth it with that attitude. Specially coz most restaurants in Paris are very warm in their welcome."

The first impression when entering the restaurant was good. It's a really intimate place and the atmosphere is nice. However, that was the only positive part of the evening. 1. They refused to serve tap water but offered cut price bottled water for 1.50. This was presented in a jug and was clearly tap water. Charging 1.50 for tap water is not OK2. I asked for a Quattro Formaggi with onions and garlic I LOVE onions and garlic. They point blank refused to add onions and garlic because 'we're a traditional Italian restaurant and we don't want to spoil the food'. I said this was ridiculous because for me, the onions and garlic will enhance the food but it fell on deaf ears. I was irritated but said 'OK, I'll take it as it is'. I ordered in German but started complaining to my husband about it in English because naturally I switch to my native language when I'm annoyed! and the waiter in turn started speaking English back to me.3. They brought out my husband's Pizza and I waited patiently for my Quattro Formaggi. When it hadn't arrived 5 minutes later we asked where it was and apparently, they understood that I said I didn't want to eat anything. I was horrified and hungry I hadn't eaten all day! This definitely wasn't what had happened and I couldn't believe that a restaurant would rather not serve somebody food than give them onions and garlic!4. When I complained to the manager he said he couldn't see a problem and the waiter was right not to give me onions and garlic and it was a misunderstanding that they didn't give me any food. That may be the case but what he went on to say really upset me as it was blatantly RACIST . He said in a very nasty way 'what we need in this restaurant is only people who speak good German'. I am 100 sure he was not only referring to me being an English speaker but to me being black I was the only black person in the restaurant.They were totally unapologetic and had absolutely no idea about customer service. I think it has to be one of the worst service experiences I've ever had. I would NEVER go to a racist establishment like this again. On a side note, my husband decided to take his pizza away and they folded it up so all of the ingredients were touching and soggy! He threw it away!What a waste of time and money!"

Service was very slow to begin with but we didn't mind too much  my boyfriend ended up having to go to the counter and order our food.We ordered one egg roti and one vegetable roti.The food arrived and we started eating. My partner then found a hair in his food after the first two bites. He isn't someone who likes to make a fuss, so he was willing to ignore it and carry on eating. He then found a second hair, at which point I felt really sick and stopped eating my food. Again, he didn't want the hassle of confronting anyone and waiting a long time for more food to arrive, so he pulled it out and tried to carry on eating. He then found a THIRD hair in the first roti  he hadn't even eaten half of it at this point. I took the plate up to the counter and told the waiter what had happened. He refused to believe me. The cook then came out and said I must be mistaken. I told them it was disgusting they were serving food like that and then accusing customers of making things up, and they became very rude to me. I said we would not pay for our meals, as we had only eaten a few bites and didn't want to continue eating because we both felt really sick after what had just happened. One of the waiters said we had to pay. I stood my ground and said we would not be paying for such a terrible meal, and he then began to raise his voice at me, along with the other waiter. The other waiter also then decided to throw casual racism at me by saying ""you must be Indian"" The staff in here must've been in their mid 30s, but were acting like little boys. It was really embarrassing to watch. I've never had such a terrible experience like this in any restaurant in my life. Considering we came in here two years ago and had a good experience, we were extremely disappointed with how this restaurant seems to have gone downhill.I cannot recommend this place to anyone, I can only recommend you stay away."

It was terrible, incompetent service that bordered on racist. When we arrived, we were kept waiting for someone to get us a table but no one seemed too interested. They were cleaning and so we dismissed it as an honest error. We were finally asked to sit outside and the waitress came to take our order. She didn't seem fluent in English so we had long exchanges trying to understand one another. I noticed her sniggering as members of our party tried to pronounce some of the dishes. We weren't born in Italy so instead of sniggering, I would have liked her to help us pronounce correctly. But again, we didn't make much of her poor manners. We were terribly hungry and put in orders for our entrees. After waiting for 45 mins, there was still no sign of our food nor was there any communication from the staff. We went in and asked for an update where our waitress gave us a lethargic ""they are cooking"" response rather than try to expedite our order. Then she came in with 2 of our entrees, apparently it takes them 45 mins to make pizzas. We were really hungry and devoured our pizzas in 15 mins. Still no sign of the remaining entrees. We went back in and checked about the status of our remaining orders. The lady at the counter seemed clueless as she thought we ordered only two entrees. She asked our waitress about our order and sure enough, it said on her diary that there were 4 entrees. At this time, it struck our lovely waitress that hasn't put in our remaining entrees order to the kitchen. She told us that ""she forgot to inform her colleague"". At this point we just gave up. We cancelled our remaining entrees and asked for the check. Then they proceeded to charge us for 3 entrees!! It was terrible, incompetent service that bordered on being racist. They clearly didn't want brown skinned people at their cafe and I will be sure to take my business elsewhere for our remaining vacation in Rome."

When we asked the same waiter why the next table could order a meal and we could not  he rudely answered the other customers were an exception and walked away without another word ! Clearly he implied he was not interested in our business and was not willing to serve us!! In my opinion the attitude of this rude waiter is a very racist  the other customers were 100 Europeans!!!

I complained to him but he confirmed that we had to leave and made some racist remarks about us.He was clearly racist and didnt have any hesitation to show it.I told him that I will write a complaint about this to Maredo's management but he said that I should go ahead and write a nice piece sarcastically. It seems like this company is lead by racists who belong to the Nazi era.To be honest it no longer seemed to be Maredo's steak restaurant, it seemed more like walking out of a third world butcher house with thugs running the place.

Also, when we asked to look around the bar, which we had read a lot about, especially the 11 rooms, we got a similar reaction. They were worried we'd not pay and said we can't see the other rooms. Racism and discrimination at its peak. To the student community, especially Erasmus exchange students, beware of such inhospitable behavior."

Is good food worth that,"Absolutely appalled at their service. First, when we got there, we werent sure whether to seat ourselves or be seated so we asked and looked liked wed irritated them by doing so. Sit wherever the table is free.So we sat, no one came so we thought wed get the menus from the front ourselves so by the time the waiter came, wed know what we want. Again, glares. Then, the worst part. Totally ignored as other tables were attended to. They were white. Was this intentional Well when we got up after being ignored and raised why wed been ignored, she didnt say anything.Then another male waiter literally walked right past us everytime we tried to talk to him. As if we werent even there. It was shocking. We spoke to a table who had white but also two people from other ethnicities there about how theyd been treated. Rude and they were slow to serve them, we were told.Heres the thing: youre a country that gets a huge boost from tourism. Dont discriminate.And even if you want to stereotype, no one deserves to be ignored like they werent even there. Shame on you.And if anyone wants to feed their racism by continuing to visit this place, well, thats disappointing but your choice."

She kept saying 'pourquoi' why in french and shaking her head. I could see that her behavior was making the other guests uncomfortable.Eventually, she just shrugged and pointed to the worst table in the restaurant, right by the entrance, even though most tables more than 10 were empty. I am pretty sure they weren't reserved since it was already quite late for dinner. She kept avoiding us when we wanted to speak to her again. After several minutes when we managed to ask for a different one, she got aggressive. We left.I have heard that french restaurants can be discerning about their clientele. This wasn't the case here.

We then wanted to pay at least the wine we had out of respect and he, still laughing and mocking us, asked us how much tap water we had as he wanted to make us pay for that.While talking to other people during the discussion with him we realised that the experience has been bad for them too.

To make the experience special I had called and made a reservation. As this was over the phone,the person who took my reservation asked me if I would like a cake as well. I inquired about the cost and was told it was complimentary. On double checking and getting a confirmation that it was free i proceeded with asking them to proceed with it.When the bill arrived I was surprised to see a 50 Euro charge for a cake. I politely asked the waiter and told him how they mentioned over the phone that it was complementary. Several fine dining restaurants around the world offer a similar service at no extra cost hence my surprise over the cost especially since I double checked it was for free.A few mins later the owner of the restaurant came over to me and started screaming at me publicly in front of the other guests saying I was a liar and a crook and threatened to call the police on me as he insisted there was a 50 Euro cost to this and denied that the restaurant had told me anything about it being free. He proceeded to tell me never to come to the restaurant again, that he had my contact details with him because I made the reservation and that he would tell the whole town that I was a crook. I was in complete shock about being publicly insulted for something that the restaurant confirmed to me twice that they were now completely denying. How can someone like this get away with publicly insulting someone and falsely accuse them. I ended up paying the 50 euros because He literally threatened me in front of my kids and they were terrified. He then followed me to the street screaming after me shouting racist abuses in French even after I paid the amount.Please do not go to this restaurant. No one deserves this treatment and false accusations from these crooks. He ruined a completely special day for us. I have never encountered such treatment anywhere around the world in a restaurant. Do yourselves a favour and dont go there. You dont deserve the arrogance of this rude and obnoxious racist individual who doesnt care about his customers and breeds hate and racism."

So I looked at him and asked him if he was telling me this because I was female, sitted alone and I was black He stammered and said no, so I said OK if it makes you feel better here is 2500 Rubles can I have my drink now.

I guess my good sense should have told me that eating raw clams in what is basically a basement in a train station in the middle of Manhattan should not be a great idea, but I did it all the same. I also had a salad with some scallops. My lunch mate had a turkey burger. By the time we stood up, I could tell that something was not sitting just right. I can't put my finger on it, but the food just did not taste great. I thought the service was very attentive although at one point when I asked my server to let the person shucking the clams decide what kind I should have that day as they often know what is freshest, best etc, she basically said that he does not know anything and that he shucks what she tells him. The fact that the guy did not seem to speak English did not sit well with me as her comment felt a bit racist. I have no doubt he knew A LOT about those clams . Anyway, its better than eating the fast food that is down there and I would go back to have a drink at the long bar when you come in, but maybe not sit down for a full meal again .

Net/net: this place is a terrific value on top of outstanding food, servedup by genuinely nice people. Another review called out this place as racist because ""it crossed their mind that a waitress mistake was to benefit anglo's"". Give me a break. Capitan is a wonderful community where everyone is welcome. The owners/staff deserve better. Every local restaurant is packed with clients of every ethnicity. We don't know the owners, we just enjoy/support this and all Capitan restaurants working hard to make a living for their families. But, the racist comment by some knucklehead shouldn't be allowed to stand unanswered. Makes you wonder who the racist is in this case. I guess they don't dine out enough to know how to call the Mgr to their table to discuss an issue  get it quietly resolved Interestingly, Oso Grill management could have responded to that unfair, bogus review/comment  but they are too nice.

I have faced subtle discrimination in many countries but never overt and institutionalized racism as I have at Fernandos Beach Bar.A few weeks I ago I called ahead to ask if the bar was open. When I spoke in Sinahalese, the manager told me that I could only come if I am with a guest but not of the hotel simply a white person. Shocked and in disbelief I nevertheless visited the place with a friend and I have the manager on camera saying that locals are not allowed at the beach bar. Locals instead are required to use a separate bar at the back. I was told that I would only be allowed at the beach bar if a foreigner accompanies me. I repeatedly asked him to clarify this point and he insisted that this is the policy of the management. Please, I ask you to avoid this place on principle. We simply should not support such overt institutionalized discrimination. The shocking thing was that it wasnt my first time there.

I tried to explain to him, that I was there for a gathering upstairs and would buy a drink right after putting my things down. But he continued yelling at me and ushering me out.

It also happened that I did not have cash on me and the guy at the entrance asked me to go inside, pay the entrance fees and bring back the credit card ticket to him..

The receptionist said ""YOU have a reservation with US"". When I insisted that I did and that my date was parking the car, they said the couldn't understand my last name and that maybe I didn't have a reservation. I spelled out a 3 letter last name and they still gave me looks and doubted me. I finally pointed it out on their screen. My date and I were the only 2 people of color in the whole restaurant. The British server who was otherwise humorous and friendly with the table next to us was very short and rude to us, even when I tried to make some conversation with him. On top of what felt like some racist resistance toward my date and myself, the service was extremely poor and totally unacceptable.There was significant delay between our fish to meat and the server came and apologized and poured extra wine into our glasses. My date said he did not want any more wine and he poured it into his glass anyway which was incredibly insulting. They had a fixed multicourse menu and our server brought out one course twice, took it back and completely forgot another course. After bring served dessert, we reminded them about our missing course and he rolled his eyes and questioned us about the missing course as if we were lying. Finally they realized something was wrong and changed our server. The 2nd serve questioned us again and said HE did bring us that course. I told him he has never even been to our table. He then realized that he confused us with someone else and gave us our squab course AFTER dessert. He did apologize and owned their mistake. However, after we paid the full amount which was close to 600, they ""cancelled"" our reservation on OpenTabel so that we can't review their terrible service on OT. In sum: 1 They didn't bring the right courses 2 they missed a course 3 they tried to accuse us of lying about the missing course 4 they retroactively deleted our reservation on OT to avoid a negative review and yet our charges still remain. If they want to retroactively cancel our reservation so we can't leave a review on OpenTabel, they should also not charge us. It is evident that Ambience has fraudulent intentions, racist tendencies and terrible service and their business should be reported to the BBB. We have contacted OT to help resolve this unethical issue as well."

While we entered the guard  fellow Indian who was a Malayali tells us not to use the cafe as a passage. It is because the cafe is linked to other shop which further leads to an exit to another street. With due respect considering he was an elderly man we obliged and we're strolling in the cafe. Infact I told my husband that let's eat something in this cafe like tea, cakes etc. As it is a Jewish place and might have something different to offer. Hence we entered inside and we're seeing stuff around. We also saw many foreigners at that place who were not given any instructions at the gate by the same guard, however we didn't react to it. We just stopped at the clothes counter to take a look and the same guard again came and told my husband not to use it as a passage. He specifically pointed out at us. There were many people all foreigners to be precise around us who were either eating or strolling it in the cafe but he made it a point and only told us. My husband and I were very upset and we told the workers there that this is purely racist and he being an Indian himself cannot be doing this. Kerala is apparently God's own country but it was quite disheartening and upsetting to come across such behaviour.I urge people of the cafe to please expel the guard who has absolutely no sense of talking to people or instructing them. He is purely racist and a rude individual. I wish I could give a negative rating, however TripAdvisor doesn't allow it. My mother in law got scared and asked us not to argue which is what many of us tend to do. We made it a point to tell all the workers about it and hope they understood. But the guard towards the end yelled back at us. In a country like India which is multilingual and respects all kind of communities, welcomes outsiders  this kind of racist behaviour should not have any place. Also you wouldn't want to visit a place which takes pride in the superiority of white skin and intends to make you feel like an alien in your country."

Of course that this establishment should not tolerate hawkers offering goods to their clients if they don't want to, but in sending them away, they should show respect for their basic human dignity. The language the young waiter used was so rude, aggressive and racist! Even the waiter himself acknowledged to the old man that he was racist! It was a heartbreaking scene. I am ashamed not to have intervened. No one from the people sitting at the terrace bothered to say anything! I was with my baby and my mother who didn't feel well from the heat and at that moment I estimated that it was better to stay away from the argument.

A few moments later, a different, much older and, unhealthier gentleman wearing thick yet trendy glasses arrived. He told us we were not welcome and that he would not serve us... The original bartender looked at us, then him, then us... all with a confused look on his face. We were sober, well dressed, and polite. There was zero reason to not be served. In fact 2 of the guys said that was the first time they had been refused service. It was very strange, as we are literally professional athletes and are always greated with open arms. In fact that is the reason I am writing this review, because we never do, and did not identify ourselves. The only conclusion we could come up with was either the guy was a racist as 2 of the 15 guys are brown. Or he hated the Trunmp talk coming from our bench.

We are very humble people and when we politely said thank you anyway after asking if they had an item on the menu, she still managed to whinge out loudly to her co workers and tried to humiliate us. Absolutely disgusting and immature of her considering we were nothing but patient and polite with her to begin with. Not sure if she was having a bad day or not but she really didnt need to take it out on 2 innocent people just wanting to eat some seafood.

There are some aspects that need improvement but it is a very enjoyable experience overall. We used the large beds on both occasions in the VIP area and the ambience is superb. The swimming pool is an oasis in the hot sunshine. It can only be used by those in the VIP area. Any others trying to use it are swiftly invited to move. The ambience is very similar to the clubs in St Tropez and very relaxing. My girlfriend is mixed race and we encountered no racism at all despite the earlier review. Having said that she is extremely beautiful being an international model. Food was excellent as was the wine list. Service on the second day was attentive. There were some downsides. First, there was no music either live or piped. On the second day we went, there was some music but it derived from the radio. Other beach clubs on the Nice beach had DJs or live music which sounded funky and appropriate for a club. The lavatories are less than clean. They are very poor and grubby. They need immediate attention. We joked about catching herpes but there was a grain of truth in our banter. We used the four poster bed but there was no veil on the top of the bed so sunshine streamed in. The club utilised a single parasol but it was insufficient to cover the size of the bed. A simple veil that can be moved would cost cents and I fail to understand that the veil is missing. The service was variable. We have used the Radisson Beach several times which is excellent but the service at Cocoon was not good especially on Day One. Bearing in mind we had paid a premium to use the VIP section, many times we had to find the beach boy to serve us. He was a bit grumpy and not amenable to serving us in spite of the large tip we gave him. The food was good although the menu was not very comprehensive. Overall we really enjoyed our days at Cocoon Beach but it needs to iron out its short comings,"

A big argument followed asking the reason for her rage and the irrational answer was to tell us to leave and then screaming beyond unacceptable insults related to origin arguments with swearings.

However, the service is awful and it cannot be excused because they offer occasional good music. Last night we went there for a concert, which was really good. We were six people on the table, and they got the check mixed up which, in retrospect, was predictable. I wished we had paid separately for every drink we had upfront, but we had not, and they ended up charging us for three extra beers. When we checked about five times among each other, we told the waitress she might have made a mistake, yet she never even considered that there could be a small possibility that the addition could be wrong. She ended up letting her supervisor know, who was even more impossible. The supervisor, called upon to ""handle the situation"", ended up telling us right away ""I will not deal with this, just get your money together and pay"". When I tried to explain to her what could have gone wrong, for the third time, she said that she had been working in the place for ten years and there was absolutely no way that any employee could have made a mistake, and patronizingly told me that ""Probably you are not aware of it, but there is tax and gratuity included"". When I told her even when these are kept in mind there is something wrong, she told me in all of her ten years she has only seen Jews behaving this way, which was, obviously, openly racist. I must say at this point we were speaking Turkish, so she probably had no problem being completely discriminatory, since no nonTurk would be able to understand what she was saying. This is as hypocritical as it is racist.Do not go to this place, it has at least one employee that is openly antiSemitic and the whole place clearly rips people off. If you really like a band playing here, either do not drink anything or pay for all of your drinks when you buy them, do not put them in a tab.

All we were doing was just talking and hvng a laugh and we were not 18yr old or teenagers that did not know how to behave in restaurant. You can not expect large group to sit silence and eat their meal and go. I would never recommend this place to anyone as the Manager has no customer etiquette. I felt it was a racist remark. Very dissapointing evening. We as respected people paid for what we ordered and just left. We were at point of ordering more food but at remarks of Manager to us we decided to just leave. Horrible experience. Spoilt the evening for our niece whom we had the Hen night.

We were a group of 14 girls for dinner. We were not rowdy or exceptionally noisy but the manager had the cheek to tell us to keep quiet as it was disturbing the other guests. As you would expect in a group of 14 there is bound to be some level of noise. However the restaurant was quite full and there was general noise coming from all the tables. After half an hour or so the manager came back saying we are making his customers leave. That was a false accusation as no one had left on our account. We were appalled at his behaviour and the way he was speaking to us, it almost felt personal. When we said we would never come back after such treatment from him he said in exact words "" we don't need people like you here."" What's that supposed to mean!!! This is definitely a racist comment and no one should treat their customers in this manner. He was extremely rude. Even the waitresses were embarrassed with the managers behaviour and they kept apologising for his rudeness. May I also add this is not the first time we have had rude attitude from this restaurant. This will be the last time any of us will ever set foot in this place. How this person has become a manager is beyond me. I urge the owner to rethink who he is employing as he is pushing customers away and by making racist comments he could ruin the reputation of the restaurant."

A pushy person infront of the restaurant conviced us and guaranteed that if the food was not good, we don't need to pay at all. We sat upstairs and ordered a plate of meze and 2 main kebab dishes. It took a long time , meze was very basic but we did not say anything. Main course arrived . My wife's plate was wrong!!!! And replaced with a more expensive kebab!!! Since we were familiar with Turkish food ,we figured out and sent it back to be replaced . I started eating mine. I could not swallow the first bite . It was horrendous. I think it was cooked a week ago or something . I asked the waiter to come and see for himself. He suddenly became rude and aggressive . I asked for his manager and he never showed up!!!! He tried saying racial things which is so embarrassing to mention this here! We paid the total bill and left without having a bite. Very expensive . The worst restaurant experience I have ever had!

The food arrived and I found that mine is different! I told them and they had to change it because I found out!!! My husband started eating his mixed grill dish and the first bite was so horrible that he could not continue. He called the waiter and said that this food is not freshly made and it has been cooked days ago! He refused and started being rude. We asked for manager and he said Ok . He left us there for 10 minutes and brought us the bill for meze and drinks and said that manager is gone home !!! While we were leaving , we heard that he was telling the other customers that they are Irani!!!!! My husband asked them why are you telling other customers that where we are from! We are Persians and proud but we are living in UK for years. He became aggressive and said just leave!!!!! I have never seen something like this in my entire life. Horrible food.

Me and a few friends visit Dolce Vita for a birthday brunch. A great time was had by all.2. After brunch, we head to the outside area to enjoy more drinks. Upon entering the outside area, two older white gentleman see me and my friends and hastily move to another area by the hotel rooftop pool.3. Shortly after moving to another area, the two gentleman summon the manager of Dolce Vita and then engage in a heated discussion whilst pointing at me directly throughout.4. After concluding the discussion with the two older white gentleman, the manager and another member of staff come over to me and inform me that me and my friends will no longer be served drinks. Also, once we finished he drinks we currently had, we had to leave the premises immediately.5. I ask point blank if the reason we are being asked to leave is because the two older white gentleman have an issue with me The manager and his colleague smirk and shrug their shoulders. I ask more pointedly ""are you asking me to leave these premises because I am black"" Again, both colleagues smirk and then repeat their request to leave the premises.After this exchange I left the premises if only to ensure that I myself did not escalate the situation by reacting angrily in any way.So to all my fellow travellers, restaurant enthusiasts or anyone simply looking for a nice restaurant or hotel to visit:1. If you are black like myself, DO NOT visit this restaurant! It has already been made clear to me that anyone who shares the same skin tone as myself will not be welcome.2. If you are a person who believes in equality and the fair treatment of all fellow human beings, DO NOT visit this restaurant! Unfortunately, this establishment does not believe in the same value.3. If you are looking for a hotel to stay at whilst in Singapore, DO NOT stay at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore. I have relayed this feedback directly to the management at both Dolce Vita and the Mandarin Oriental Singapore.Singapore is a wonderful place to live and my experience at Dolce Vita is not typical of my daily experience in this wonderful city. I really do not like having to write a review such as this. But the only way to change the attitudes of racist and ignorant people is to call out their behaviour at the outset.I hope nobody goes through the same kind of experience I have gone through. To ensure this does not happen, stay away from Dolce Vita and the Mandarin Oriental."

After going to a concert in Granada, a group of eight friends and I decided to get a bite to eat on Pedro Antonio. The majority in our party decided to try Frankfurts Bocanegra. After ordering drinks, we sat at one of the outside tables in front of the restaurant and looked at the menu. Nothing on the menu seemed appealing to me as I didnt feel like eating meat. While the rest of our group ordered sausages and sandwiches, I walked across the street and got a very good falafel. Upon returning to Frankfurts Bocanegra to rejoin our group in the outdoor terrace, the owner, who apparently saw me cross the street for a falafel, approached our table and started ranting that I had supported terrorism by buying Arabic food. When I and others in our group responded that we didnt agree with his perspective, the owner became very aggressive and started yelling at us, using highly inappropriate racist and islamophobic language that cannot be included in a Tripadvisor comment. Ironically, the owner stated that we should be supporting Spanish food. This confrontation went on for about 10 minutes before the owner left, literally screaming at us. After finishing the meal, two members of our party entered to pay. Just to be sure, one of the members of our group asked a waiter who the man was that had approached our table. The waiter confirmed that he was the owner of Frankfurts Bocanegra.Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment."

I have ordered online with other restaurants and it seem like it is a problem so I would rather call and be on hold. Dining there was pretty good. I've been to both China Towns in LA and San Francisco and I feel that this restaurant is just as good. Its better to go on a crowded night as the dim sum is always fresh and the carts are plentiful.

Mind you, this isn't our first time at Papsito's. I've been here numerous times for dinner, and a Saturday night for hookah. There were two other Spanish girls behind us, they said ""what did he say"", I responded ""he said a minimum of a hour wait."" We moved to the side, so we wouldn't hold up any lines or anything. They then, went to the bouncer, and he let them in. HAAAAAAAAAAAA! What happened to that one hour wait!! Was it because of our skin color, because we are NOT super FAIR SKIN!! What an insult! I will never come back here and give them my hardearned money. I could of easily went up to the bouncer, cursed him out, curse their establishment, however, even if he did let us in at that point, I wouldn't even spend my money! This place is only good for hookah , that's about it, there aren't a lot of spots uptown that offer hookah. RACIST DOMINICANS I TELL YA! SAVE YOUR MONEY!"

Left disappointed and fuming. RACIST OWNER,"My family and I were travelling together and one family member was craving pho so we found this place with great reviews on Google. We were a table of 6. When we got there, they sat us down and they seemed polite but I left fuming and disappointed. We order a lot of food  quite a few dishes and a bottle of wine and a few beers. We got our apps quickly and we wanted another bottle of hot sauce so we took it from the table beside us. The owner freaked out and said, ""No. Its for this table."" So we asked the owner for another bottle of hot sauce since we were a table of 6 and we like our hot sauce. He said, ""No, you already have one."" We answer, ""Can we have another one for the table""  It's hot sauce. It's a restaurant. This SHOULD BE NO BIG DEAL. He gave us a dirty look. Thankfully, the server problem solved and brought us small plates to pour the hot sauce and leave it at the other end of the table. This definitely left a bad taste in our mouth.The rest of the food took forever to come out  almost one hour AND they forgot a dish that we had ordered. The food was meh. Pho was not good and the other dishes were salty.But the worst was yet to come. We noticed that all the new tables were receiving complimentary drinks and we had not. So i asked the owner, ""What are they drinking"" He said, ""I'm giving our complimentary local wine/champagne."" I mentioned that we had not received any and his exact words I still remember were, ""Asians don't like this drink."" I was kind of left speechless and all I said was, ""You don't know if we would like it or not and it would be nice to ask."" We are actually from Canada so maybe our taste buds are different. Anyways, the food is meh. The area is dark and dingy. The service is not bad there were a couple servers who were actually so kind and apologized for the owner's behaviours. But the owner is a cheap RACIST jerk. My whole family left the restaurant with a bitter taste in our mouths."

I had the worst experience I have encountered at this establishment down to the rude, aggressive and even abusive behavior of multiple members of staff. I was physically assaulted by a bouncer for no plausible reason and was denied any explanation from the management team or any other member of staff. This violent behavior along with racist attitudes towards tourists seems to be a trend at the club from looking at previous reviews. It is an unsafe environment and an establishment that takes advantage of its customers in more ways than one. Shari Vari should be ashamed of themselves for the way they treat their customers  it is unacceptable and disgusting."

I highly recommend the place HR to explain this to your guards. The comment was racist and offensive. Shame on you."

The location is small but very cozy  the staff was super friendly and helpful and we are so glad we skipped dessert at the restaurant because these martinis were the best kind! Since we were celebrating my birthday, I got the birthday cake martini and my husband got the nutella with coconut! Yum, yum, yum! The presentation was perfect and the flavors were spot on! SO glad we checked it out, will be back! By the way  one of the reviews below said the establishment is racist. Um. No. My husband and I are both originally from Puerto Rico and were speaking Spanish to each other most of the time we were there and were not made at all to feel unwelcome or that it was anything out of the ordinary. Savannah has some pretty strict laws on underage drinking and serving minors. My husband and I 40 and 35, respectively were asked for ID at most places we went  in order to comply with the law  not to profile. Its unfortunate that their international ID's weren't accepted but I highly doubt it was due to racism."

She spoke down to them and made them feel ashamed for asking for water and for an update on the progress of very slow food service. At the counter my wife paid her cash and the host utterly ignored her, instead trying to be charming to me, then she then handed me the change. This kind of racism is utterly unacceptable and I was very disheartend indeed to experience it in Australia. On top of this, the food was expensive, slow service and small portions."

However I was massively disappointed in finding overcharged prices, for mediocre low value food and tescovalue brand hot drinks such as coffee that aren't even made fresh to order made day prior and left overnight. The food itself is very poor despite being basic cafe meals, the staff quite rude, inexperienced and confronting in my short experience and was also disgraced to see that foreigners/tourists are actually charged more! This is why customers do not received proper receipts, the price is essentially made up by the female running the cafe depending on whether she suspects she can get away with overcharging. Upon confronting the overcharge you will receive some made up excuse. I've noticed other reviews here wondering why things were so expensive and this is likely why. Avoid at all costs."

This was pointed out to us as a ""government policy"". Although, mentioning the allowance of crossing the border and entering the UK with this form of identity, they insisted we had to leave the location immediately. This is not only a form of not being well informed about rules and regulations in your own country, but also a form of racism, as we were told that our ID's ""are not English"" which prevented us from being allowed a drink. Hence, the rude and inappropriate manner of having international guests does not even deserve the star that we had to give."

Potentially racist.,"Me and my other half visited this 'restaurant' last week. It was an absolute disgrace. We walked in and they baisically gestured without acknowledging us and grunting to pick a table but we saw the staff seat spanish people but not us. We immediately felt like we were so unwelcome. Then we sat down and when we couldnt speak much spanish they seemed very annoyed and still grunting angrily they said abruptly french German English We said we spoke english as we are from scotland. The man then returned with an english menu and slapped it down infornt of us without care. We ordered the seafood platter to begin and paella for mains  this would cost us 52 euro. We wanted to celebrate our trip and one year together and wanted it to be special. The waitress came back with a 'seafood platter'. The seafood platter was NOT fresh. It was rubbery, smelt disgusting and everything was deep fried within an inch of its life. Made me feel sick so i left it. We put our cutlery on our plates awaiting the next course. The extremely rude waitress came over picked up our plates and from a standing height THREW the cutelry down on the table for each of us with an almighty crash. The other spanish folk in the restaurant did not even blink leading us to believe this was a common occurence. We felt even more unwelcome and could not believe that this was happening. We had been nothing but polite DESPITE their grotesque food and behaviour so far. The next course arrived and thoughts of gordon ramsay in his kitchen nightmares came to mind when they find old rotten food out of the back...The 'authentic' paella was like vomit, though vomit would have been nicer. It was soggy like it had been made a long time ago. I make better stuff myself! That actually is fresh and tasty. It stank, the seafood was questionable. It wasnt warm and had zero flavour. Gross. I couldnt eat it for gagging and my other half couldn't eat it all either. They came back to get the plates  no eye contact no speach  the worst service in the world. We wished we had just made food at our camper because we make better food in there by miles.We rejected the dessert option, payed the 52 euros PURELY because we felt so out of our comfort zone and worried about them being more nasty. Baisically if you know anything about food at all, if you want a nice atmosphere, if you want nice food then DO NOT GO HERE. If they are reading this then  shame on you and thanks for nothing."

Terrible attitude!!,"Went there on Tuesday late afternoon near closing time. There were no other customers on the premises. We sat in the more outdoor side on a large 2m x 2m wooden plank table as the main cafe area was closed. We were a party of 12 of Asian appearance except for my dad who is English. Our party of 12 comprised of 6 seniors over 70 years of age, 3 adults, a 5 year old, a 1 year old autistic toddler and an infant asleep in a pram. My husband in his 30s arrived in the cafe first and proceeded to fetch some table water from the fridge to settle the main party as everyone were either really old or really young and 2 nursing mothers. The lady with maroon/red hair at the main shop was already irritated and stopped my husband from what he was doing. He explained that he was just getting some water first with full intent of purchasing from the cafe 7 ice creams and 2 energy drinks. As we were finishing our ice creams. My cousins autistic 1 year old toddler climbed onto a huge wooden plank table near us and his mother took some photos of him. At this time the lady from the main cafe bursted down the aisle and shouted at toddler Get off the table, people eat on that you know! This is Australia. You dont do that here. You can go do that in China!, and hurried to leave the scene. I was browsing my phone when I heard this and called her out on it. I said Hey. That was inappropriate. There is no need to be a racist and drag county into this. She claimed that she isnt a racist. And I said why not say Korea or Japan. To which she replied they dont do that. Only people from China behave like this and then called me a racist for calling her out. I dont disagree that climbing on top of a table is bad manners but she could have just stopped at that. There is no need to take the matter to a country level. Separately, I will be reporting the incident to the Australian Human Rights Commission. This IS Australia. We are a multicultural society that pride ourselves on inclusion for all ethnicity as well as those with disabilities. This is just not on!!!"

We booked on line in the afternoon for the same night, a Saturday. I was surprised to see tables available at every time throughout the night, we booked for 9.30. On arrival we were told the table will be ready shortly as the previous guests were about to leave. We waited in the street and after 10 minutes they bought us a glass of prosecco each, we waited in total 30 minutes before we were taken to the table. When we sat down they refilled the glasses with a little more prosecco and then nothing. After another 30 minutes and having watched every table after us get a basket of bread I complained to the matre d, he didn't apologise but just sneered and set he would sort us out plenty of bread. A big basket arrived, followed by a waiter with another who was also sneering. We said we were OK with the one basket and to take it away. The wine and the starters arrived, now nearly 11pm, we had marinated fish and beef carpaccio, both were tasteless and not by any means exceptional, the wine was OK but at least 30 more than other places. We watched a group of waiters laughing and passing the breadbasket to one of their number who then brought it to our table, we told them to take it away and stop being so rude. A couple of minutes later we watched the same thing happen again and for the fourth time the basket was brought back by a sneering waiter. We then saw the matre d at the next table talking to the guests, pointing to us and laughing, I then told him what I thought and that an appropriate review would follow, he told us that a bad review would not affect his business as the place was always full. Trouble is he is probably right. At this point we walked out, the treatment the other guests received all Italian, was a far cry from what we got. The matre d and his staff are a disgrace to Sicily as are all racists."

Of course it wasnt a pleasant experience, but it wasnt a big deal. But after the seller left the waiter started saying loudly racist comments such as niggr and monkey several times in Spanish. Well, I speak Spanish so I had the bad luck to hear everything he said. And when I confronted him he responden so what should I call him, and he repeatedly argued that he had right. Then another waiter came and tried to explain that the African sellers usually bothers the guests, and that the sellers should be thankful because they get food and shelter in Spain. I find this experience tremendously racist and was considering going to the police, but due to lack of time I didnt go. And about the food; I ordered a hamburger and a entrecte. The hamburger bread was completely wet and the entrecte was impossible to chew. The hamburger wasnt tasty whatsoever and it seemed cheap and fast made. The entrecte was tasty, but like I said; impossible to chew.Dr. Rengifo"

No positive reply from the Staff to my review will make me go back. In Vail, there are better places to go, trust me.

But that doesnt change the terrible staff attitude, I also experienced!"

I am one not to write reviews, but after being in the receiving end of racism in 2019 I feel obligated to write one. So heres what happened...today I visited Fall Line at Vail Village with my wife and 2 other couples family and friends. When we ordered drinks my wife didnt have her ID since we were coming back from skiing and was not allowed to order. Even when we I have a scanned copy of her license. By the way shes 29 and clearly doesnt look under age. Either way, the waiter explained the policy and while we werent happy we understood that it was Colorado law. Thus, the rest of us ordered drinks and she just had water for the duration of our meal. Up until this point everything was fine. We ordered drinks and food. While we waited for our food we discussed amongst us in our native language SPANISH how things differ in regards to the policy and not accepting the scanned copy. Even a couple that didnt speak spanish sitting next to us jumped into the conversation expressing they didnt agree either with the fact they didnt serve drinks to my wife.This is where everything took an 180 degree turn for the worst...First, a staff member approached the couple next to us and told them a comment in the neighborhood of enjoy the show. The couple couldnt believe the comment and the level of racism towards us and left the restaurant. Then, while one of the couples in our group was still eating the same staff member came over to table and placed the check in front of me. To this I turned around and gave it back to her letting her know that it we were still eating and we hadnt requested the check. At that point we werent sure if was a confusion or something else. A few minutes later I left the table to the restroom and when I came back the group gave me the unpleasant news the staff once again had brought without us requesting it. We kept our composure and ordered coffee. By the way, we were NEVER offered to ordered coffee or desserts. Clearly at this point they wanted to get rid of us. I was pretty disappointed with the treatment and when we did asked for the check I asked our waiter if there was a reason why another staff had brought the check over twice without being requested. First he answer that it was probably a mistake, but when I asked again but why twice. He rudely responded that we were mocking at their policy towards ID. Yes, while we were displeased we never mocked at it as I described above. It was then that for the first time in my 33 year old life I felt what it was to be subject of RACISM because I am HISPANIC and choose to speak in my native language. Ive never in my life been so offended. To all of this they also included an automatic 20 gratuity not deserved which its not disclaimed anywhere in the place/menu. We decided to pay the bill with the unearned gratuity and just leave the place because there was no use in getting into a discussion with ignorant and racist people. It is unbelievable and sad that they treat patrons this way just because they couldnt understand a different language other than English. I truly hope ownership takes action on this matter given Vail gets quite a diverse amount of visitors from all over the world every year. I never intend to visit this restaurant again, and hope anyone reading this review hispanic or not thinks twice if they truly want to patronize a place in which racism still exist in 2019."

And I'm so pleased we did! The restaurant was a bit quiet when we arrived, which initially felt a bit awkward, but we got over that pretty quickly once we sat down at our table. Our waitress was absolutely lovely and we didn't have to wait for very long for our first course to arrive. I ordered some soup, and the waitress was more than happy to teach me how to drink it properly from the little pot and cup. Thank you for that!Both my boyfriend and I ordered the chef's selection of sushi, which came with ten large pieces of nigiri and six pieces of cucumber maki and was freshly made right in front of us. I definitely recommend ordering this if you're dining with someone else, because it was really fun going through our identical platters and trying everything at the same time! Who knew raw squid and octopus could be so deliciousThe only downside was the rather unimpressive dessert menu, which featured little more than ice cream. Some Japanese desserts would have been a lovely way to end the meal, but other than that, I had a fantastic experience at Momo! If I ever visit this area again, I definitely know where I'll be having my supper. It's such a shame this little gem of a restaurant is tucked away in such an obscure area of London!Also: I'd disregard the rather rude review on this page stating that the manager is racist. I completely disagree  the staff was nothing but lovely to us!"

We have been here three times hoping it would be different but it is the same each time. To start, there's a specials menu that is only written in Japanese and she refuses to translate. We once managed to persuade one of the junior staff to translate some of it for us.The food from the specials menu was better than that on the main menu and cheaper too! This member of staff was promptly told off by the nasty woman in charge. NonJapanese are given worse seats even when we book, their food is kept on the side longer to make it colder, and generally no smiles are given. The old woman running the show is also rude to her own staff such that there is high staff turnover and a resentment is palpable. The chairs are uncomfortable and the tables are cheap quality, giving a diner kind of feel.All of this is a huge shame because the food is excellent quality and that's why we came back a couple of times. However, portion sizes are small and two people can't really eat for under 100 without alcohol which is expensive in this part of London.Go if you're Japanese, or if you are brave  also demand the specials menu. We won't go back."

I thought it was a normal casual dining place, boy I was wrong. The waiters/waitress are rude but I get they have act like dcks to the customers. Some people find this enjoyable, I don't get the appeal. One of the jokes went way too far with one of the staff. He made a racist joke about my sister's eyes being slanted because she's Asian. We had a talk with the manager about the problem. A practical joke is funny but if it's sexist or racist, then that crosses the line. I understand completely how the restaurant operates now but I don't recommend anyone like me who has sensitivity issues to come here. Little children shouldn't come here either because of the offensive humor. The place had bugs and litter everywhere. It felt like I was in a dumpster. I don't think this place should keep going on because it's not necessary to be mean to others, even if it's your job. It's just not necessary or ethical.

It is not right to say that, it is horrible to treat someone who is still learning English like that. I believe that he has family members that are living in his country that doesn't even know how to speak English, so I don't know why he's judging me for my English. When my boyfriend, who is Caucasian, and I left, one of the waiter was trying to high five him, but we were mad of the previous incident, so he did not high five back. The waiter was also Hispanic, and he told my boyfriend ""in this country, if people high five you, you have high five back."" I can not believe that a Hispanic waiter commenting on a Caucasian man about his own country. At least go over their service first before talking badly about other people. All of the staff were being very offensive, which hurts my feelings.

When we asked if we could sit at one of the tables on the edge for a more picturesque view, they got really agitated, PUSHED me so hard that I bumped into my girlfriend. Anyway, the request was denied and they gestured for us to still sit at this table in the middle. They were so aggressive that they pushed the middle table and the glasses fell. We immediately decided this was not a welcoming or safe environment, said thank you and left. On our way out, myself and one of the other ladies in our party heard one of these men utter a racial slur!

It's weird they would not even look us in the eye, we were completely ignored like we didn't existed. I have never been treated like that at a restaurant. We waited at the tables that did not have a ""reserved"" sign and then eventually were told we need to move. No explanations were given why we needed to move, they basically came and shoved us off while we watched other ""white"" customers being seated and attended to. There was another Indian couple who received the same treatment. We were outraged and left, gladly at our next restaurant we were treated with a smile and courtesy.

The restaurant was mostly empty and we were the only people of color there. Right from the start, we noticed that the server was not as warm with us as he was with other tables around us. It was not that we did not speak Italian because no guest at the restaurant spoke Italian. However, the server was significantly more welcoming with other groups  sitting down and having long conversations with them, making jokes and talking about places to visit. All we got was patronizing treatment and some condescending lessons on the Italian language. Ultimately, at the end of the meal, it was customary for the server to offer every table some Limoncello. But there was no mention of that with us and we were promptly handed the check. In the end, we spent over a hundred euros for dinner and tip  because we did not want the server to also think that people of color don't tip well apart from any other preconceived notions he had that made him give this differential treatment. The sad part is that we actually liked the food but all we will remember from our experience is the feeling of being discriminated against."

Average dining experience. That is of course if you are allowed admittance. I have returned on another occasion for my boyfriends birthday and the bouncers didn't allow me in with a drivers licence. I was clearily told that if I return with a passport I would be allowed in, except when I returned I was refused entry yet again without any explanations: I was definitely not drunk and I have seen the bouncers letting people in with their credit card.. I personally think this is related to the fact that I was not English. This whole experience ruined not only my night but my boyfriends bday as well..I would definitely wouldn't come back to a place where not only is the food not up to scratch but the employees make you feel horrible before setting foot in the restaurant!"

The owner rushed out of the restaurant asking my husband to move the car from ""his spot""...which by the way is not his marked spot, it is common shared by other restaurant and businesses in the plaza. The owner became very aggressive when I refused to move the car as I had my baby with me, and at worst started flinging his hands at me and verbally abusive. Shortly after my parents arrived and my dad rushed out of his car to help me and this guy continues to tell us to go where we came from...truly racist comment! The other restaurant we were going to go to mentioned that he has been treating other ""brown"" customers like this and they are filing an official complaint against his. I called 911 but since we were there for family time, my hubby choose to cancel the complaint."

Go here if you enjoy having a finger pointed at you  be talked about for not knowing Mandarin,"The waiter was racist, sexist, and made many unnecessary remarks. I went to try this restaurant with my Mandarinspeaking friends after finishing class. The waiter was chatting with them when I came back from the washroom which was disgusting. They were speaking in Mandarin, which I do not understand. After the waiter knew that I did not understand Mandarin, he pointed a finger at me as he told my friends how important it is to know Mandarin, and how I should get a Mandarinspeaking boyfriend. He said more things as his finger was pointed at me, but my friends told me it was better that I didn't understand what he said, and did not translate the rest.The food came, and they were not that great. For the amount I was paying, I could get much larger portions and better food somewhere else.Later on in the meal, the waiter came back to chat more in Mandarin, of course, completely ignoring my presence. This time, he made many racist and unnecessary remarks about black people. My friends described those comments as very cringing and uncomfortable.So, this is my first impression of Sichuan food. Will not return, and will not recommend; unless if you enjoy having a finger pointed at you while you are being talked about like a worthless object for not speaking Mandarin. I have never had such a disappointing experience at a restaurant before."

Worst.,"Fantastic place to go if you enjoy rude, insulting and flat out racist behaviour. The food must be UNBELIEVABLE for them to get away with treating their customers the way they do. Shame we never got to try it as we were kicked out for asking whether there were any glutenfree options. We were then told to ""go get your gluten from Porky's"" and were literally chased away from the pavement outside because we were supposedly not allowed to stand there. I won't even get into the racist tirade they launched into, though they did tell us to ""go back home to Spain"" which, in their defense, was pretty funny because neither of us are from anywhere close to there. Good luck running a restaurant in the heart of Camden without accepting foreigners.Needless to say, we were absolutely baffled at the situation but it did result in us finding VietAnh on Parkway, which was fantastic. By that stage though, the chef could have spat in our food and faces, and it would still have been a massive step up from how we were treated at Thanh Binh."

I am still upset about the experience. To begin, the server was clearly racist, as we were treated completely different than the group of Hispanics that was seated next to us. We had to repeatedly ask him for refills on drinks and our food took over 45 minutes to come out. When our order arrived, one of the meals was incorrect. The waiter rudely snatched the dinner off of the table, said something under his breath and went into the kitchen. At this point, my friend was scared to even eat the next plate that came out 15 minutes later. We continued on with our dinner, having to ask for napkins, more drinks, salsas ect...ect.... Horrible service. We split our bill into 2 separate checks, thinking our friend that received the wrong dinner then had to wait an additional 15 minutes for her correct order would not be charged for her dinner. WRONG!!! When I asked for a manager, the waiter was extremely rude stating "" Oh my God, you people always have something to complain about"". EXCUSE ME You people Now I'm livid. The joke of a manager comes to our table and we explained to him that the dinner we ordered was wrong, we had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the correct food to come out and we were already done eating by the time our friends food came. His response was ""I have no way to prove you had to wait 15 minutes for your food"". Again, EXCUSE ME The first order was wrong, he should have taken the dinner off of the bill. Our bill was well over 150.00! I explained to him that the server also made a very unprofessional, racist remark when we asked to speak to a manager. The manager told me again that this is not something that I could prove. WHAT A JOKE!!! I literally thought we were being punked. I encourage everyone to go to the Lalos on Harlem instead of this joke of a restaurant. They are RACIST, unprofessional, extremely rude/slow service and the manager must have received his customer service training off of the side of a cereal box. The funny part is, my boss sent me here to see if this is where he should host our yearly vendor dinner. NO WAY!!! Absolutely NOT! This restaurant should be closed. I asked the manager for the corporate phone number, which he refused to give me. He then acted like he didn't understand English after I said that I would be contacting the owner of the restaurant to tell him about our experience that night. He told me to do whatever I wanted. I will never go here again. I would never refer anyone to this place. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE...especially if you are not Hispanic. They don't like the rest of us there."

I speak fluent Italian and I understand the Italian culture thoroughly. My friend and her uncle were visiting Rome for a week and it was their first time out of the country. For their last evening in Italy they wanted to eat at a restaurant that offered authentic Roman pasta dishes. They saw reviews for this restaurant and decided to celebrate their last evening there. What a mistake! We walked in and no one even greeted us, one of the men at the front just told us to go sit down. We found a table and had to wait at least 15 minutes until someone came over and decided to take our order.Our waitress was extremely unfriendly and had a terrible attitude. She was not willing to answer our questions and gave brief, unhelpful responses. My friend and her uncle do not speak Italian so I had to translate for them. My friend's uncle asked some details about the steak, how it was cooked, how big it was and generally if it was recommended. When I asked her about it she responded, ""It's a steak,"" and turned away to help the table next to us. We ended up ordering 3 pasta dishes, and asked for bread to be brought to the table. When the bread was brought out about ten minutes later, my friend's uncle asked if it was possible to have some butter or oil to go along with the bread. The waitress got offended and said ""We don't have butter and oil is only brought out for those who order salad"". Now I understand that bread and butter is not an Italian custom, but we are paying customers and deserve to be treated with respect. I look at the table next to us Italians and they have a bottle of oil with NO SALAD.The next part of this nightmare was when the pasta was finally brought out and my friend's uncle asks for salt and pepper. The waitress responds, ""I don't understand why he wants salt and pepper. It doesn't make sense."" I tell her, ""He wants salt and pepper, why can't he have it"" She gets angry and walks away.At this point the table next to us are giving us dirty looks and acting like they are much superior, which was really awful.Once we finished our meal, the waitress came back over to take our plates. As I was asking my friend and her uncle if they wanted coffee or amaro, the table next to us started making snarly comments about us which made the waitress laugh in our faces. She then asks impatiently, ""Well do you want coffee or what 1, 2, 3 coffees I need to know."" To which I reply, ""We are deciding! And we've decided we just want the check to get out of here!"" It then takes her about 15 minutes to bring us the check.The waitress did not once smile at us throughout our meal, or show any hospitality. I have never met any waitress as rude as her. I will NEVER step foot in this restaurant again. I am disgusted at the way we were treated. This waitress and the guests next to us were very racist and treated us like we were the scum of the earth. But why Because my friend asked for butter Because he wanted saltI have never been so angry with humanity before. This place is a disgrace. Avoid it."

My friends were little ahead of me as I was fininshing my phone call. They walked in and two hostesses ignored them completely and were busy talking to each other. When one of my friend asked for a table they looked at her and went back to talking to each other without answering her. They finally told them it would be a wait for a table. My friends waited by the counter without anyone bothering to see if they needed anything. I decided to watch from outside while I finished my phone call. When I walked in few minutes later both girls jumped up and were all over me wanted to help. I asked for a table of 5 and was shown to a table immediately without a wait. My friends joined me with I told you you so grin on their face. When our meal was done they gave me the bill. I guess because I am a Mzungu they expect me to pay for my poor Kenyan friends who happens to be much better off then myself. I am totally embarrased that there's still place like this that treat locals poorly and treat white/Asian face better because of the color of the skin. Management  owners better get a grip on this as we are only a visitor in their country.

He started with a rude welcome and continued through complaining when my wife ordered bottled water she doesn't drink alcohol as a partner to my beer...he then brought a female coworker over to the table to mock our clothes and spoke disrespectfully about my wife assuming incorrectly that she was Thai and being quite racist and our appearance we were dressed quite casually after a day cycling assuming we couldn't understand. When I interrupted and asked if he had something to say directly, he froze and scurried off to another table.We left soon after and spent the money at a few of the MANY MANY restaurants in the area that choose to appreciate the business. We had planned to spend a 34 hours sampling items and enjoying the evening...Jerky McJerkaton ruined that right quick...food wasn't terrible...but the rude treatment and racist words to my wife were NOT acceptable. She is from China and was excited to try Lebanese food for the first time."

Was quite keen to try this restaurant based on the reviews and the food looked like a unique take on German cuisine. The first time we approached we understood there was a party from 4pm from the sign so we just wanted to check if it was over it was close to 7. The service staff smoking outside just brusquely told us that there was a party, fair enough. We then asked when it would be over, at which point he rather sarcastically said ""next week"". We tried again during lunch the next day and saw one empty table near the door. Unfortunately the same person was there again and he asked brusquely again whether we had reservation. When we said no he just said they were full. Okay, the table may or may not be reserved bit this guy is just rude. He could have explained to us reservations only but nope. Also his demeanor just put us off and we did feel he was probably racist from the vibe he was giving off so if you didn't reserve he ain't obliged to act like a decent person. For context we were told by another restaurant nearby that they are full and we didn't mind it because the lady didn't seem like she was being intentionally mean."

It was totally unexpected from a restaurant that considers itself high endYesterday evening I went there with a friend for dinner. We sat outside but no one came to take our orders. After 10 minutes, we went inside to call on a waiter. We finally caught the attention of one waitress but she immediately barked at us with a very rude tone asking/demanding who let you in who allowed you to come in. Baffled we asked what she meant. She went on to say, we had told the gatemen not to allow anyone inside until the people who are already inside are all served. We were puzzled as this totally did not make sense  there was a large group inside the resultant but there were several unoccupied tables both inside and outside. I asked her to call the manager but she said he is not around. I asked for the owner or the cook and owner but was told that is not possible because she is busy. When I started my rant on how rude her treatment is and that if they are hosting a private party they should politely inform us, the manager who was according to her not there came and asked us what was wrong. When I started to explain what happened. He then asked Min felegachu new, rat felegachu new what do you want, is it dinner  this response irritated me because i it was obvious why we were there and ii min felegachu new is something you say to a stranger that has come to your house unannounced at an odd hour not to a restaurant guest during the restaurants open hour. But he asked her what is going on. The waitress then explained to him that she has been instructed not to let anyone in until the crowd inside is served. When he proposed going inside the kitchen to talk to the cook owner, the waitress immediately objected and said no way, she is going to scold us and we will get in trouble. All this conversation between the manager and the waitress was happening in front of us and we were still not seated. But the whole situation escalated when two foreigners walked in at that time. The manager politely asked them whether they have a reservation. The guests said no and manager said,  no problem, please come in. We left at that point after giving the manager and the waitress our piece of mind.I have come across service providers in the hospitality industry, like waiters, giving more attention and priority to foreign clients. In some places, the quality and swiftness of services you get actually differs deteriorates when there is a foreigner around in a different group/crowd. But I dont remember the last time I have come across such blatant, absolutely rude and borderline racist reception and handling in my own city. As we say in Amharic,  Ke fitfitu, fitu.I have decided to never dine at Mamamia and have asked my friends and colleagues not do so as well."

As we were looking at the menu outside, the waiter came to talk to us. We smiled and we said 'bon soir'. He replied bon soir in a funny way and he laughed. We didn't say anything. We went in and he put us in a small table. The place was very dark and only a couple of tables were occupied. He brought us the menu, we thanked him in french and when we started talking in our language to decide what to eat he started laughing behind us with the rest of the staff. Another waiter came to us and when I asked him to explain to me something on the menu that I didn't know he was looking at me strangely and he started making funny comments against us in french with his colleagues. Obviously, because of our nonfrench accent he thought that we couldn't understand what he was talking about. My sister asked him why he made such comments about our accent and he went silent. She told him twice that he a racist and he didn't deny it. We walked away very upset. Our night was almost ruined. Finally we had dinner at another wonderful place, very decent and much cheaper than that disgusting A la Traboule!Please avoid to go there.

Second, we ordered 2 dishes and informed that all 4 would be sharing the food; the waiter failed to inform us that he would charge separately for covers sharing food. This was subsequently reflected in the bill. When questioned, the waiter argued and was sarcastic, condescending and racist. He stated that the staff would have to wash the extra dishes, thus, the charge of Euro 2.5 each for the covers. The owner was then called who was extremely understanding and cooperative and waived the extra charge. However, the overall experience was completely ruined. Food was average. We would definitely not be visiting again!"

On the same day, we've called to confirm if booking is needed, they told us we could just walk in for drinking at the lounge. We were absolutely well dressed for such occasion. Security outside was friendly and welcoming upon arrival while inside the so called bar manager refused our entry. I watched other people walking straight in when he kept giving excuses such as we are full, you are not on the list. A middle aged french lady asked him if she could get in and he replied of course without checking the so called guest list, obviously he thought I didn't understand french. Ironically, the bar manager is an African man and we are some young Asian ladies, not quite sure what gives you the right to discriminate us but please bare in mind you work in a service industry of 21st century. Almost ruined our nigt but thanks to Paris, there are still so many nice places worth visiting. Never going back nor recommend anyone to go."

We hadn't even stepped through the door when immediately we heard loud shouts of 'konnichiwa' and 'nihao' etc. What shocked us most was that the bartender or someone working at the bar was saying such things and encouraging such behaviour. Not only so, as we quickly determined that it wasn't safe for us to enter and turned to leave, he went towards the window to continue to shout and laugh at us. I have never had such a shocking experience. No we were not drunk or rowdy, we were just looking forward to enjoying some nice tapas and no these people were not saying such things to be 'friendly'. They were clearly trying to harass and shame us. I couldn't make this up if I tried. What kind of a business is this This is a SHAMEFUL business, a business that SEVERELY lacks any sense of human decency, class, respect, etiquette and professionalism.

It was dark, smelled like urine and the floor was sticky, but we thought it didn't matter because we wanted cheap food to give us a bit of energy for our sport. I went up to the bar and instantly turned away. The explanation of why we couldn't be served was: BAR STAFF: Sorry I can't serve you.ME: Ok, whyBAR STAFF: Because of your shorts.I paused for a few seconds while I tried to understand what he meant. He then walked away and served someone else. Firstly, I fully understand the whole no sports clothes thing because it's linked to a certain type of person and if I had come into the place a few hours later maybe after 5pm or 6pm I would accept it, but this was noon time and the place was half empty. My other issue was that while me and my girlfriend were rejected service because we were dressed for the sport we were about to partake in, the group of 10, drunk, urine soaked, jean wearing old men shouting racist abuse to an foreign family outside the window, creating an intimidating environment for other customers are perfectly acceptable. I understand there are a lot of racist people in Bradford but the staff and security upstairs being so openly ignorant of this is unacceptable... in my opinion of course."

It was weird and I felt embarrassed for being accused of something we haven't done because the last time we came here we were still sober when we left. I didn't feel comfortable after hearing what he said so I asked one of the staff and they told us that a week prior to our visit there are some people, who happens to be from our country, btw i'm Asian, got so drunk and made scene. My point here, it's a shame how the host generalized people according to their nationality, sorry to say but he is being racist.

We love the crab legs and steamed shrimp and always get several helpings of both. The crab imperial is really good too. The desserts arent great but usually too full for them anyway. My biggest complaint on the last visit was the racist waiter and the reason I wont come again. He had an attitude towards us from the beginning even though we were nothing but polite. We had water with our meal and asked him for refills THREE TIMES! He never brought refills, though he continued to bring refills to all of the nonwhite patrons. The only other white couple at the table next to us also complained about him to the manager for terrible service. Im not one to play the race card but this was beyond obvious. Even tried to flag him down as he walked near us and he would purposely avoid our table to go to another. Our tip reflected his service. Its a shame because we always enjoy their food but do not want to deal with racist service. Gave it a 2 instead of 1 star review since the food was at least good though I left dehydrated."

I went there with my family including my 2 little nieces 4 and 2 years old after a long walk from champsellysees. We had no idea of the ratings however we were hungry and went there to ask for a table. No one bothered to respond to our ask and they completely ignored us while they attended other French people. We were disappointed and exhausted and had no choice but to leave! It really interests me to see how the Asians, who are actually a big source of tourism influx to these countries are not treated well!! I would never recommend this place for anyone especially people with families. Horrible experience!!!!!!!!"

I decided for Hornhuset because I've been there many times and it was a good place for a beer and a nice conservation with your friends. But the guy at the entrance yesterday was so offensive when he told us we were intoxicated and that we couldn't enter. Obviously it was not true and I had no words for my friends to justify this behavior from a city where I've been living for years. We were shocked of what happened but smart enough to understand that probably, beside not being Swedish, we did not show our money on time to be on target. I'll not come back here anymore, with none of friends and I'll tell about this story the most that I can around Stockholm. Do not plan to come here if you feel like to be like us: normal people, well dressed, with the wish to go out for a friendly beer during a reunion. And you Hornhuset, try to be more respectful and less racist next time, especially if you are still empty inside, so that maybe you'll not lose more costumers."

I showed him the details. He said tell your friend to come and pick you from downstairs.Due to the noise in the club my friend wasnt able to hear me and I sent him a message but he didnt receive the message till later due to network problems.About 20 min later my girlfriend comes down she was at the same table and she asked the security why they were not letting us in and she was actually at the same table that we said we were going to, that the security had blatantly lied before that there was no table with the name we gave!Some two white girls came, note that they did not have a table he let them in no questions asked! Didnt even ask for their ID. Whats the reasoning behind thisHe may not be so educated hence hes a security guy but I expect him not to be racist towards anybody whatsoever!In this day and age to experience such is disgusting and I have been living in the UAE for 8years now and have never experienced such disgusting behavior!Shame on that security and the establishment for allowing such to happen in this day and age!At this point we decided to leave because it was getting late and we had literally stood there over 30 min and we were getting cold!If youre black or of any other race apart from white go to this place knowing that you might be discriminated against!"

I went there with a friend and was told to wait for entry into the bar area. So it's two women. Dressed smart elegant as per the dress code. In heels. And with no clear answer from the door staff as to why we couldn't enter. During these 15 minutes we witnessed 8 people being let in. All of them had arrived after us and clearly stated to the hostess that they had no reservations. On pressing for an answer from the door staff we were told we couldn't enter because ""you just can't"". The hostess couldn't even muster up a proper response or an actual reason why we were not being allowed in. I am struggling to understand why we were asked to wait in the first place because this just added to the humiliation. The lack of a response or any clear reason is just appalling. I'm Indian and have been to several clubs in Dubai and all over the world and have heard there are places in Dubai that implement the practice of racial profiling, but have never felt discriminated against until this particular evening. I was forced to draw this conclusion in light of the clear lack of any other reason to allow us in. This place is as archaic as they come. Don't bother going if you've spent a day in the Dubai sun, because there'll be no hope of getting in!!!"

At first Tony Gomez, the owner of the restaurant made the reservation for one week earlier. Any way I warmed him via e mail, but he did not reply, then I called them and warned again over the phone. They turned an apology email, confirmed January 30, 2016 and we were welcome. During our Paris trip of last weekend we went there as booked, but there was no place inside.The waiter advised if we had not reservation we could not have the seats. I told him we did.He told ""Even 2 days ago all the seats are booked"", I said ""We did 2 weeks ago the booking"" , unfortunately their French was poor, unsufficient and disrespectful, thanks God my friends dont know French otherwise they could be deeply disappointed , they just speak to the people and never listen.We as 7 people were expecting the seats in a narrow place, once think about thisIn the mean time I found the subject email, then I showed the email to the waiter, he accepted we were right but there were no place and he could not help us. He told us that were not his fault as his boss Tony Gomez forgot to forward him our booking. He also advised us to discuss with his boss Mr. Gomez. So we had dinner elsewhere. But at least believing we deserved an apology hence we visited the Casa Pepe again. We found Tony Gomez, I have never seen a impudent proprietor like him, I explained him the situation to him and tried to show the email but he told that he did not have the glasses at that moment therefore he could not read it, but he was not polite during this conversation, frequently was shouting to me. I suggested that I could read for him or if he had no trust to me, his assistant could read instant of him who had already read. He shouted me again if I did not understand in French, he renewed that forgot his glasses and could not read. I told that I understood him and reminded that he was not listening to me. Then two rude clients with Spanish accent who were most likely his friends, smirkingly told me ""TU ES ETRANGER ET ZERO POUR LUI, CET HOMME A DE LA SUCCES ET IL SEN FOUT"", which means ""You are foreigner and null for him, this man is very successful and dont care"", moreover they said me TU instead of VOUS, in the meantime Tony Gomez was chuckling to me like a Victorian. Then he showed me the exit. They were being seemed like they were expecting an apology from me. I was deeply disappointed.  Obviously, impudent and racist owners establishments must not be tolerated just because of a doubtful popularity. Please do not go that place and prevent the people who wants to go. If you want I can share my emails as proof."

Two of our group entered the small bar while the others took a seat outside on the surprisingly many empty tables. The waiter approached the two who had entered the bar and shouted 'excuse me, out of my way'. In a typical English way they apologised, despite not being in the wrong, and the barman told them to take a seat outside and they would come and serve us. They never did, and the aggressive waiter came over and shouted at our group for moving a table less than a foot to accommodate our group of six.

Not what I was expecting for that price at all. When we asked politely if we could send it back due to its poor presentation and misleading menu, the waiter told us to wait while he got the manager. As the manager approached our table he screamed at us 'WHAT IS GOING ON WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM!' My friend stayed calm and delicately explained the situation and the manager kept interrupting saying 'no other customers have a problem with this' etc. He eventually aggressively grabbed the plate after screaming at us without us able to get a word in and as he did so I think he muttered something quite racist under his breath. Absolutely disgusting behaviour. He never returned and my friend had to pick at our meals which were fine  nothing special. As we were finishing the manager was just staring at us from a distance with an awful look on his face. We paid the full price but are regretting it.

It was a reunion for us as we haven't seen each other for a long time. 4 of them were in Dublin for the first time on holidays. We ordered some pints, 2 of them just don't drink at all. It was all fine until the ""manager"" came to us and asked from where we were from. After saying we were from Brazil, he simply turned to us and said we had to consume and drink or we had to leave. What made me really upset was that we were consuming and drinking!!!! What did he expect Really heavy drinkers making noise and a mess It was cristal clear the racism against us  brazilians. He came over once again and said that if we didn't get more drinks we had to leave. And at the end, he came over once again, said that the table was ""reserved"" and asked us to leave. Then the bouncer came and asked us to leave the place at all. It was a disgrace!!! It completely ruined our get together and i felt absolutely mistreated. We even went to talk to the police that simply said: try to go to the Temple Bar area and to a better place next time!!! Fail to this pub!!!! never, ever again!"

The porter at the gate asked only me for my papers. I was quite surprised and my friend was also surprised, but I gave my drivers license. The gateman took it and started reading, in a loud voice to everyone, which year I was born and started comparing my age with his age and then he started comparing my age to his wife's age. He was continuing in a loud voice trying to read my social security number and I tried to take my card from his hand telling him he has no right to read my age and the year I was born and all the rest to total strangers I don't know. That is actually against the law in Finland.He then got angry and gave me my card saying I was disrespecting him by trying to take back my card and telling him what he has to do. He then said he is not going to allow me in and did exactly that.I am wondering how a night club in the center of Helsinki will put such racist man at the door Is it just one instant or that is how things are I am going to make sure I spread this everywhere and in every rating agency."

I ordered a takeaway online, everything seemed fine  the payment went through. I then received an email from their payment service, to tell me that the payment had been refunded. I called them  asked them why, they said they do not deliver to my address bearing in mind they have delivered before  it is 3 miles away. At this point, I had already paid the delivery fee. I also left a note to the ""restaurant"" to say could they please come up my driveway  knock on the caravan door at the back. I thought this was strange they said they couldn't deliver to my address, seeing as they had before. Assume it is because they have a dislike for travellers. I then decided to order a takeaway elsewhere, when my card was declined. I then called Al Karim's back, I spoke to a man on the phone, I asked him why the money has not been refunded back into my account, to which his response was ""it takes up to 24 hours, I think"" I then said to the man I need to know a definite answer or when the money will be returned, he then said it could take up to 34 hours. I told the man I needed to know a definite answer, as this is completely unacceptable  also mentioned my point about not delivering to the address because living in caravan. I asked to speak to the manager, but he said he was not there. He said he will look into this for me  then give me a call back. He called me back, said it will be in my account within 24 hours  said he will pass this on to the manager for me. Overall, this has been my worst ever experience with a takeaway, especially when all I wanted was a kebab  now I've got to wait 24 hours to get my money back all because this takeaway is RACIST. I'm also quite sure you can get adequate food from another takeaway who isn't RACIST. "
Restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg294229d2429028r173879304JayaPubJakartaJava.html,Date of visit: August 2013, Jaya Pub ,Asia,Indonesia,Java,unknown,Shocking management,"Firstly the positives This pub looks great, walking through the doors was like stepping back in time. You just don't get pubs like this any more. The two bands who were playing the night we were there were also very good, playing alternating sets every hour and ramping up the energy and atmosphere with each set. Finally, having draft bintang on tap made a nice change from the bottled beer I've got used to over the last ten months in Asia.Now for the negatives The food was overpriced. It was ok, don't get me wrong, but you can eat much better food for far less money elsewhere. Secondly, the management are terrible and their bad attitude and rudeness to nonregular customers ruins the place completely. At the start of the night I would have loved to have given this place 5/5, by the end i was left with little choice but to leave a bad review.Let me explain why; we arrived early, at around 7pm and there were no other customers in there. We asked for a food and drink menu and ordered a couple of beers and some food they told us it wouldn't get busy until 9pm so we thought we may as well stay and eat there to make sure we get a table. We knew it was quite expensive but were happy to stay as the place seemed good.As it started to get busy, and the bands came on, the older lady working the bar began to circulate the area approaching anybody without a full glass and asking if they wanted another. Normally this would be seen as just good service, but it was done in a way that left you in no doubt that not buying another drink would see you asked to leave. After 3 hours of drinking we decided we didn't want any more beers but would just stay and enjoy the music. The woman told us she would close our bill and hinted at the door. This kind of prehistoric attitude doesn't exist in pubs at home any more, or bars anywhere else in Asia for that matter. There was no consideration for the fact we had already spent over 600,000 Rupiah in there!We were a bit taken aback by that but tried to laugh it off. When the bill came, however, everything on it was more expensive than it had appeared on the menu at the beginning of the night, with tax and service added on top for good measure. The tax and service we could live with, its pretty standard in Indonesia. But the pretax price for everything was considerably more than we had been shown at the start of the night. A regular who was sitting next to us and talking to us throughout the night balked at the bill when he saw it and asked if he could check it for us a sure sign that they are known to 'make mistakes' with the bill regularly. In his words, 'that bill looks VERY expensive'. When the manager saw him doing this she came over and aggressively asked if there was anything wrong. We explained the situation and she returned with a menu with stickers over the original prices and said 'these are our prices'. Now, I would be willing to believe that this was an honest mistake but there is no way that they could have given both me and my girlfriend a menu with the wrong and cheaper prices by mistake when we were the only people in the bar at the start of the night. They had us marked down as travellers at the start of the night, and decided to try and make a bit of extra money out of us. The fact that the regular customer sitting next to us wanted to check our bill for us suggests they do this regularly, as did the attitude of the staff to us all night and the fact that they tried to put our card through for payment without a signature or asking me to enter my pin number. The review below says this is a colonial pub with a racist attitude towards Indonesians. I disagree, a lot of the customers were Indonesians. This is a colonial pub with a bad attitude towards nonregular customers. If you live in Jakarta and drink regularly you will be treated like an old friend, if you are passing through and looking for a good night out go elsewhere they will try and rip you off and treat you with contempt."

Unfortunately this turned out to be the worst decision of my trip. Started out promising with good location right smack in the city, awesome decor and atmosphere. However it went downhill from there. Manager led us to a corner table where we had to climb on the barchairs to get in to sit. Even though half of the place was empty. Everything non alcoholic was out except for coke and orange juice when we askedhad too much much to drink the night before. To be fair, the alternating bands were decent and played slow oldies, our taste! Food was a letdown though, I've had better food throughout my trip at a fraction of the prices.Worst part of the experience was paying the bill, manager stood beside us I've never been treated like I have no money to pay before in any restaurant in my life and the worst was right after settling the bill, less than a min the waiter literally shouted at us to leave, just because he needed my chair for another table. This despite just having spent usd30/person.My conclusion: Colonial place with biased colonial service, racist place for caucasians to find company. Decent music, but I've found much better places with quality music, food  definitely service in the north. Ruined our last night out"

Then we told him that, and that we were going to finish our drinks and go and that in 15minutes we would be out of the bar, and he was very rude toward us, he said he didn't need us for anything because he has the students that go there and spent fortunes and not just like a bill of 112CHF like ours! What! Because we are not students, we don't have the right to be treated like people and customers! And he also made racist comments on our ""stupid"" accents like he said. Never again.

My friend and I went on Sunday, June 10, 2018 about 7:45 PM. I have had great service and food in the past, but on this night it was a bad experience . The restaurant was not busy, a usual Sunday night, with adequate serving staff. It took 30 minutes for our waiter take our order. While we were asking questions about the menu the waiter's attitude was impatient and not caring. However a party of 5 Persons next table over, who were of Asian Chinese were cared for by our same waiter with a smile, the waiter dished their food on each guest plate, he communicated asking questions, and giving the party of 5 the royal treatment. Mean while ignoring my friend and I at the next table as we died of thirst. We just wanted a refill on our water which another waiter finally brought at the end of our meal. I mentioned to the other waiter that we were being neglected by our waiter he stated that our waiter was very busy with the party of 5. I don't often say people are racist nor do I ever feel this often in Miami, but I am African American and my friend is Puerto Rican, we are both carmel complexion. On the way out I notice the hostess said good night to all those leaving except to my friend and I. Another reason why I am giving this racist restaurant one star is because the prices are outrageous now, compared to a few years ago the peaking duck was 40, now it is 75. A small plate of Bok choy is now 16  I am sure it's not organic. I will not be supporting this restaurant in the future.

We were both having a different kind of veal CordonBleu. The meat of my accompagn Swiss born was delicious and tender and my meat I'm Austrian was totally different in quality, we both found it inedible. We told the service person and after some quarreling I was served some new meat. The second serving was not only totally burnt on both sides, it was tasting totally different from both kinds of meat we had tried before even though we should have gotten the same meat, it tasted like it was pork this time. I'm not fond of pork meat at all and on top of it it was totally burnt as said and so I had to leave the whole piece untouched. But the worst part came when I was leaving first after ordering the bill to be able to get our cinema tickets in time. The owners of the beiz had apparently started shouting racist insults at me behind my back for not eating their rotten meat and for not keeping quiet after they had served me inedible meat the first time. They did that in front of my accompagn but apparently were too cowardly to do the same thing with me still there.Apparently they do serve good food sometimes too if you're lucky and not from another country than Switzerland, it seems, but after my terrible experience I would recommend noone, especially not a traveller, to waste their time and money there because they're so many restaurants in Zurich that rely on quality and refrain from insulting their own customers."

There were 2 other female staff who were there but seems more interested in what was going on between their colleague and the customers at the bar who were involved in the argument. They didnt have any interest in serving me nor welcoming me to the restaurant.They look miserable and werent friendly I didnt feel welcome. I asked to see the menu and was given one but then no one bother to ask what I wanted to order nor did they offer a table everyone walked passed me as if I was invisible. Then another customer of different ethnic walked up to the bar and from no where a staff came over and bypass me asked the gentleman can I help in which the gentleman replied hes before me referring to me. My experience didnt end there but I had enough when I tried to order and was told in an unfriendly tone that I had to order from her colleague who was at the front I went over to him he then sent me back to his colleague who sent me to him in the first place. At that point I had enough and walked away because I just confirmed these staff are absolute racist,unfriendly, unprofessional and not accommodating.Worst experience I ever had from a restaurant. Avoid this restaurant if youre not white. Thats how they let me feel."

Here as well, any Caucasian person is immediately greeted and served; not the same if you're colored or brown. I was given a table by the entrance which made me uncomfortable as I'm a tall guy and it would require me to move out the way a lot. There were a few empty tables inside, which seated four. The kicker is I saw at least 45 couples seated on such tables. But when I requested them to change my seating, I was refused twice, stating they wanted to 'do business'.I can understand this argument if the said time was a peak time with heavy crowds. But I didn't see any reason why I couldn't sit there when so many others were. Finally after insisting again I got a change in table. Personally, I found that offensive and racist. But maybe it's my perspective. I hope the others who go there have a better experience. Good luck!"

We talked to the waiter just 2mn after ordering, he replied that it was impossible because the software didn't allow cancelling an item. I asked for a manager to help us because he was obviously not trying hard, but he said there is no manager there. He was talking in a very rude way, and insisting that we should go to our hotel to take our wallet and come back, even though it would take 30mn.After his refusal to change the order, we decided to leave. My boyfriend was outside when the waiter came back and told me to ""fuck off"" in a very aggressive way. The guy started shouting at me and abusing me. My boyfriend came back and the waiter started picking a fight by shouting that he should not come there and act as a tourist if he had no money to spend my boyfriend is from India and this comment was clearly racist.A few seconds later, we were in the middle of the street and 2 other waiters were standing there, watching with their arms crossed, while the waiter was threatening to beat up and kill my boyfriend. I was trying to separate them and calm things down, and i got pretty scared that he would beat us both as he was pushing us and was clearly up for a fight. No need to add that this experience left a very bitter taste, as it was not only the consequence of one waiter being rude, but of the fact that none of his colleagues stepped in. The whole staff had no problem with this guy insulting us, being racist and threatening to kill my boyfriend. Unbelievable."

When we arrived we were ignored by staff which we found rude and also we were being judged and stared at by both customers and staff. After ignoring the very rude looks and blatant comments being made by other customers there myself and a friend went to the bar to ask if they had any tables. Again we were completely ignored by staff and found this to be very uncomfortable. A Czech couple then came in behind us after we were waiting approximately 10 minutes whilst being ignored and they served them straight away and took them to a table when they asked. We found this to be racist as the only option that could have been was because we are Scottish. Absolutely horrendous service and we were made to feel so uncomfortable and embarrassed that we had to leave. I would not ever recommend this establishment to anyone and feel that they really should have a lesson in how to treat people. This whole experience we found to be rude, uncomfortable and embarrassing. All who was working there today 30/12/18 should be ashamed. Will never be returning here and will also never recommend to anyone. WOULD GIVE 0 STARS IF THIS WAS AN OPTION. Unfortunately its not so had to give 1 star.

I ordered a takeaway tea and bakery, sat down waiting for someone, and it was cold outside. For starters, they added way too much milk so my tea was undrinkable  though they did change it. Secondly, the waiter was very rude, basically telling me I can't drink in the shop because I didn't pay the service charge. I explained I'm jus waiting and that I'll leave soon once my friend arrives. Thirdly, When she still saw me sitting down she rudely interrupted my phone call, and then huffed and puffed to get her colleague to basically kick me out. Apparently I was drinking the tea in the shop, when really I was stirring in sugars and seeing if it was sweet enough.. I believe this woman was racist because I saw a white man in the shop drinking from a takeaway cup in the shop too. The woman made me feel SO uncomfortable, just staring at me to see if I'm drinking the tea. It's a shame because I actually liked coming here before. Next time, my family and friends will go elsewhere. RACIST BARISTA."

I also understand it was a little shortstaffed, the boss was not around and the 'manager' the skinny, bald african dude wearing a scarf was just Godawful. He was extremely rude and racist. I told them that waiting for 1520 minutes for a bill was a little long and he called me to get lost and that I was being rude and gave me some extreme attitude, then after told me I can't snap my fingers and have things magically appear. First of all, I never once snapped my fingers, I waved once, and once only to tell the waiter I would like the bill, second of all, it was 20 minutes later which I decided to approach them at the bar and ask for the bill.

Ordering the usual lemon tea.. Was given the password..and she left after 45 mins only sipping onto the lemon tea. Our bill was good enough to combine all the foreigners who had come only for wifi.

I totally understand asians all look alike to some people. Nonetheless that doesn't mean they should assume our nationality or discriminate asians. One of the staffs who served my table kept saying hai hai hai hai hai yes yes yes yes yes in Japanese in a highly disrespectful way. and sometimes there was xie xie xie xie thanks thanks thanks thanks in Chinese even after I informed him I'm Korean. I don't expect you to say . Just use English. Will you please. I knew it wasn't him trying to be friendly or anything but just being racist because he said ""sorry sorry sorry sorry"" instead of simple 'excuse me'. And the tea. The tea wasn't served until I finished my main. so I had to order a bottle of water. It wasn't that busy.

And when he finally decided to talk to me, I asked him if he finally decided to see me. He looked at me with an angry blank guilty look and then asks me if I could be kind to him instead after the way I've been treated witnessed by many others waiting for their orders. He has the audacity to ask me to be kind to him while having guilt written all over his face for treating me like dirt.

As proud Brummies, we are fiercely supportive of our multicultural communities and think that the diversity in our region only contributes and strengthens our culture and heritage. There is no need for staff/public facing organisations to convey negative racial overtones. The event was worsened as my companion is of Indian heritage and I was too embarrassed to contest his comment.I hope that the staff member reconsiders making insensitive, racist jibes in future as this is offensive to so many people of mixed cultural heritage as well as those who enjoy being part of a diverse community."

Our steaks were excellent but we thought the wine list was rather pretentious  it seemed to have many hundreds of wines, some over 1000 in price."

I want to share this horrible experience i had today at Jacks. Me and my friends were there for some drinks having a good time, playing pool and domino like we always do. All of the sudden a guy apparently he was the owner that I supposed we all should know and swept the dominos tiles off the table and said get the f out of my bar you russians screaming and cursing us. At first i did not understand what was going on, I thought is just a drunk guy looking for troubles. Then my friend asked him what was his problem. He never explained anything, just being a complete racist, kicked us out. Just to be clear that was not our first time hanging out there, we always behave, never got in trouble, always nice with the staff, just getting together with friends, having a good time, but apparently that fact somehow pissed him off. Well very disappointed, if he is treating all of his costumers like that, then I dont know how he still runs the business. For all this 5 years ive been in this country, this was my first time experiencing this kind of attitude, and I believe that not all the people are like this rude, unprofessional, racist guy named JACK. I really hope all my russian con citizens will keep this in mind when they go there to bring some business to this place. P.s. none of us is from Russia by the way, but I guess that didnt really matter for him, he just had a little bit too much to drink and decided to show some power there. Well done JACK!!!

It was 7:45 pm, we were just finishing our meals, while a Roma family with two kids walked in and looked for a table. My first comment to my friend was look what a nice family, I am so happy that some Roma are so nicely integrated. They apparently came from some kids event as their two daughters had some animal make up, really sweet and well behaved girls. In that moment the head waitress came to them and told them that the restaurant kitchen is closed for maintenance as a hygiene control will come tomorrow and that she cannot serve them any food. They looked really disappointed and as they chose a table next to us, we could hear the entire conversation. The Roma family was very polite even if somehow puzzled. Of course that not even 5 minutes later two other tables got filled and they were served normally. We complaint to our waitress who distanced herself from the management behaviour saying this was just a part time job for her. At least there is some hope in the young generation. I have to say that the guests who were not served were absolutely polite all the time and there was not a hint of any problem in the past. They were Roma and as it has been the case in some Czech restaurants that is enough of a reason for the management to pretend that the kitchen is closed. My recommendation is that if you do not want to support this immoral racist behaviour it is better to avoid this place. There are plenty of good restaurants in Hradec Krlov."

We decided to have dinner at ""Royal Fish."" Upon ordering, I had noticed a worker possibly the manager engage in a few offensive Chinese mimicry as the Chinese customers in front of him were discussing with one another what to order. His fellow workers, the two women cackled. I was at first, most appalled and taken back by this blatant racism, but decided, but I had decided to not start conflict on this day as my family were with me. Then during the meal, while eating, I had witnessed another deplorable incident ensue. One Chinese man was taking his tray to the open area as there were no more seats left. The same worker manager told him that he had to bring it back. The Chinese man assured him he would bring it back. As soon as his back was turned, the manager engaged in another mimicry, rallying laughter with customers. There was so much that I could let slide before this racism surpassed my limits. I decided to discreetly mention it to a different coworker who could pass along the message. I wanted to approach this in a more subtle approach assuming it could be resolved quietly and quickly. Yet, to my surprise, he had accused me of hearing wrong and kept saying ""no"" repeatedly in my face. As a customer service oriented place, I was more than appalled at his behaviour and response. I understood his position to want to defend his work place, but his unmitigated gull of dismissing my paying customer accusations and belittling me in front of others was absolutely humiliating. As a worker, I find that the Chinese tour groups are one of the top contributors to sales, so to be racist, seems ironic. Furthermore, standing by Markthal's appreciation of multiculturalism through diverse restaurants and stands, this an abhorrent act. I expect nothing short of a proper apology because this has been one of the worst experiences in the Netherlands and it is an unnecessary experience my family will take back with them. It is unfortunate as I believe this is not a representation of the values and beliefs Markthal holds to be true."

We waited 10 minutes before someone came  to even greet us. I kept turning around to look at the manager who was by the cash register, not doing anything. Finally, someone came to take our order. They were a little busy, so at first I gave them the benefit of the doubt. However, I watched 3 sets of people sit down at the tables directly around us. Each time, they were greeted and brought chips immediately. The manager, barely uttered two words when he brought our food to the table. The other servers kept walking past our table, rudely asking if we needed boxes while we were obviously still eating. As if trying to hurry us out of their establishment. I ordered nachos and found a pebble, yes an actual ROCK in my food. I called the manager over and asked why we were being treated in this way. He apologized but mind you, this is the same person who stood there just looking at us after we sat down. The bottom line is we were the only Black people there and were not given the same service as the people seated around us. We were treated this way, from the moment we walked in the door. So, the only explanation is THEY DO NOT WANT BLACK PEOPLE IN THEIR RESTAURANT!! The only people I saw working in there were Hispanic, so I know they must know how it feels to be discriminated against. So, why turn around and be racist when they already know how it feels Hey patzcuaro's, treat others how you would want to be treated and STOP BEING RACIST AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE!!"

They came in 5 minutes after me and not once ever heard them ask for a booth since we all waited in the front. So I ask her I thought this table was reserved and these women came in after me I never heard them ask for a booth. And there were 2 other booths available. She stumbled over her words and I said I'm leaving, this is discrimination. I talked to the manager and mentioned how we were being discriminated, it's wrong. He was speechless as we walked out. I contacted Jack's corporate and still have yet to hear an apology. I'm Asian by the way and feel my money is not welcomed here. After years of giving my hard earned money, and family dinners and lunches, that comes out to 3,000.The fact they continue to employ this RACIST host means they condone this behavior.

The sushi chef is racist against Asian who doesn't speak Japanese. I would give 5 stars if I could.Me and my friend decided to go with the all you can eat sushi package. During the meal I found out the Chef has been giving us small portion of fish and big portion of rice.We also ordered the all you can drink package. I asked for a refill for my oolong tea and ordered a highball. When the drinks arrived, the sushi chef was mad and speaking Japanese with his finger pointing at me. Then he told the server to come and take away my drink. The server explained to me that I can only order 1 drink at a time, alright I got it but it wasn't disclosed anywhere and come on it's only ice oolong tea I thought in Japanese culture, it is rude to use your finger to point at anyone I felt he is disrespectful and want to kick us out ASAP.I would never come back or recommend this place to anyone... oh well, I guess unless you speak Japanese."

But we had a TERRIBLE experience with the waitresses. One seemed completely UNFRIENDLY and the other had a NEUTRAL attitude towards us. We felt discriminated against. After we had left, we had forgotten one of our belongings there. It took 15 minutes to be attended to. During the time, the waitress just waved us off from a far to signal we should leave, without listening to what we had to say. Finally we got the package THROWN OUT TO US outside and one lady gave us the finger. I might go as far saying they were a little bit racist."

The owner Jeff is a racist and a bigot. The cakes weren't anything special and were very dry. The decor was nice but just because you have a nice ambiance doesn't mean you can be rude to your customers. For Sugar land to be a very diverse city, this place does not belong in it with a racist owner."

We went to the bag/purse section of the shop with the intent to buy, however, we were ""greeted"" like we were interupting her from her leisurely ""work"". Prior to that we saw her chit chatting with another staff when we approached that area could be the reason for her rude behaviour. On top of that she made faces which looked very rude, in disgust and racist as if we were inside the wrong shop. The worst part of that experience, which I would never forget, was that when we found the item we thought we'd purchase....with anger and annoyance in her voice, asked ""what's wrong with that"". I was about to purchase over a 1,000 bag and would like a non displayed item. What's wrong with that!!!! With hundreds of businesses closing each week, can a customer at least purchase something they like. a rude and racist female staff approach "

We eventually got in as he continued his horrible manners and tone. As i waited outside, he came into the women washroom with my grandma and sister still inside with absolutely no permission, knowing very well how much we value conservatism and violating our privacy saying ""it's my business, i need to check if it's clean."" At this point, we head to the door leaving the washroom spotless and I ask him to treat his customers better and he raises his voice in attempt to embarrass us in front of the customers. My father came in for an explanation as the manager said ' I don't allow muslim women into the bathroom' and proceeded to say 'I don't care' when we said he will be reported. I am disgusted and shaken by this racist treatment. DO NOT ENCOURAGE THIS BY GOING THERE"

I told him that the sign outside said that they closed at 10pm last order 9.30pm. The cashier glared at me and just ignored me entirely. After I left the reception area, I saw that other people Japanese would arrive and ask for a table without reservation and was allowed to enter.I have no doubt that the cashier was a racist who denied me entry simply because I was not Japanese."

I believe they must do this regular on saturday nights to what appear easy pickings to them,but I dont know that for sure but judging by the negative feedbacks left online its a good guess.The police came took us to one side said ,its a civil matter but genuinely off the record we have been called hwere a few times , read the reviews on trip advisor and dont go back and leave your own review, so this is what we have done.The saddest part of the whole affair was when they realised we were not easy pickings one started saying ""why are you being racist why are you being racist to me!""

The hostess was, to put it plainly, racist. I am Indian, and I have spent 25 years in the US and all over the world. I have never said something blunt like this about anyone . But, in this case, it is the simple truth. First, she did not believe we had a reservation, till she checked, but even then she would not seat us in the main dining area. Still, not wanting to spoil a good evening with friends, we asked for Pintxos and agreed to sit at the bar. She pointed us to the display on the countertop. We had to pick the ones we wanted, ""by hand"" her words, from the displayed ones. And indeed they were stake a week old or so it seemed. Pretty bad. Topped up with a dash of good old racism. "

We walked in and asked for a table of two, there were a few spare tables...all not cleaned. He said to give him two minutes he will get one ready for us. My boyfriend had a bad knee injury so sat down at one of the tables while we waited for it to be cleaned and I stood next to him. The waiter then went over to a table of Spanish guests, talking to them for about 15 minutes, laughing and just looking over at us. By this point I said I will clean the table myself and moved some of the plates to the other table...another Spanish couple walked in and I couldnt believe what happened next. He ran over and got the table ready for them and started serving them instead while we hadnt even got a menu yet. It was obvious he didnt want us there an English interracial couple didnt fit into his kind of restaurant. We got up and walked out...and as we left he shouted thank you come again and started laughing! Absolutely disgusting service, vile racist staff! you all need to get over yourselves and walk into 2017 not everyone in this world is Spanish and white!!"

The attendant at the door was very rude and asked us if we had informed anyone we were planning to be late. When we replied that we thought someone from the restaurant would call us, she told us it was not her responsibility to inform us but rather the call center's responsibility. As we were waiting for the attendant to come up with a solution for us we have 2 babies under 2 and changing restaurants is no easy task!, the attendant politely attended to other guests. The attendant Filipino was in my opinion racist yes, I know this is a serious allegation, as she was very polite and smiley to the other Caucasian guests. After much discontent, she finally called the manager and managed to find us a table it was then 12pm that she said we needed to clear out of by 12.45 for a 1pm reservation. We thought rushed but doable, but when we reached the table, we found a dead cockroach on the chair gross!!. We immediately called the attendant back who then called the manager. The manager gave a curt apology and swiped up the cockroach with a napkin. I really wished I had taken a picture!! Still we thought we would stay and have a quick lunch since our babies were growing increasingly impatient. We asked for our order to be taken and waited 10 minutes, then we went to the manager again to ask him to find someone to take our order and his reply was ""I'm sure my staff will get to you soon."" This was now 12.15pm. Mind you we had arrived to the restaurant at 11.50am. Anyone with screaming impatient babies can understand that an over 25 minute wait to be seated and for orders to be taken is simply impossible. But added to that the racist attendant, nonchalant manager, and the lack of hygiene, and you have a restaurant that we will never visit again.If Tripadvisor had negative stars, I would have rated it a negative star."

Very romantic with lovely views over the Indian Ocean. The coffee is lovely. Nothing better than to sit at the beautiful place with ones loved one and sip a lovely coffee. Only one problem, to really enjoy this place you have to be white. True, these guys are very racist. I will mention my experience. My wife and I went to the lounge room upstairs that has a couple of air conditioners keeping the room nice and cool and has a glass pane at the front from which you can enjoy the magnificent view. A caucasian man was seated on the sofa just in front of the air conditioner. As my wife and I admired the view from the glass pane, this man vacated the sofa and left so we took up this place as it was just in front of the air conditioner and was a comfortable place to be seated at. We placed our orders, and a couple minutes later a staff member came and switched the AC off. Upon questioning him about why he put it off, he simply said that it was faulty and could not be used it just happened to get spoiled after the caucasion left. I was very much irked by this and asked in a loud voice if I had to be white to have the the pleasure of the comfort of the AC. Upon feeling that the matter may get out of hand, they switched the AC back on again. Before writing this review, I have noted that someone else has also had a racist experience here as well. I am shocked that to this day and age, there is still such a major colonial hang over that racism in places like these persists!"

Not taking booking,"What a racist restaurant. I never felt the racism in my 11 years in UK. But in wroclaw felt in first 4 days in this restaurant. I am Indian by birth, and went on to make a booking on friday for 2 of us in the restaurant for Saturday night. I was told that its full and no table available. Fair enough, its Saturday night. I asked for Sunday evening. I was told that also full. That's sounds fishy. I asked for any day available next week but I was told that whole week is full. The person tried to turn the pages to show that its full. I am not sure what he thought, but I can see that only 2 or 3 tables are full each day. And surely there are much more tables available in the restaurant. So, I felt that just because of my skin color I was told that no table available for us."
