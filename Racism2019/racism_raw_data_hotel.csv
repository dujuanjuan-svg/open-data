MAY 2015,"EDIA PULLER, LLYANA PULLER DO NOT COME TO THE ISROTEL RIVIERA CLUB HOTEL 8N EILAT if you want a family vacation and you are a person of color. I am a single mother  and for the first time in 9 years we I had a chance to reunite with my children for a few days in Eilat at the Isrotel Riviera Club hotel. All of my daughters live in a different country from me. Were 4 people in a room. We also have friends and relatives that live in Eilat. In addition my daughters' suitcase never arrived So other people had to provide her with her daily requirements. From the moment we arrived the security staff hounded us and aggressively verbally confronted us everytime we exited or entered the hotel. Never once did they try to have a respectful conversation with us about whatever it was they were having an attitude about. When in turn we confronted the security staff about their behavior and blatent racial profiling their comment was...""well no we dont check everyone"". And in these times of extreme racial tension in Israel you would think a hotel like ISROTEL that deals with international clientel would require a little more proffesionalism and manners from their staff."

During that stay, I encountered the blatant bigotry and racial bias that seems to be commonplace at Marriott properties in the South. I requested as always, a top floor room as is saved in my member profile. As a Platinum Premium Elite Member, this should not be a problem. The Hispanic front desk female attendant tells me that the top floor was under repair and not being used, which I later learn was a blatant lie. When the room above me was assigned to a family three days later with children running around the room, I confronted the attendant. When I voice my displeasure with her having lied and that I was leaving, she canceled my reservation. Moreover, Marriott did not credit me with the reward points for my stay. I called Marriott customer service and received the same indifference, which leads me to believe its a corporate culture issue. The mold and mildew smell that permeates the property in South Florida is enough of a reason for me to never return given my Asthma. But the blatant bigotry and racial bias sealed it."

I was thrilled and couldnt wait for a winter wonderland weekend.  Sadly Mother Nature didnt play into the fun seeing as there has been no snow here in Minnesota all through December and into January, but the trip was already booked, so we headed up there this past weekend.  What a thoughtprovoking experience, the lodge claimed that we would have a fireplace king suite except for the fact that the fireplace didnt work! The rooms temperature was horrible! We could never get the room at a comfortable level because the gauge to the thermostat was also broken.  In addition we were on the lower level which is fine if it hadnt been right directly in front of the stairs so throughout the stay we could hear people coming and going.  Also, there werent that many guests present so how ironic that we happened to get a family directly placed above us.  The insulation needs to be updated because every time someone walked around upstairs it was very disturbing because you felt like they were going to fall through and that made it difficult to rest peacefully.  Likewise, we were quite astonished with the service at the restaurant attached to the lodge.  We had been given a voucher for dinner during checkin and decided to use it that following night.  The service was ok, we enjoyed the food and tipped our waitress at 30 mind you but once she collected her earnings we were useless to her.  She never returned to our table to check up  see if we needed anything else additionally or even gave us a thank you for our generous tip.  Regardless, because the food was so wonderful we thought we would try eating there the next night.  Wrong idea! Once we arrived we were disregarded almost immediately by Doreen Gallawaythe head of the wait staff.  She tried to make a scene but we read her energy as soon as we stepped in the door and by that I tell you, she made it quite clear blacks were unwelcome.  That woman needs a lesson in racial competence, she was extremely rude and clearly based on our interaction with her, has serious issues with cultural acceptance; Looking down on us because we were a biracial couple as well of the fact that Im a woman of color.  She also tried embarrassing us in front of everyone by making a scene because we had a preference of where we wanted to sit for dinner and started berating her waitress right in front of usunprofessional, quite unnecessary and classless is how I would some up her personality.  Funny some people are still so ignorant, Doreen Gallaway is an illustration of someone who sees color vividly and anyone with differences should be looked down upon and less than because they arent white.  For that reason alone I would give this lodge a poor rating because if they are willing to staff individuals who have serious identity issues and discriminate their guests based on their racial or cultural backgrounds, I think that shows the integrity of this establishment.  Needless to say, we will not be visiting that location again and if youre expecting a romantic getaway and youre a person of color, or in a biracial relationship, be prepared to be mistreated and disregarded by lowgrade, uneducated, country bumpkins who havent realized that its 2012 and times have changed."

Nevertheless we never wanted to make an Issue as that was our Honeymoon and not to upset our self.  At mid night around 12.30 pm we got hungry and went to the Front desk, at check in we were assured that front is 24 hours operational, since there was no internal phone connection working out of order, we were forced to walk towards the front and to our surprise there was no one at the desk, when we look around we found a staff member a thin tall guy in dark blue uniformed sleeping in a couch. We got scared and walked away. We never wanted to comment about this to the check out Clark but thought of sharing on trip advisor, so the Couples who are going to spend the honeymoon knows what they would get at this place   "

Get out of here, or I will call police!' I was shocked and scared to go out to wait my friend. He followed behind me to the door and yelled again 'you cannot stand in front of my house. Get away from the door'. He left until I used my phone to film him. His behaviour is too rude and racial discrimination to a customer.

I arrived at the Nomad hotel around 2.30 PM yesterday and was told by the receptionist that check in was at 4 PM and that no rooms were available yet. I walked to a seat to wait, letting the Caucasian couple behind me have their turn at the counter. The couple had also just arrived from the airport with all their bags. I expected them to be told to wait as I had been, but instead, I watched as they were checked in and given a key by the same receptionist. I was stunned. I went up to the receptionist and asked why the couple had been given a room immediately if check in was at 4 PM and there were no rooms available just minutes ago. She coldly said that they requested for an early check in during booking. Did they really I told her to check my booking again because I had also requested the same during booking. She had no response. Racists usually dont. For the record, Im an Asian female who was traveling solo. I speak English fluently, have clean hair, and was traveling light. I had just gotten off 20 hours of travel so it wasnt a pleasant ordeal to have to fight for equal treatment at your hotel. Racism is exhausting. Five minutes after I confronted your receptionist, she magically came up with an available room. No apologies. Later on in my room, I looked up your website and discovered something more appalling. Your hotel check in time is at 2 PM. Not 4 PM. Another person on your staff confirmed it for me too. The discrimination was obvious. I wont go into how this incident made me feel, but Im sure your goal as a hotel isnt to make guests feel unwelcome and secondrate. While I hesitate to blame an entire hotel for the action of one employee, there was at least one other employee who was aware of what was happening and heard as I was told that check in was at 4 PM. Racism never makes sense, but its unbelievable that anyone would think a paying Asian guest isnt good enough for equal treatment at a nofrills, airport hotel. So for the benefit of anyone considering your property, I would appreciate a response here explaining your policies and procedures  if any  against discrimination and intolerance. I stayed at the Nomad hotel out of necessity for transit, but even for necessity, I do not recommend it unless your policies clearly protect against discrimination by anyone yes, including customers at your properties."

She complied with signing it and completed the check in process. Once I parked the car and came in I needed to stop at the desk. While I was waiting I witnessed 2 white men check into 2 different rooms and he never asked either of them how many people nor did he require them to sign a waiver. He only asked each of them  how many keys they needed. Later theis evening while talking with some others that traveled with us we made a disturbing discovery. All the black people that checked in were repeatedly asked how many people will be staying in their rooms. They all were required to sign this no party waiver.

I am an Asian American and I was the only Asian I could see that day staying at this hotel.  I noticed instantly that the staff treat the German speakers way more friendly than me.   Not only with a bad attitude, they put me in a single tiny room despite I clearly booked a double room with a double bed via Expedia.   I called Expedia twice and they confirmed that I did book a room with a double bed but the staff and manager insisted that I had booked a single room.   It took me more than an hour communicating to them and Expedia back and forth and finally they reluctantly agreed to put me in a double room, which I had originally reserved.   The manager seemed surprised hearing me speak to Expedia on the phone in perfect English and that I live in America, and it was clear to me that was the reason why they changed their mind.   So, for non German speakers, especially Asians, please do take the racial profiling and discrimination into consideration if you are considering this hotel.    I will NEVER stay here again. Location wise, this hotel is very far way from the two center where all the restaurants and places of interest are located.   It was very inconvenient.  The so called black forest view is a joke.  The view was not good at all.  Very average and not worth of being so far away from the town center.  There are plenty of good hotel choices in the town center.  I would highly recommend against staying a this hotel.  "

I was approached by a man by the name of David Cox, a Hispanic man in his mid 20s early 30s on November 8th initially he politely asked if I needed any assistance where I replied ""no I do not, thank you"" when I continued to walk around the premises among a good percentage of the other visitors as their was some sort of banquet taking place on the lower levels David once again approached me when I found a spot to sit near the restaurants where there were complementary couches for what I could only gather were for business where he then aid I would have to leave the establishment. At this point I could only grow agitated however keeping my composure as I had a conference call to discuss on vacation I kindly decided to not go through the hassle of arguing my point with this man as to why I was singled out among about another hundred more individuals mostly not of color knowing the racial climate of Los Angeles California. But if I were to be asked if this was an experience that I enjoyed a definite no. We came here to escape from the same treatment at other establishments in Los Angeles in the past. In light of the racial bias in Los Angeles from it's less than perfect history I'd definitely recommend the Ritz Carlton for an event free experience as even your profession can be a burden on vacation at times definitely a warmer, smoother environment for all demographics to enjoy."

This is such a ridiculous way of treating platinum members. The housekeeping supervisor said she will ask the general manager to contact me, but nobody reached out after over 2 weeks.  I logged a ticket on the SPG site which was ignored for months and 5 round of follow ups.  The GM reaches out offering no proper apology nor recognition of what happened, offers measly 9,000 points which he never even deposited and stopped responding.  Stay away from SPG properties, especially this one.  I was never treated by Hilton / Marriott this way."

There were some confusion with payment at check out and the gentleman reception was extremely rude to us, he demanded for us to show our bank statements for one room that was prepaid. He also accused us of lying and was not helpful in resolving the matter at all. His exact words were Look, if you walk out of the door now and refuse to pay, we would still charge the money out of your credit card. I was so embarrassed, and in disbelief how can he talk to anybody like this.  We had good intentions to pay and were very polite to him, we only wanted to resolve the matter. I insisted he check on his system again for the payment, and after asking 3 times he looked and found out one room had already been paid for. The Italian restaurant also refused to give us a table, and I had to ask the hotel staff to help us. Eventually the manager gave us a table and in a rude manner he told us we had to order one main each. They were bullying, the feeling of racial discrimination and being accused of lying.  I can not believe how we were treated by a hotel such as Movenpick.  This kind of customer service is unacceptable and we will never return again."

THE WORST HOTEL IN THE WORLD,"Hello,I am glad that I have had an opportunity to give a feedback. I only wish that the owner/senior management of the hotel reads this. We checkedin on the 04th Oct for 5 nights till 09th Oct 2016 and stayed in room number 410.I and my wife are doctors, surgeon and a physician respectively, originating from India, settled in Canada. We are widely traveled, to over 97 countries with several dozen bookings from Booking.com. I want to state that I went through the worst humiliation and racial abuse at this hotel. The matter was brought to the notice of Mrs Dilek, Manager, personally, who promised of action but was repeated again and again for the next two days. When we checked in I had the worst of experiences. The receptionist was unwelcoming, outright rude, making fun of our origin, asking if we were Muslims and then mocking at the negative reply...... After checkingin we asked if tea can be given. The receptionist while we were at the lobby answered that there is no tea and this is not a tea shop like you have in India. Trying not to make a scene we avoided contact with the reception. However he once shouted at my wife, ""Oh Lady come here"". We avoided all contact and insinuation.On the 06th night, can be verified from the calls to the reception, I requested if the wifi can be made ok, as the wifi in Room 410 is pretty weak and would turn off by itself. The receptionist shouted...""So  what can I do .... Tell anyone else...whole city like this."" I believe the hotel has a recording of all conversations. Please do check this. All incidents till this point were personally informed to the manager, Mrs Dilek. She noted the details on a paper, but no action was taken, as the abuse persisted.Before checkout I had sent a mail for checkout at 1.00 pm. This had been personally approved by the manager. However when I told the receptionist at 10.30 am that I would leave the room by 1.00 pm, he was so rude, saying that there is no manager here, today is Sunday and only he is the boss and made fun of me, making faces, mocking me. I felt like reporting him to the police for his behavior. He said what do you think of yourself I also traveled to USA, Europe...don't think much of yourself and so very much more. ""Make sure that you are here at the reception before 1.00 pm or else...We are doctors, done fairly well for ourselves, financially very well off. One does not expect that from a receptionist. Some dignified reply, some decency, and most of NO ABUSE ON ACCOUNT OF MY SKIN COLOR OR RELIGION, is  least one expects in any reputable hotel.I have never stayed in a hotel with such poor reception staff. I wish I had not stayed at Deluxe Golden Horn Hotel.IF EVER I COME TO ISTANBUL AGAIN, I SHALL NEVER EVEN GO NEAR DELUXE GOLDEN HORN HOTEL, LET ALONE, STAY THERE.WHY DOES THE MANAGEMENT NOT REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT, A WELL DONE UP PLACE, WITH THE BEST LOCATION IN ISTANBUL, WITH EVERYTHING ELSE GOOD, HAVE A LOW RATING ON VARIOUS SITES. REFLECT AND DELIBERATE ON THIS, YOU WILL SEE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE RECEPTIONISTS RESPONSIBLE. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, I AM DONE WITH THIS HOTEL. HOWEVER BEFORE I CLOSE THIS CHAPTER, I SHALL SEND A DETAILED COMPLAINT, INCLUDING TWO AUDIO RECORDINGS OF THE RECEPTIONIST TO THE CONCERNED MINISTRY OF TOURISM. I SHALL REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR ANY INVESTIGATION BY THE MINISTRY, EVEN TRAVEL TO ISTANBUL AGAIN TO FACILITATE THE INVESTIGATION, AS I HAVE BEEN DEEPLY HURT.Dr Sanjay Khanna"

There was a spider trapped in there and an insect. We have just come for dinner and wanted to sit at a certain table they told us no it's booked by their guests staying with them!

Told the attended who said she didnt drink milk. SO She replaced the milk and we had breakfast. The next morning, the same think, skim milk was sour and had to be replaced. I suggest to the same attendant that she should have maintenance check the refrigerator if the dates on the milk cartons was good. She replied that the refrigerators were fine. The next morning, guess what, the milk was again sour and a different attendant agreed that either the milk had expired or the refrigerator needed to be checked. I suggest that if you must stay in a Comfort Inn, go to the other one in Galveston. This one wont see me back."

We slept through the night  and excitedly woke up the next day to have some yoga sesh with my girlfriends. We hurriedly went to the seaside to catch the sunrise and went back to the hotel room to get ready for breakfast. We  fully understand that part of the hotel protocol is to ensure the safety of the Guests. Securities has the right to ask questions needed for security purposes,But the securities have gone overboard. Whenever we are in sight, they'd come and ask if we've got a room  rude manner. Not once, Not twice but at least 10x or more. We felt humiliated, insulted  and started feeling sorry for ourselves by the way they approached us. We really  felt we're not welcome in the premises. When  they see Arabs in the same place we were in, they don't ask them, they approached  us instead.  Why because we are group of Filipinos This is a simple form of racial discrimination. We paid the same amount, we are all guest, We also deserve to be treated with respect.  This is unacceptable behavior from the hotel staffs.We expected too much from a five star hotel and to our dismay, they treated us poorly..In additional, towels were smelly, toiletries are not really good. we booked 3 dbl rooms. each room should have 2 bath towels. bath rubs and slipper but only one was provided each room.

Duty Manager, Mr. Farruh Nabiev demonstrated a racial profiling when I brought Master Card ATM was being out of service last 5 days to his attention while he was at helm in the lobby. He stated that Its not even available for our guest. He assumed that I wasnt a guest because of my national origin. In my opinion, anyone who visits your property either to stay, dine or use any paid services should be considered as a guest. He was very rude and unprofessional. This hotel considered to be a five star but his service was below one star. I was simply bringing the issue to his attention so it will get fixed but he didnt care, not only that but he was so rude during the entire conversation. He didnt even apologize for the inconvenience and didnt even offer an assistance to find an ATM nearby. Ive stayed many upscale hotels where Duty Managers were at helm to greet and engage with guests to ensure that guests are well looked after. Sadly he was measurably failing to look after his guests and being extraordinarily Duty Manager. It was also sad, no one seemed care about the first impression, as walking in to the hotel main entrance, Ive noticed cigarette butts all over. There were 3 door men but none of them were greeting or offering an assistance instead they were just standing and chatting. Since I was very disappointed with his lack of customer service and respect, Ive asked a contact number for the hotel General Manager but Mr. Nabiev refused to provide. If you wish to learn more in details about my experience please have someone from guest relationships contact me at 8003479802."

I had a similar poor experience at that locale just a few short months prior so I was very suspicious. I told him that since this has occurred before I am being to notice a trend and that I question whether he is catering for only a specific clientele. He did not disagree. He simply said ""oh don't say that"" while smiling. He even suggested I try one of the other establishments close by! The message I got was I don't serve your kind here. I am not in a habit of believing that I am being treated differently due to race but I feel fairly confident that this is what occurred on this occasion.Sad to be treated in this way by a foreigner in my own country.I want to share the information so that it will not occur to others.

Yesterday04/10/2018 was our last night in Switzerland, staying at Eden Palace au lac hotel, the best position beside lake Geneva and we have already paid the fee in advance. There are two staffs at the reception table, one male and one female with white short hair. She asked for our booking information and  told us we have to go to another Hotel named Hotel du Grand Lac Excelsior, which location was quite different from the original one. We asked the reason and she said the whole rooms on the third floor were flooded with water and they were not able to offer any rooms.Since we have ordered the room month ago and we did not receive any email or phone calls in advance. We required to see the problem  of the room on the third floor, they refused with no patience and said the hotel manager could come to solve this. At this point, the woman's attitude became very bad, and she started to communicate with the man in French. She even throw things on the reception desk deliberately!When we were waiting for the manager, a British man was warmly welcomed and successfully checked in to the room on the forth floor.Then the reception told us that the hotel manager was busy and will not come to see us. We feel very sad because we received no RESPECT at all.The reception desk of their hotel has a key counter, anyone who leaves the hotel should keep the key at the reception. Then we asked the male staff why the keys of the third floor were only six on the shelf The rooms need fix and so do the keys His faced turned red immediately and he could not even say one word! Then he explained that there were only six rooms unavailable on the third floor! He was telling lies!The female worker is very impatient to say that she did nothing wrong, so did we. And the ""decision"" was not made by her, she could not change the result and we have no options. I guess it was a very interesting decisionWe finally asked three questions.1. We booked the hotel a few months in advance, and you didn't inform us in advance, even not inform us during the day, could you explain it2. At the beginning, you said there was a problem with the whole floor, and then it became only six rooms. You lied to your customers3. British people can check in even later than us, Chinese can't Do you discriminateThe man can't answer any of my questions, his face was totally red. And the woman was  already exasperated to leave the reception desk.I had a look on the third floor and took some pictures. Everything was in good condition. From the outside of the hotel, I could see three rooms on the third floor with lights on. After more than an hour, we knew that the results would not change, and we decided to change hotel because we have four elder people in our family. But the rights issue has not ended and all the evidence have been preserved. We need an Official Apologize from the hotel because it did hurt our feelings and it is indeed racial discrimination!!"

If you believe in treating people from different countries and cultures equally, avoid this place.  If you don't care about that and are of Indian origin or at least look like you are, it's not bad and you shouldn't experience any discrimination.  I just don't feel good supporting a hotel that believes discriminating is acceptable.  I was even told management supports this kind of behavior.  The 6th floor of the hotel stinks horrifically in the halls.  It will make you feel sick to your stomach just walking to your room.  The decor and electrical are horribly outdated.  The rooms are all very dark even with every light on due to the lack of modern electrical wiring to support more lighting."

We did feel a very weird dynamic here between the white receptionist and the black employees.  As a multiracial couple, the woman at the front desk ignored the person of color in our party almost entirely, and when she needed to ask questions, directed them to the white person.  The treatment of the black staff was uncomfortable, especially the way they were spoken to in front of guests, and we noticed this within our first 10 minutes of being here.  The rooms were large, though none had air conditioning we stayed in two different rooms on either end of our stay in Joburg and it was extremely hot in both rooms, and the last one had a timer on the lights where they would strobe starting at 3am and there was no way to get them to stop.  This location came highly recommended to us, and while we loved our stay in Melville, would not stay at the Space Guest House or recommend it to friendsespecially if they are traveling with people of color.  We considered canceling our reservation postsafari, but felt it would be too much of a hassle and, unfortunately, decided to stay another two nights in this location.  All in all, our experience here was extremely uncomfortable, and we will not be coming back."

I called Paul a few days ago to inquire about 2 rooms for me my wife and my parents who would meet us from Gujarat, India.Paul told me to send an email with the dates. He replied the next day saying there was no availability for the dates between 69 Jan. I sent another email the next day asking if there was any other date after 6th up to 15th that was available. Never got a reply from him.Now it gets interesting. My wife who is caucazian, called Paul and ask for the dates of 6th through 9th over the phone. He knew she is American because of her accent. Reply to her email from her personal email about availability was positive with openings for 2 rooms starting 7th of January!Just to give him benefit of doubt, I sent him an email from my email account asking for any other dates than 6th of Jan and the reply again was a resounding ""No"" for dates up to 15th.I understand this place has received great reviews from people who stayed there. But tho owner of this so called ""ecofriendly"" place never even gave us a chance to stay there. We do not support racial discrimination at any level and decided not to take this place."

Upon arrival we were thrilled to find champagne  a tin of biscuits  nougat in our room as a congratulatory gift from Roger, the manager. The food was consistently excellent, the staff were efficient  friendly, our room was spotlessly clean with a breathtaking view of the Berg. However, we were saddened by a racial incident that marred our stay. On the last evening we went down to dinner early in order that we might secure a particular table we desired. After having placed our drinks order with Thandi, who removed the extra plates  serviettes, we went to help ourselves at the buffet. On returning we found two men seated at our table. We spoke to Richard, the supervisor, who refused to move them because, in his words, ""it might cause an incident"". On one of the previous evenings we observed Richard requesting another white couple to move as a black couple were already seated at that particular table. When the waitress returned she placed our drinks at their table  was surprised when I told her that we were no longer sitting there as two black men were now occupying the table of our choice. Thandi said that this was nonsense  asked the men if they would move, which they did. We remained at another table because we had by now already started eating. Thandi was highly efficient  attentive  handled the incident with politeness  graciousness. She was extremely apologetic for something that was not her fault. We felt that it was because we were white that nothing was done to rectify the situation caused by Richard's refusal to act. Why should a waitress have to deal with a situation when the supervisor should have sorted out Because of this I would hesitate to return to the resort. Just one more irritation.....the WiFi is extremely erratic."

The group needs to attend to this resort urgently before it is embroiled with racial discrimination and inconsiderate preferential treatment of other races above others. The medium of language should be English otherwise all 11 South African official languages should be used as I believe  I am a Zulu speaking South African and English is not my first language so as Afrikaans speaking people they also need to adapt and consider others as well. The forever resort should attend to this as the guests are only the recipients of the culture which the resort promotes. Putting a black South African to entertain Afrikaans speaking people only is a bad disguise to the culture that is not inclusive of other races

My family and I wanted to extend a room until 5 pm for checkout, which was clearly asked at the reception desk a day before. The receptionist knew that there were no more rooms for us, but told us to ask for extension the next day morning anyway. When we asked for room extension the next morning, another receptionist told us that all the rooms were fully booked. We then asked to leave for the airport at 12 pm but was promptly rejected by the receptionist. The receptionist told us that they scheduled us for 5 pm, without our consent, and denied any changes to be made.On the other hand, one of the staff threw rude words at us when 5 of our people who are staying at Beach Villa visited the other 6 people at Ocean VIlla. The staff scolded us that we were not allowed to enter, even with the our family members' consent they were staying at Ocean Villa, in three different rooms. The service staff at Ocean View treated us like criminals, watching our every move. I feel extremely uncomfortable and even threatened by the way they treat us.Secondly, we felt a strong racial discrimination between a few service staff that held higher positions.  Besides that, most of the service members did not smile nor show enthusiasm in serving us, but were kind and polite to guests from Western countries. For instance, one of the service staff that helped us get on the boat blocked some of our family members from getting on the boat first and let the other Westerners go on board first. They only relented unwillingly when we told them we are a family and should board the boat together.Third but not last, the living standards are not worth the price we paid. We requested an extra bed for one of the rooms in the Beach Villa, which I slept in, but the bed spring was damaged. The two nights were absolutely horrible for me, and I did not sleep well at all. Besides that, the waiters at the restaurant were terrible as well. A glass of water might as well take eternity to come as some of the waiters pretended not to see us or waited until our section's waiter came to serve us.There are still a lot of problems with the management at this resort that are not stated here. The manager at the resort definitely has issues with management and should be removed or at least sent for management classes. I urge Adaaran Select Hudhuranfushi's owner to take immediate action and offer compensation for our unpleasant stay."

The casino and bar are clean, nice, a bit crowded. The bar server was very nice and the service was fast. : They have Starbucks on the second floor, and a few coffee places downstairs.To our surprise, when we were checking out, we were charged  almost 50 for some refreshments that we never had. But took a phone call to resolve the issue gonna check my credit card in a few days just to be sure they took the charges off. So make sure you are not charged for anything extra. I provided my @ address to check out, so they sent me an @ in the morning with the bill to review. So far, the experience is great! Looking forward to stop here again sometimes in the future.The only concern throughout the whole trip: looks like Las Vegas is turning into Beijing. 75 of all people there  are Chinese!! My family is multiracial and we have no racial issues with anyone, but we were surprised to see so many Chinese faces around. Even the checkin line in Aria had at least 70 Chinese guests"

THIS NEEDS TO BE SAID.The pool staff in the 'quiet' pool were rude, aggressive and showed little to no compassion telling an English child under the age of 15 that the pool was prohibited, how do i know this, two of my children were subjected to this treatment, one of whom you may see later making their own review. When confronted and the evidence of racial bias regarding treatment of French guests vs English guests, was met with frantic words in french on a walkie talkie which sent an assistant manager poolside to tell me 'that they treat all guests fairly and equally regardless of race' standard 'you can't sue us' rhetoric. As this was at the end of the day and the pool was due to close I decided, let it go, move on and have a better day........boy was I wrongThe following day wasn't so bad, food was as grim as the day before with fancy named dishes that the eye translated as 'slop trough', the Tagine was as dry as a camels back side as was the chicken, one bonus, fresh oysters, I took a chance and didn't get ill they were actually very nice and fresh.The day after was where all hell came loose, following a relatively pleasant day, eating the same slop, how does a country like Marakesh who have bountiful quantities of spices and herbs in the market fail to send any of them to the Aqua Mirage, catering team I spent my time in the 'quiet' pool enjoying conversations with my fellow guests, 6pm rolled around and out of the pool we all go, following the lifeguard chaining up the perimeter.As I'm collecting my gear to take back I hear a massive splash and behold two young French girls having a lovely old time in the pool while their mother filmed them, so I figured hey, why not colleect a little evidence myself, then realising how creepy it would look filming young girls, i decided not to hit the record button but to display that I if this was a British family they would have been kicked out without a moment's hesitation.As the mother saw what I was 'doing' she approached me very aggressively and took my phone, which I struggled off of her rescuing my phone, however, saw her fall on her back side, her daughters screamed for security who also came a' runnin' and it was here that the French were given the opportunity to defend themselves and in the red corner, myself with no recourse to a defense. Fortunately some of the English guests who I was conversing with came to my assistance to make up numbers and defend the position of my situation.Following that evening's meal I was then approached by the 'hotel manager' and asked to come with him and a security guard. I was lead into an office and I was asked to give my account of what happened which I did, they then also brought up the incident with the lifeguard the following day and said that 'we are evicting you for your inappropriate and aggressive behaviour' I stated to him that he was displaying 'racial bias' by allowing this to happen without due process and ignoring that the French guest had their part to play in all of this too. Unfortunately for me, the hotel manager got very upset and shouted in my face 'ARE YOU CALLING ME RACIST, I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED' I again stated my position of racial bias, trying hard to explain to him what this was versus overt racism, but I may have just as well been trying to show a labrador a card trick, never the less he continued screaming about his no racist bone in his body bla bla bla......Nevertheless I was evicted from the hotel at 10pm on 19th July 2018 from the Aqua mirage, where I decided to leave the country despite having another 7 days left that had been paid for, my wife and children also decided to follow me home, much to my chagrin and 555 to my credit card, but one thing we know to be.......WE AINT GOING BACK TO AQUA MIRAGEIf there is anything you should take from this review......never go back to the same place twice and there is a strong racial bias from the staff at the aqua mirage, which is different from overt racism"

The positive ends there, however.We arrived fairly late in the evening, and the night staff was neither efficient nor friendly. For a long time they couldn't find our reservation, then sent us to a room only to call us back to the desk saying no, that room was occupied, and they would have to give us another. Before ultimately deciding that it was indeed unoccupied and sending us back to the same room. But the bigger issues were:1 we had specifically bid on a fourstar hotel. This property  as clearly explained by posters on the wall behind their reception desk  apparently has both 3star and 4star rooms available. Even after I showed them the receipt for the 4star reservation, they without apology assigned us a 3star room2 that room was quite cramped and poorly designed, and generally did not represent what most people would consider even a threestar experience3 upon arrival, I was asked if I wanted a double bed or two twins and I indicated that I definitely preferred a double bed. Without explanation or apology we were instead given a room with two awkwardly arranged separated, arranged in an L arrangement twin beds. I had the impression that this may have been related to disapproval toward us for some reason. Just because we had booked the room at a ""good"" price Because we are a samesex couple Because we are an interracial coupleThe property was definitely disappointing, but I suppose poor, not ""terrible"". And the service from the ladies at the front desk the next morning was fine, actually. But the service from the night staff definitely warrants a ""Terrible"" rating for this property. I would recommend you avoid it, and definitely avoid bidding with Priceline for a 4star hotel in this area, until they drop this property as one of their providers."

When I explained to him that I was going to the convention and staying in the hotel he let me pass but was negatively hesitant speaking under his breath. After parking I went in the hotel to the convention after a while I decided to  leave the property to and come back later. As I was approaching the parking ticket stand the same attendant that I was dealing with earlier started yelling at me and accusing me of lying to him. I tried my best to explain to him I would check in later , I was in my vehicle and proceeded to leave and he continued to yell at me so I stopped my vehicle and got out i told the gentelman he is not allowed to speak to me like that, We went on for about 3minutes all the time he was yelling at me i was embarrassed and humiliated I asked to speak to his manager. To my amazement the only thing the manager could do was defend his actions and explain to me that today has been a hectic day and that people have been caught smoking pot and that the same attendant was almost hit by a car  non of which have to do with me. For the manager to explain to me why his employee was irate with me is unprofessional. Being my first time staying at this resort I shouldn't have ever gone through this but because of how I was treated I will never set foot on this property ever again!!!! And I cancelled my reservation I will be writing of my experience on trip advisor and I will be contacting cooperate. I believe I was racially targeted because of my skin complexion and because I have tattoos and no one took it seriously.."

We have been staying here for over 3 nights and whilst walking back into the hotel lifts , I was stopped by a Philippine staff standing by the lift area asking for my room number and name. The people entering in front of me were not even though they looked like they have just walked off the beach into the hotels in their slops.  On catching him out on this behaviour ,  his excuses range from 1. If it is a guy and girl together,  we need to ask room number 2. If they are going to restaurants we don't ask for room numbers 3. We need to ask room numbers from everyone. Pray tell me how did he decipher that the people with slops and suitcases were going to their restaurant We than proceeded to the reception to complaint about this blatant profiling and a middle eastern guy at the reception told us that the lift guy should ideally be asking everyone but he is human after all so he can miss a few people. What a pathetic excuse for a hotel. I think my husband who is white was more offended than I was when the reception guy kept on saying "" please don't be offended, he is only human "". He completely did not understand our issue. In my 100 trips to Dubai ,  I have never once been profiled like this minion at this hotel did and than tried to show us attitude like he is the bees knees. I would strongly suggest you stay away from this hotel if you are a person of colour or in a mixed race relationship. There are much better options available in Dubai So you don't really need some lift man subjecting you to profiling and than his ""boss"" patronising you by telling you not to get offended who by the way ate getting paid by your dollars ."

My trip to the Riu Palace included my fiance, and I. Check In The process was quick. Thanks to Avion for checking us in.Room 639 This room was very spacious. I was not please with the view. Upon, looking directly out of the window not much of a sight, and it was a view of another hotel. You must step out on the balcony, and look to the right you could see a view of the beach. The room up keep was okay.Restaurants Guests had to make dinner reservations for one of the restaurants included with the all inclusive package between 8am11am. We arrived at the hotel Friday afternoon approximately at 3:30pm. That evening our first group predinner reservations was not found in their system.  We had to scramble to find a place to eat Don Pablo. Saturday morning approximately 8am as instucted to make dinner reservations. All restaurants were booked. Thank Goodness for Don Pablo and Natulis buffets this weekend. The Riu can do better with their restaurants accommodations for paying guests. These restaurants had two sitting for 6:30pm or 9pm for all their guests, and there was no way to accommodate their guests. We were very disappointed we was limited to where we could have dinner. Thank you Don Pablo for your breakfast, and dinner.Room services and house keeping was decent. Show/Disco The Saturday night show was nice. The disco was fun once it opened up at 11pm. They played a mixture of music for everyone to enjoy. I danced all night.Beach Attendants In my opinion I have travel to several all inclusive resorts, some attendants are not eager to assist or help black guests. I was on the beach and I needed some assistances with one of the beach chairs to be set up. I asked two attendants to help, they began to conversed back and forth in spanish who would help me. We had a few more racial undertone experiences.We had a few other undertoned racial experiences such as who they preferred in selected areas as well as events. However,  the other 80 of servers were very welcoming.Renova Spa My massage was just okay for me. It was very cold in the room. The oil was not warm at all. They lady was nice, but did not apply any deep tissue techniques. In DR their spa time was excellent. I fell a sleep, and felt wonderful. My fiance enjoyed his massage. The spa appearances was nice, and clean.  Bring your own towels if you get in to the hot tub. Hotel Appearances Visiting my coworker in room 702 the view is beautiful. The lobby is very beautiful.Shopping We left the hotel for a 5 minutes walk to a little shopping area to buys gifts for our sons. It was very reasonable, and a lot of beautiful jewelry ladies to select from. Casino My fiance enjoyed the casino.Near Hotels Some other hotels along the beach were very nice to visit, and to interact with guests from around the world. Some other beach activites were very fun with a small charge. Airport Bus arrived on time to escort our group to the airport. Customs was no problems just follow their instructions. However, due to a problem with Southwest Airlines we were stuck in the airport from approximately 5 hours until the problem was fix. Which was fine. I rather we were all safe then sorry. Southwest did issued us a 100 voucher towards our next trip. We arrived home this morning safely.I rate the RIU Palace of three stars. The most important part is knowing how to have fun, and we made the best of the trip by enjoying each other company. However, I have no desire to visit this hotel again. Enclosed are pictures. 1View from room 639. 2ndView from room 702. 3pool side area. The weather was great."

They did not approach his 3 white friends. I sent a note to corporate expressing my concerns and asked that they train their employees, mistaking this Hyatt with the Hyatt Rosemont located down the street. I immediately heard from the Hyatt Rosemont manager who apologized for the situation, but we quickly realized that the incident actually happened at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare. The Rosemont manager forwarded our communication to the manager of the Hyatt Regency O'Hare. I never received any communication from the O'Hare manager, which leads me to believe that it is not a situation that he is taking seriously. This is a huge concern. I am an event planner/producer, and I will not bring my business to the Hyatt Regency O'Hare. Racial profiling is an extreme violation that needs to be addressed promptly. I do hope they figure out this issue and are able to train their employees to value all guests."

We had stayed there many years ago when it was the AMERICAN INN. This was some years ago and although the Hotel has changed from the American Inn firstly To the Ramada Limited and now the Rodeway. As seasoned travellers we thought this would be a good bet. In the days of the American Inn it was family friendly and couple friendly however now as the Rodeway Inn it was anything but.We checked in and the guy on the reception was fairly friendly but his guidance to finding the elevator was not at all helpful. In fact we could not find it and we were a little jet lagged and ended up hauling our suitcases up the steps at the rear of the hotel.I decided to move the vehicle from the rear of the hotel because a group of youths had gathered, I moved it to the side of the hotel where we could be closer to it. These youths along with some older people had been shouting racial comments at each other. I went down to get some snacks out of the machine but there was hardly anything in the  machine. One good thing came out of my journey for snacks was that I found the elevator which really was around a sharp corner and we had driven right past it upon our haste to get to our room, but again the receptions directions in the first instance were not that accurate.We then proceeded to check the beds for bed bugs and I am happy to report that there were no bed bugs to be found.We decided to settle down and watch some TV. the TV was at least 20 years old and was of the same type when we visited this hotel in the bygone times of the American Inn. The TV signal was not very good at all and the wifi signal kept dropping out. The decor  was very old and the room grubby. The carpet was not clean at all and my wife said they needed to improve the overall hygiene.We were awakened around eleven pm by bad language from the guests on the same floor as ourselves and they were congregating just a few feet outside our window. It looked as if some of them could have been construction workers from the nearby road improvements being conducted nearby. The shouting continued for a while. Then during the night at 3 am there was a row from next door and loud Spanish voices cold be heard, it was obvious that a couple were having some problems. Again people congregated outside. We eventually got to sleep but not before I had barricaded the front door AND this is from someone who travels a lot.Thankfully daylight came and we waited for the nearby guests to leave before venturing down to the free breakfast. I have to say which was not too bad at all.I can tell you there are better hotels in this area and my advice to you is to check in with them. You do not feel safe at this hotel and there does not appear to be any security with regard to this hotel in anyway that would make guests feel protected.Avoid this hotel but if you have to stay here don't take your wife's or kids"

The rooms are nasty and smelled horrible. The only people that were staying there while we were there were carck heads and drunks that too top things off were racist and were yelling racial comments from the balcony about Mexicans when they saw my 2 kids and myself walking to the room thinking we were Mexican. I definately will never stay there again!

There is so much that could be done to spruce this place up. Little things like touch up paint, someone to vacuum air conditioner vents, and even a little furniture polish and dusting are things that are just expected. Apparently, this hotels idea of clean rooms is to change the sheets on the bed and remove items from the refrigerator. I was afraid that they hadn't touched the bathroom. With Greenville, MS's water already being brown it was hard to tell if the toilet was even clean!! This I turned back my covers and a racial obscenity was written on the box spring...it read ""Greenville, MSNrs So Sad!!"" Not to mention the boxspring had Marriott on it...I guess they go to other hotels and savage whatever it is that they throw away. That racial slur was unacceptable and that box spring should have been removed!!!!! I will never stay here again and regardless of the budget you have, you should not choose this place. The location is not worth it!"
Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg42416d655364r229285391CartierMansionBedBreakfastLudingtonMichigan.html,Date of stay: September 2014,Cartier Mansion Bed  Breakfast,United States,Michigan MI,Ludington,gsw2006,"Very Rude Host  Nice Home, Still  Horrible Experience","My husband and I frequent bed and breakfasts, so when friends invited us to Ludington, we decided to try the Cartier Mansion.  There are exactly ZERO bed and breakfasts we've ever given a negative review about.  Could we have rated Cartier's Mansion a zero, we would have.During a telephone conversation prior to arrival, I got a bad feeling about the host, Sue Ann, because as a courtesy, I mentioned to her, ""We are coming from Indiana and we'll be arriving late, so should we just call that evening to let you know""  She reiterated exactly what I'd just said, but in a strangely directive tone that came across as, ""I sure hope you don't put us out!"" She tried to say it gently, but it came across as crass.  Heevyjeevies already.We, indeed, arrived late that Friday night 11:30.  I dreaded calling to let her know because  conversations with her elicited stress.  It's like a bad feeling you can't put your hands on, but you feel it.  Profoundly.  Her speech seems edgy... as though she's giving it everything she can to be warm and pleasant, but it's not natural.  Nor is it possible, it seems.Her spouse Gary, however, seemed entirely different.  He was pleasant.  Warm.  Seemed sincerely hospitable.  My husband and I enjoyed our talks with him.  Gary welcomed us upon arrival.  He reviewed the policies and showed us to our room, the Lighthouse Room.The home itself is nice, if you enjoy old homes that are somber.  What the heck was I thinking when I selected it  This much was indeed my fault.  I knew it was historic.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed learning about the history behind the home, as Gary was kind enough to give us a tour one morning.  But I was quite unimpressed with the smell of the old home, the creaking doors and floors, and the depressing ambiance.  Just a personal taste... I'm sure antique lovers would love it..Far worse than the visual lack of appeal for me was the thick, uncomfortable atmosphere.  There seems to be a heavy, dark negative energy permeating the home, in spite of the faint, melodic spiritual tunes that emanated from the music room.My introduction to Sue Ann was the ""icing on the rotten cake,"" so to speak.Our first morning there, I was tired from the drive and we were meeting friends elsewhere for lunch, so I called Sue Ann in a very timely manner and notified her that I wouldn't be going down to breakfast.  After getting dressed a couple of hours later, my hubby and I were leaving to meet  friends.  I told him, ""I'm going to go and introduce myself to Sue Ann and thank her for the accommodations.""  He and I thought that would be kind and thoughtful.  So my husband joined me.I heard voices behind the kitchen door, where Sue Ann was, so to be polite, I knocked.  She came to the door and bounced out.  Smiling, I said, ""Good morning!  I just wanted to introduce myself before we left.""  Sue Ann's response  With a seemingly fake smile from ear to ear, ""WELL, WHO LET YOU IN  DID YOU GET A CODE FROM SOMEONE""  Being the only African American female in the home my husband is Caucasian, I assumed she didn't realize she had an African American guest, as she hadn't yet met me.  I said, ""I'm Sharen.  We're renting the Lighthouse Room.""She said, ""Ohhhhhh!... and said some other words... but honestly  I didn't hear one word she said after that.  The grand smile she wore seemed as distasteful as her unusually crass and utterly boorish greeting.I was floored.  Nothing was worse than that depressing, creaky home except Sue Ann.  She seems to have no business in the hospitality industry, as far as I can tell... if a BB host is expected to be, in any way hospitable.  And yes, I believe they are.All in all, I don't take much offense to racial matters.  I'm not moved by racial arguments or claims.  I tend to be a cheerful, happygolucky person with a very warm temperament, and I embrace the world with open arms.  And everyone in it.  So, I'm not broken up by the experience, nor do I necessarily see it as a racial slur.  I'm not really sure what it was, except rude beyond belief.  Sue Ann read my comments in her guest book and called to apologize.  She admitted, ""You're right.  It is exactly word for word what I said.  I was curt.  I will give you that.  I was curt.  I'll apologize for that.  But it had nothing to do with your being African American.  Let me tell you.""I accepted her... apology  I guess you could call it that.  But I honestly don't care about the reason she was curt.  I just don't think I or my husband deserved it.  We paid 288.00 for a 2 night stay in a mediocre room with uncomfortable accommodations and a very rude host.  Even the homes policies are written in a crude, unrefined manner.  At the bottom of a list of directive policies which SCREAM, ""Be grateful you're staying here!!"" vs. ""We're happy you've come"", the entire pet policy simply says, ""Your pet will have to find other accommodations.""  In Sue Ann's guest book, I suggested they phrase this in a more gentle manner.  A simple, ""No pets, please"" would typically suffice.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone... not even one's pet.  There's far too much stress involved with a stay at Cartier's.  Sue Ann's overwhelming presence, illmannered temperament and negative energy weighs too heavily in setting the tone for a guest's entire experience.  Every other BB we've ever stayed at felt like a peaceful haven we retreated to in the midst of our explorations.  BBs when done well tend to fade into the background of a vacation, lending support, amenities, peace and comfort to passersthrough.  This one doesn't.  It's dominating.  Costly.  And really, not worth the trouble.Hubby and I typically hate to see our BB stays come to an end, but we actually celebrated our departure from this dark little heavy place.  Seriously, couldn't wait to leave."

The hotel management should invest in sensitivity training for Vincent at the Front Desk.From the moment I walked in, Vincent, who was at the front desk, refused to acknowledge my existence and would not speak to me with the respect and courtesy that ALL human beings deserve. Vincent did not greet me with the customary: ""Welcome to the Chelsea Inn."" Instead, he refused to look me in the eye, his responses were terse, rude and abrupt. When I approached the front desk, Vincent was beyond rude, in fact his behavior was repugnant. He refused to make eye contact with me at any give moment; he merely mumbled that I would be in room 90, which was downstairs. He did not offer to find anyone to assist me with my suitcase down the narrow and steep staircase to the BASEMENT. Fernando, one of the hotel workers was kind enough to assist me when he saw me struggling with my bags; and for that I am very grateful to him. The room, which was located next to a loud and noisy staff room or club, was smaller than my bedroom at home. It was also dark and dank. It seemed that no effort was made to make the room appear welcoming, never mind beautiful. The towels I received were soiled, ripped and frayed, there was no washcloth, and the floor was dirty. I honestly think this room is used as a staff sleeping room between shifts. It was small, dirty, and noisy. After stepping out for a quick bite with one of my friends, I returned to the Inn with the notion of requesting a room change. When I approached Vincent a second time, he remained true to form and refused to look me in the eye, which is what common courtesy and the Hospitality Industry require. I approached him with kindness and the courtesy which he refused to give me, and asked if we could talk for a moment. He said yes, but continued to play with his computer. I asked him if I could change rooms because I am a light sleeper and my room is next to a very loud staff room or club. Vincent, without missing a beat and without removing his eyes from his everimportant computer screen said: ""Your room was assigned before you came."" I then replied: ""That is not what I asked. I want to know if there are any empty rooms because I cannot stay in this  room because it is too noisy."" Vincent made no effort to make my stay comfortable in the dark, dank and dirty basement room. He only insisted that my room was assigned before they arrived and saw that I am an African American woman. The most interesting fact about our conversation is that I never once asked if the rooms were assigned before arrival, but Vincent's guilty conscience spoke for itself when he continued to reiterate that feeble point. I checked in at 5:30 p.m.,and checked out at midnight. I did not care one iota about ""losing my money."" There are more important things than money in this current climate of racial discrimination and intolerance, such as treating human beings with kindness, courtesy, compassion and respect. If these qualities are important for you when staying at hotel or inn, then RUN and I mean RUN away from the Chelsea Inn."

Worst and Horrible experience with racial profiling. Plz AVOID this place if u speak Chinese although they advertised as multi languages friendly. First of all, one of the receptionists with a short ponytail didnt qsk her name since I was furious second day before we left on finding out that actually she spoke Chinese well who led us to our room pretended she only spoke Japanese and somewhat English. So she could avoiding talking to us in the beginning no greeting at all as well which gave us almost no info about their hotel, room or even the type of their hot springs  I flied 20hrs solely for this. Secondly, before making the reservation of private hot spring shortly after we arrived before the dinner I ASKED her if this is private hot spring is for free in English and she told me yes. However, got charged for 2000yen second day when we checked out. For us, I understand the rule and respect the rules of your hotel but she shouldn't lie to us about the extra charge. This was ended up a scam. Third, after she realized that we have possibly found out that she does speak Chinese. She passed by us she confronted us with a face but without a single word as we left the hotel. Last, they gave us ONE small bath onsen which only suited for 1 person althought they charged us for 2 persons. A friend of mine told me that they could offer us onsen with 2 baths instead. This was horrifically racial profiling.... The only good memory of this hotel is the lady who served us at dinner and breakfast. Informative and friendly.  Food was okay. Room was not match to the description when I am booked."

The confirmation of payment was done days later after a followup.Check in was smooth.Room allotted had a electrical problem in the bathroom for hot water. This was resolved after I called up.The next day I needed water to take meds but apparently their stock of water would arrive much later and they didn't have a single bottle of mineral water.While checking out too the process was slow and tedious, despite doing a 50 advance payment , I had to remind them about the same while settling the bill.The breakfast buffet was the only positive with a decent spread of fruits, south and North Indian food optionsWhat I found  disgusting was the racial discrimination towards Indian tourists which is very apparent not just here but in many places. There's an AC bus for foreign tourists and when I asked the reception staff about the bus, the way he said it's for foreigners and Indians shouldn't use it ; gave me the first hand experience of racial discrimination.Sadly in our own country people treat fellow countrymen so badly.The location of the hotel is close to the clock tower area, about 15 min walk.Not happy with my stay here."

Even the officers said it was a racial thing.  We booked for 4 people for one week and left the second day.  It was Thanksgiving week and also my daughters birthday.

On arrival, we offered the credit card and the ID but one of the employees insisted that we first bring the letter from Wyndham's Welcome center otherwise we can't check in.  After some discussion, this individual singlehandedly decided that we will not be allowed to stay at the hotel. At our request, she called the offsite manager who defended her employee's decision and threatened us that if we did not leave, they will call the police. I wish I had let them take the next step but we were too terrified. What is it if not racial bias because we look different being from another country and culture. When I contacted Wyndham, they did not want to do anything about the misconduct and they cited that they do not own, operate, manage, control or occupy this facility. The Manager, of course, refused to do anything either even no apologies for what happened and how we felt threatened, discriminated, and nowhere to go at that moment.  Nobody wants to answer the question that if a customer has an advance reservation, shared a credit card to pay for the room, and has a valid ID, how and why s/he can be denied a room in the hotel. The manager of the facility or the corporate has no answer. That is why it appears to be a case of racial bias in 2018. I wish I could offer compliments on the facility and food but the management never let us have that opportunity. Sad but true and so I decided to share with fellow travelers."

We wanted somewhere quiet and we got what we wanted,Kyprianos and family were very helpful, friendly. Nothing was to much trouble for them .It was very clean, pool was lovely and warm. Sometimes we was the only family at the pool. I have looked at other reviews left by another holiday maker who was there at the same time as us and I am disgusted at the racial comments a adult has put in with regards to the British kids and them urinating in the pool !!!!.If these people choose to stay in bed till lunch time and then complain they can not obtain a sun lounger then im afraid to say it's tough ...If you have a problem intergreating with British and other nationalities please stay at home and keep your racial and unfair comments regarding British children and the owners of kyprianos to your self .Some people are to hard to please!!This was a beautiful friendly place to stay and will be going back. I have already recommended this accomatation to my friends and family . Thank you kyprianos "

There was some speedbumps getting a INTO a room because Trip Advisor agoda compensated us about 40 for the racial mishap and the card provided did not have enough funds. Aside from that she was very efficient in regards to helping us. I do not remember her name but she was working Dec 31st 78 pm."

My pregnant wife and I, being racial minorities, felt like we were not welcome in a few incidents.  The checkin experience and an encounter with a security guard left us frustrated. We had high expectations from the reviews and recommendations of others and were shocked by some interactions with staff. This was not expected from a wellknown and fine establishment such as yourselves.We arrived for checkin around 3:30pm and walked up to Sylvia, who was focused on her computer. She did not look up, greet or acknowledge us as we sat there waiting for about 20 sec. Then Geri called us over to checkin. She lacked warmth in her greeting and told us that our room was not yet ready which we expected. Geri told us she would call us when it was ready. While we were with Geri, we noticed an older white couple walked into the lobby to checkin and Sylvia welcomed them with a friendly attitude before they were at her desk. We waited at the Loch Ness Pool until 4pm and walked back to the lobby. Geri told us it was still not ready. When we asked about the checkin time policy, she said that it was only a couple minutes after 4 and that there was a large group of people checking out, hence the delay. That is understandable, but she was not even apologetic about it, as if to say, ""That's too bad."" Again, she told us she would call us when the room was ready. We sat in the lobby for about 10 to 15 min. before Sylvia walked over to us and told us that we were being switched into another room. This was appreciated, but why wasn't this done sooner if you all knew that there would be a delay with checkinI already addressed my concerns about Sylvia and Geri above. Before my wife and I left the property, we decided to sit at the Copperhead pool to read. Nobody else was at the pool at the time. A few minutes after sitting down, a security guard drove up to the pool and told us that someone called about the gates being locked to the pool area. He asked us how we got in and we told him we came through the gate and it was not locked of all the times that we were at the pool, we have not had any issues with the gates being locked. After he checked one of the gates and repeating that someone called about the gates being locked, he said, ""While I'm here, do you have a guest pass"" Fortunately, I had it with me, but since when did we have to have a guest pass to access the Copperhead pool None of the other guests that we had seen during our stay had to display a guest pass, nor was there anyone checking. He looked at my pass, tried to make small talk, and then left. We were surprised about the encounter and the fact that he did not check any other gates to see if they were locked."

The room was clean, the food at the Market was tasty, the Tram drivers and bellmen were polite and friendly.Toward the end of my 4 day/3 night visit I encountered what I believe was racial profiling while relaxing by the Peacock Pool alone on Tuesday, April 17th around 5 pm.  I was approached by security and asked for a pass for the pool.  I didn't have my guest pass so I showed my room key.  The comment used by Jacob, the Securitas security guard, was ""since you cooperated, I will let you slide this time.""  I didn't quite understand what he was implying, but I felt that the comment was racially motivated and I was greatly offended.  After my experience with security, I was no longer interested in using any other facilities.  I just wanted to go home.  This experience has impacted my views about Salamander and iPrefer resorts.  I do not plan to stay at any resort associated with this brand.  I am also not pleased with the way Ron, Director of Operations, handled the situation.  He was very insensitive to my complaint and feelings about what happened.  I do, however, appreciate the way J. Michael Williams, General Manager, handled the situation.  He seemed more sensitive to what I experienced and more willing to try to accommodate me for the last night of my stay.On a positive note, Noeme Lott of housekeeping was very polite and pleasant.  She did a great job with the room.  Also, Andrea of the Market Grille was an excellent waitress and very polite and attentive.  Other pleasant experiences were with the Tram drivers and bellmen."

I can sleep in hard beds and won't mind old rooms just as long I am treated well. I also try to be patient with hotels when I travel because I know it's tough to maintain a business. However, I am writing this review to help travelers make an informed decision and 'alert' the owner of this hotel to consider a performance assessment and attitude check of the hotel's staff particularly the male manager.We had been treated like secondclass citizens by its male staff we suppose he is the manager/supervisor. It all started with their credit card machine. Apparently, they do not allow  the use of the machine's swiping mechanism and only allow the use of the mechanism for micro chips. This information was not mentioned when I called them up by the way, they also do not answer emailsI confirmed our booking only because I made an international callthey did not answer any of my 3 emails.Therefore, upon arrival about 5 pm, we were not able to make the payment for the 1st day of our stay we booked for 2 nights, using our credit card because of this 'weird' thing about not using the swiping mechanism. As we were running out of RM already, we said we will change our money in the evening and make the payment later on. We had available local currency so we temporarily used it to serve as 'security payment' for the room key subject to the agreement that we will replace the local currency with RM as soon as we had made a forex transaction again that evening. The lady staff graciously accepted our money in local currency. We were thankful.We went out and had dinner with friends and, unfortunately, didn't come across any forex shop nearby. We then went back to the hotel thinking that we can postpone the payment in the morning or if they will insist, pay with our money first local currency and we will just replace the money with RM first thing in the morning. All we needed was to have a good night's sleep as we had been in the middle of a road trip around Malaysia.Just a few minutes after entering our room, a staff knocked on our door demanding payment. We told him we did not see any forex shop nearby and asked him if he can accept the exact equivalent of a day's stay in our local currency. He agreed so I asked my husband to settle it at the reception area.Lo and behold, after about 20 minutes, my husband returned saying that their manager arrived and did not allow us to temporarily use our local currency first !. He said was talking to him arrogantly when I went down, I noticed he talked to me that way, too, demanding payment in RM. I went down with my husband and explained to the manager that it was not our problem that they wouldn't allow us to swipe our credit card. Apparently, my husband told me later on that they no longer allow the use of the swiping mechanism because they had been duped before. It's like now, because of that incident, they consider all guests as possible scam artists who will dupe them again. We explained to them that in fact, they accepted our money for the key deposit so why not accept the same money for a day's stay and it was just for the night anyway and swore to find a forex around town, even if we wake up earlier than usual. We appealed but the manager will not listen to any pleading. According to my husband also, the manager demanded to hold BOTH our passports as ""security"" in case we don't want to find RM that evening! Hold BOTH our passports as if we are fugitives! This was turning out to be something that you only see in the movies in a previous era where there was still too much racial discrimination...To make the long story short, my husband and I went out, at about 11:30 pm, in the dead of a very COLD evening, tired, just to look for an ATM machine. Fortunately, there was a branch of a global bank nearby. Can you imagine if we're not depositors in an international bank What if there are only local ATMs there with no global connectivity What if the ATM malfunctioned Will the hotel push us out in the middle of a cold night The hotel manager made us feel that way. He made us feel that our currency is useless, that we are not trustworthy, that we are trying to dupe them. I also thought, in retrospect, will he treat a whiteskinned guest with such arrogance and insensitivity It may sound illogical but such things happen even in the country where I come from. I have seen how local staff tend to prioritize whiteskinned guests in hotel lobbies or reception areas. But that's probably beside the point. Racial discrimination aside, the hotel owner should thoroughly talk with his manager and educate him about manners, about respect, about valuing customers, about the unfairness of treating all guests as possible scammers. If they were worried about guests not paying up, they can improve their credit card policy, or adequately make announcements that ""swiping"" is NOT allowed, especially during the prebooking process. And they should answer emails !.More importantly, they can charge it experience that they have been duped before but they have no right to regard their future guests as possible scammers. A dishonest person will always meet his bad karma. Let the universe teach him a lesson. But for someone to treat people/guests as possible cheaters or criminals just because of a single bad incident is really unfair. This manager should not be in the hotel business unless he learns to be more professional, respectful, and kinder. Any business thrives on good client relationship and customer management. You treat your guests like this and you are causing your eventual downfall.The name ""bird's nest"" reminds us of home, of a nesting place, of a refuge. Sadly, this establishment does not deserve this name as long as it employs a very uncaring manager/staff. Even birds will feel insulted.As for the physical features of the place: They have no elevators and the hotel is on road that climbs up so this means that even climbing up to the lobby and reception takes a lot of effort.  Bed quality  poor Room  below average at least the room assigned to usBathroom  terrible sink was leaking so the bathroom floor is always wet. There is also no partition between the wet and dry areas of the bathroom so this was somewhat an issue because Cameron Highlands is a cold place and that means stepping on wet floors all the time in the middle of a very cold eveningOverall comment: You may want to avoid this place. There are other better places in this price range."

Our cars were parked in rv spots we weren't aware and instead of just letting us know that they were rv spots she told us very rudely that we needed to move them to the parking spots by the office and pay 5 which we had no problem doing. Then she goes on about how we had to many people there and that we needed to leave..again very rudely !! We overlooked her attitude with us and tried to find other alternatives like maybe renting another space or cabin for the night or something and she said no ! So we ended up talking to the manager and she said it was okay to rent another space etc.. so then I go to get some stuff from my car and take the kids to the swimming pool and she approaches me and tells me I cant park there AFTER SHE TOLD ME TO PARK THERE! . She was just giving me the hardest time .. so after exchanging a few words I tell her okag I'm gonna walk over to my friend and see what we can do about this. .She tells me to take my car!!  .. It's like 1 minute away walking ..so you want me to load all 3 kids up just to drive 10 seconds away ! I just didn't understand why she was being so rude so i told her she was being very rude ..its not what you say it's how you say it !! So she follows me to the trailer where everyone was and starts tripping again so finally everyone was just like is this a racial thing and this crazy lady said ""Yes! It's a racial thing"" and drives off !!! I couldn't believe it !! And then my friend was fed up and asked for a refund and she said no refunds !! There was just no winning with her !! I just left !! Just horrible !!"

I dont think the people who run it understand that the people who check in there are PAYING THEIR SALARIES and keeping their crappy hotel functioning and should therefore be treated with much more respect. I checked in at around 10pm and my daughter and her friend were coming up to hang out for a little while. I had to run to the store and left them in there and when I came back, they were in the hallway with the manager and security who had accused me of trying to sneak unregistered guests into my room, and a security guard who was clearly racial profilng accusing my daugther black of being a prostitute, most likely because her friend was a white male. They told me there are no guests after 9pm, though there was nothing about this rule posted at the desk or in any paperwork that I signed, so they accused me of breaking a rule that I was never informed about in the first place. Upset that I couldnt have my daughter over for a little while keep in mind I am visitng from Massachusetts, I wanted to leave and get my money back because I cannot fathom staying at a motel that doesn't allow you to have guests, and the manager refused saying the room had been used which it really hadnt. I hadnt been in there for more than 45 minutes and hadnt disturbed anything, and threatened to call the police because my daughter and her friend were clearly upset about not being able to come up after driving up so far to see me while I was in town, as if his solution to angry guest being upset with poor customer service policies and practices is to just call the police. He also threatened to charge me a 50 cleaning deposit if my daughter and friend didnt calm down, which is extremely unprofessional to resort to threatening to taking my money instead of working toward a resolution. Interestingly enough, while they were so busy scrutinizing us as if we were up to something sketchy Im an ordained minister so go figure...all of these weird tweaker looking people were roaming the hallways freely without being questioned at all. And its not as if this is the Taj Mahal. My room itself wasnt bad, but the place in general is dirty and full of negative energy and weird looking people. I checked out as soon as I woke up because I only stayed so as not to lose any money. I have been really outraged by the racial profiling that I have endured in California since I have been here, but this one was completely ridiculous!! I am not encouraging anyone to stay here or not. That is entirely up to you, but all of the one star reviews of this place says SO MUCH about what you""re dealing with at this place."
Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg41131d93677r508855528ResidenceInnbyMarriottColumbiaEllicottCityMaryland.html,Date of stay: July 2017,Residence Inn by Marriott Columbia,United States,Maryland MD,Ellicott City,"Salt Lake City, Utah","Would have been 5 Stars, but......","So here's the deal with this place. It was Fantastic for the most part. They had eat and mingle nights for families Monday thru Wednesday and that was awesome. The staff was super friendly and great people. The room was decent, not luxurious but ok. They had a great breakfast, laundry facilities, pool, and exercise room. So here's the down part. They didn't ever really cleaned the room. If there was even a pillow of ours or one backpack on the bed they wouldn't straighten out the bed at all. The biggest thing that made this place a 3 star instead of a 5 star was that one of the staff had kids there or some kinds of another family member, which isn't a problem at all. It's great if someone can bring kids to work, as a working mom I'm all for that. But one of the youth one night had his friends over at 9:30 pm at night and our family went to use the pool while they were there, which also isn't a problem. But they were a group of older teenage boys of maybe 8 total, who were yelling diving and splashing all over the pool. I don't mean just normal splashing like crazy stuff. They were cursing and using profane and offensive racial language so we could purposefully hear them, the whole hotel probably heard them. One of the young men said that they should calm down since others were at the pool too and it was late and the other boys got all worked up about how we addressing my family didn't own the pool and just cause we were white didn't mean that we could tell them what to do, Um, we literally didn't even say anything at ALL. They then started saying things like ""the south will rise again"" and other racial things that I don't feel is appropriate to write here. They started saying passiveagressively that we were being racist to them, which we weren't even doing anything, like talking even to each other because they were so out of control and loud. This was not a situation that had anything to do with race it had to do with a group of young men who have some kind of issue with people of different skin colors and think that it's everyone else, they were rude, had bad manners, were verbally and physically aggressive and had no supervision at all. And, we felt like we couldn't even say anything because we knew from talking with other employees and hearing one of the young men talk about his parent that was working there and seeing and hearing the parent address and instruct the boy several times throughout our stay that his parent would be the one at the desk we would have to complain to. We had several other situations that were weird with other guests at the pool too, but that could be the part of the town this hotel is in and that fellow guests are unpredictable. So, would I stay here again Honestly probably not. Not if staff have their kids there and aren't supervising them or are allowing them to bring unruly and dangerous friends that threaten the peaceful stay of paying guest."

Main Street, Wytheville, VA 24382, on June 10, 2017.  We checked in around 7pm.  After only being at your hotel for about an 90 minutes, my wife and children were the victim of racial slurs by another guest in the parking of your hotel.  I reported the incident to the front desk attendent.  She contacted the general manager, James Payne, who instructed her to call the police.  The police arrived and took my wife's statement.  The perpetrator of the racial slurs had since left the parking lot, but was still checked into the hotel.  For the safety of our family, my wife and I decided to find another hotel closer to our final destination.  The police officers agreed.  However, when I asked for an obvious refund for the night, the general manager, James Payne, refused to grant us one.  He informed the front desk attendent via phone that we had already been in the room, and since there was no housekeeper on staff that night, he would be unable to rebook the room to someone else.  This made an already emotional situation even worse.  We understand that the hotel is not responsible for the actions of their guests, but the lack of empathy, inaction, and poor business practices of the general manager is unacceptable."

The cottage is open, friendly and quirky, with its safari animal styled rooms and decorations with dressing gowns to match. Impangele stands at the end of a quiet street overlooking the rolling mountains and the town of Swellendam.On arrival the first thing that one notices is the sign on the door, 'Welcome, ring the bell, if no response, knock, if no response, call or shout' or something along those lines. What a wonderful welcome. It feels like home before you have even entered the door.Swellendam is an old town and at a glance might seem stuck in the geographical divides that South Africa's old racist Government created for it. Amanda and Dave, originally from a small rural town in England, work very hard to erase those racial divides and allow for integrated experiences. Dave is a musician by heart and runs rehearsal with an incredibly talented group of black, white and coloured individuals of all ages and genders. Rappers and poets and singers fill the rehearsal room where Dave rocks on his guitar. Amanda is best friends with Elsabe, owner and house mother at Adalia House, a place of safety for orphans and babies in the process of adoption. Many new parents come to stay at Impangele while visiting their babiestobe at Adaliah House. Impangele has big, spacious rooms, filled with light. The cottage style home has high ceilings and beautiful wooden floors. The bathrooms are neat, clean and intricately designed to fit eat animal styled room. On the back of the doors, one might find a Zebra, Leopard or Giraffe costume to slip into after showers or before breakfast. So much fun to be had."

The rooms are not top notch nor super sanitary but still charming with Maharajalike interior decor The hotel has a lovely courtyard and garden square where peacocks would walk in the mornings during breakfast.I was already liking the place until dinner time on the second last day. We sat down to dinner in the small hotel restaurant with a group of friends. We decided to get drinks from the bar located in the adjacent room. The first batch of people from our table came backs with free drinks because there was a sort of ladies night deal and we could get drinks for free. The  next batch of people on our table also obtained free drinks and soon I felt that I wanted to get something as well. I walked up to the bar and when I got there, there was an extremely rude and outrightly racist at the bartender who told me I could not be served with a drink. I politely inquired why the rest of my party had gotten free drinks but I could not. He replied in barely audible, terrible English something I could barely understand and asked me where I was sitting. Imagine the shock ad embarrassment of having to walk with the bar tender to show him my table just to prove that I was actually a guest at the hotel!! He muttered an okay but just went back to the adjustment bar room. Suffices to say that I did not get a drink and when I went got back to the table, a perfectly fine night been ruined because the conversation changed to  racial microaggression. More importantly, no one bothered to apologize to me. While India is certainly not known for its fair treatment of blackskinned people, as a paying tourist, you'd think you'd be getting your money's worth. I traveled across India during this time and had BEYOND amazing experiences at other hotels across the country The Hilton Garden Inn in Delhi, Aloha on the Ganges, and others. This particular hotel was the ONLY one where I was treated differently from the rest of the rest of the group I was travelling with  who were mostly white or Asian. Friends, family and colleagues suggested pursuing legal action against the hotel for racial discrimination but given the short duration of the stay and the complexity of navigating the Indian legal system as a foreigner, it deemed somewhat impractical. This by far ranks as the worst travelling  I've had not just in India but globally."

We asked them to place our luggage in luggage store they refused they kept it in the lobby next to bellman desk which is unsafe for us. Upon process of check in three different agents had to switch in order to check us in . One came he got our passport then he left us and send us someone else to print the registrations he just asked us to sign he is front desk supervisor when I asked him about the room rates for each room his answer was unprofessional you booked you should know what the rate is. Am wondering if this is how they train their guests . When I saw his reaction I insisted to get the rates he was frustrated. He didnt give any information about hotel facilities nothing. Just got the keys at 1:00 pm and left to our room . When we entered the rooms it was another story the floor dirty the bathroom floor full of dirt and hair. The chair stained with big spots of coffee the walls full of spots and,stains it was so disgusying.

What a bad customer service. I will not recommed this hotel at all . Definetly behind this racial and bad service there is a bad managment. Its obvious the treatment between foreigners non arab and arab guests. Even when I asked one of the team he mentioned suunce we started to have arab guests we forget about standard . Too bad "

And to some extent it did most of these things. The Confederate House is in a lovely part of the Historic district of Savannah, and while it is some distance from the hustle and bustle of shops, cafes and restaurants, the walk to them every day either through the park across the road or along the beautiful old buildinglined streets was great. We felt quite safe walking in the evening and there were lots of joggers/walkers and families about. The building itself is quite a site to behold, both inside and out, and while there is a bit of a tiredness to the place, it sounds as if repairs to water damage to the building from the recent hurricane will help provide a needed refresh.  On the ""unique and charming BB experience front"" it certainly was a unique experience, and one that added to our appreciation of the complex dynamics of social/racial tensions in the U.S. I'm not sure that this should be the case, but like other reviews below, the host was surprisingly outspoken in sharing her conservative political and racerelated opinions.  The experiences that have led the host to hold these views are obviously different to our own, and I guess to some extent, we respect that, but I think by expressing her views so openly runs the risk of making guests feel very uncomfortable and potentially inciting feedback on forums that is not helpful to a commercial operation. We also found our experience of The Confederate House to be unique in other ways, including our welcome and introduction. On entry, we were shown to our seats in the enormous grand hall by Colleen and where the facilities and rules of the house were explained to us.  We found the very detailed verbal virtual tour of our room upstairs as we sat in the downstairs hall to be somewhat odd  and would suggest to Colleen that she instead develop a simple one page of basicinformation rules around keyuse, wifi details etc that can be handed to guests on arrival  allowing her an opportunity to simply chat and welcome guests, without having to get into the nitty gritty details of our room. While I'm sure the intentions behind the sitdown welcome are all good, it seemed strange for things like buttons on our remote and black TV boxes that should never be touched to be explained to us verbally at this point. In all, in terms of facilities we feel like we got what we paid for.  In some ways, as visitors to the U.S. and as educated and curious travellers, the hosts input to the morning conversations at breakfast and our subsequent debrief discussions with other guests following were insightful and added to our own understanding of US society at a pivotal time in the country's history."
Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg60814d595729r433405076TheConfederateHouseSavannahGeorgia.html,Date of stay: October 2016,The Confederate House,United States,Georgia GA,Georgia Coast,"Racine, Wisconsin",Caution: Bates Motel Experience,"The Confederate House is nothing more than a place to sleep and shower; that is, if you dare. My husband and I planned a trip to the south, including 3 nights in Beaufort,SC, and 4 nights in Savannah, GA, at The Confederate House. Following our 3 night stay at a true southern BB, we arrived here at about 2:25 pm and called the owner/operator, as instructed. She informed us that she doesn't check guests in until 3:00, so perhaps we would like to go sit in the park across the street. Proceeding to the park, through the yard, was daunting. The yard is a mess of crumbled brick, concrete and mulch. The exterior of the home is filthy. Once inside, we were told exactly where to leave our bags and which two chairs we could be seated in while she went through the checkin process. The interior of the home is dirty, as well, and has a distinct, musty odor. The first thing out of Colleen's mouth was a political statement I did not agree with. A business owner should be more tactful when addressing guests she doesn't know. She informed us what time breakfast is served and other matters of business, including a warning not to touch the buttons on the t.v. and NEVER to touch the Comcast box dangling from the t.v. because, if something were to go awry with the cable/satellite, it would cost her 100, which would be charged to our credit card. We also heard odd stories about her son and her ailing health. During checkin, she received a phone call from her insurance company and told us she had to take it, leaving us alone in the 2 chairs she ordered us to sit in for about 10 minutes before dismissing us, telling us we were done. Upon going upstairs, we found the room to be okay on first glance; however, the comforter and the floors seemed to have debris on them, and the bathroom had, perhaps, been given a quick onceover, leaving hairs, dust and toothpaste spatter behind from previous guests. Don't expect spa soaps or even facial tissues. Colleen provides large bottles of Suave body washes, shampoo and conditioner for her guests to share. Thankfully, I always pack my own toiletries. My husband and I were so put off by the first impression of the house and the proprietor, we immediately wanted to leave. My husband began searching the internet for other places to stay; however, in the end, we stuck it out because Colleen does not give refunds of any kind. We were not at all comfortable here and spent as little time as possible in the house. I never ate a single breakfast here, but my husband did not have any kudos to give Colleen on her cooking ability. In fact, one morning after breakfast, he was very upset about the conversation at the breakfast table. A couple from Australia had asked Colleen about racial dynamics in the U.S. He told me about how Colleen proceeded on a tirade, the specifics of which I will not repeat here; however, be assured, the remarks were shameful and inappropriate, particularly in the presence of guests. The kindest thing I can think of to say about Colleen is that she did make an attempt to say good morning each day. Please do not spoil your stay in beautiful Savannah by choosing to stay here. If you are on a tight budget, stay at the Quality Inn, instead. The Bates Motel is more welcoming."

On Thursday April 26, 2018 approximately 1:30 am I was racially profiled by one of the security officers.  A group of us had just returned back to the hotel from dinner.  Several of the people from our group stayed outside talking. I jumped out of the UBER and proceeded to enter the hotel thru the revolving doors. A white couple was a couple of steps in front of me.  They entered the hotel and the security guard greeted them with hello madame, hello  monsieur.  The white couple responded by saying hello.  As I walked the security guard told me he needed to see my identification and insisted that I show it to him.  I responded in by telling him no I was going to use the restroom and to leave me alone.  He followed me to the restroom.  As he followed me he kept asking for my identification and I told him no.  After, using the restroom I proceeded to walk thru the lobby and once again as I left thru the revolving door another white couple entered the door as I was making my exit.  I chose to stay in the revolving door and sure enough the guard greeted the white couple with pleasantries.  He did not ask for any identification as well he did not follow them.  I proceeded to walk towards him and asked for his name and badge information I also used a couple of expletives because all of a sudden he could not speak English.  I asked him why he did not ask for identification from the white guest.  He did not answer.  I did manage to take a picture of him. The first manager  that I spoke to was David .  He swore to me that it was not racially profiling.  At this point my anger was heightened.  I advised him that as a white man he has no idea what being racially profiled is like because he never will experience it in his world.  The next person that came out of the office was Mylenepanda .  She came out to deescalate the situation because she is a black woman.  She proceeded to speak to me and then she tried to speak to the security officer.  The security officer did not respond to any of her questions.  Finally, Jennifer  came out and was trying to diffuse the situation. Jennifer, kept insisting it was not a racially motivated incident.  I asked Jennifer if we could watch the video tape so she and everyone else could see what occurred.  She told me that the only way that could happen was if I placed a police report.  I asked to speak to the General Manager of the hotel on several occasions.  I was told he could not be reached because he was on holiday.  He did send me an email on Tuesday April 30, 2018 once I was back in the states. Mr. , your team has failed! Not one person has taking accountability for the racial profiling that occurred to me at the Hyatt Regency Etoile.I gave you a very descriptive account of what occurred.  The incident has been documented several times.  The hotel has the security tape, unless they deleted it from the files, which it should have not been.  Your customer relations took a report and the call was recorded.  Lastly, you received a detailed email from me. Mr.  failed; he apologized for the breakdown in communication.  He never acknowledged the racial profiling occurred.  Mr.  stated,"" We also take very serious any situations where our guests do not feel respected and treated fairly."" Let me be clear with you, it is not a feeling of being disrespected and it is not a feeling of being treated unfairly!  It is a fact that I was disrespected and it is a fact that I was not treated fairly! You have the documentation.   I hold you accountable as the CEO of the Hyatt Regency.  It is your responsibility to take ownership of the epic fails.  Everyone in your organization had an opportunity to correct this and make it better.  I want you to take responsibility for the actions of the employees that represent your company."

We left our luggage and headed out to some local attractions. We arrived back at the hotel at 9:45 pm to checkin. We waited in line for over an hour to checkin. They only had one receptionist and she kept getting interrupted by guests who didn't have toiletries in their room, didn't have towels in their rooms, didn't have coffee in their rooms, beds were not available and room cards were not properly programmed. I don't blame the receptionist as she was trying to get through the line as fast as she could but management should have scheduled another receptionist as we were there one night before Christmas eve and they should have expected a holiday rush. While waiting in line we also experienced a very hostile guest that was spewing racial slurs at another guest. He continued to get louder and nobody did anything. The receptionist was so busy I don't know that she heard him but again management should have several staff at night. I have never been to any hotel where it takes over an hour to get a room. I will not be staying at this hotel again."

Firstly, sent an email to the hotel a week before my arrival, unfortunately this was not responded to, I even tweeted the hotel which they did not respond to. This made a bad initial impression, most so called five star hotels respond to most if not all email communication from guests who have upcoming stays. As a result of this poor initial impression, I wasnt expecting much from my stay. I was checked in by a young woman named Samantha who I admit was very nice and welcoming, Pedro bought my bags up, he was also very nice and managed to have a conversation in Portuguese with him even though my Portuguese is not great.The breakfast service was poor, so, staff were not attentive at all and actually appeared to ignore customers, I am a black male in my early 30s and sad to say this may have had an influence in the attentiveness and attitude of staff. When walking in, I was not welcomed or acknowledged at all, 3 members staff were having a chat amongst themselves at a mini reception leading in to the breakfast area and continued to chat amongst themselves, I proceeded to find my own seat then get up to go and get some cereal, when asking for warm milk, also asked for a cup of tea, the person handling the milk station had to ask a waiter to bring the tea to where I was sat. Anyway, when I am having my breakfast, I notice  2 young white woman walk up the breakfast area, staff acknowledge and welcome them and one proceeds to escort them to a seat, I notice this occur again when an older white male turns up. I am little disappointed by this and am left to question why the apparent difference in treatment When, deciding on hotels to stay in capetown, I was aware that racial undertones still existed in South Africa and had led me to reject a few other 5star hotels based upon trip advisor reviews which had indicated undertones of racial biases. Unfortunately, I wasnt expecting this from the westin, given that most reviews I read hadnt pointed out such issues.Staff cleaning the room are not as effective, I went out twice in the morning  from 10 to 11am then again 11:30am to 2pm each time staff cleaning the rooms saw me go out, as I was going back to the room at 2pm staff cleaning the rooms ask me if I want the room cleaned, of course, I do, they tell me they are about to finish and the staff who do turndown service can clean the room after 4pm. I wanted the room cleaned and had room service from the night before which I wanted taken out. I opt to go up to the gym whilst the room is cleaned. Again I am not impressed, I know staff are busy cleaning the rooms but surely 2pm is very late to get a room serviced which still has occupancy, I would have expected the room cleaned much earlier especially when I was out let alone having to be asked to wait till 4pm for turndown service to clean the room.Another gripe is that my room was prepaid before arrival, I was asked to leave an amount for incidentals which I opted not to and was told that room service etc would have to be paid on the spot which I was fine with. Most hotels take a deposit which I was expecting but this hotel did not take one. Anyway, I have room service the previous night but the waiter didnt bring the credit card machine and didnt even ask for a payment then, I signed for the room service and expected to settle up the bill when I checked out. Again, I order room service for lunch, same situation occurs, waiter didnt ask for payment just asked for me to sign for the service, again I expected to settle up at checkout. 2 hrs after my lunch I get a phone call from reception saying a payment wasnt taken for room service the previous night and they would need to take the payment today and would be coming to my room with a credit card machine, I was expecting to settle this at checkout like most other places but no problem in settling the bill then, I I tell her about my lunch as well and also tell her to ensure that the waiters bring a credit card machine next time I order room service. Less than 2 minutes after this call, I get the waiter who brought my lunch 2 hours earlier on the phone saying they need to take payment for the lunch I just had. I tell him that I had just got a call from his colleague who was coming up to my room to take payment for the room service the previous night and can pay the lunch as well with this colleague. The receptionist who called earlier turns up at my room but she only has the bill for the room service the night before not my room service lunch, I then had to call the waiter who brought my lunch, now he wants to come up to my room with a credit card machine for the lunch bill, I get annoyed and tell him that its highly inconvenient, I already have his colleague with me and she can take the payment for the lunch, I get the total for this and add it on to the bill for the previous night. Again, this was very poor service, what I have a particular issue with is a lack of trust, in most hotels you can settle on the room service bill at checkout, its not like I am just going to run off. I am also aware that your hotel at checkout will want me to pay the tax bill for my stay and would expect the room service bill to be sorted then.Overall, so far the service has been poor and fails to meet the 5 star rating this hotel has. More worryingly is the differences in treatment I noticed at breakfast service in particular. I also question if the room service fiasco may also be influenced by race. Either way, I will be looking to stay at a different hotel when I am next in Cape Town."

You will be stopped from entering the gate by a bunch of miserable guards, and will have to wait until the owner decides to allow you to go up. The room itself is small, with very basic amenities, and a few cockroaches just like Chungking Mansions. The reception is manned by a sociallyawkward yokel who dislikes foreigners but not their money as evidenced by his liberal use of Cantonese racial slurs, be prepared to be referred to as the gweipo, gweilo, aachaa, hukgwei, etc..

The place has always been affordable, which is why I have always looked past the filthy rooms and seedy people living there. Unfortunately, the last time I stayed there, I experienced such poor customer service and disrespect from the staff that I no longer will stay there. I will say the general manager was very apologetic when I called to inform him about my experience a couple days later. The woman at the front desk, as well as the cleaning staff, showed absolutely zero professionalism or sympathy, even after I pointed out their mistake with my booking and customer service experience there as well. The cleaning staff laughed at me and made racial slurs at me when I went to make a complaint at the front desk! The assistant manager looked as if she wanted to jump me, after I simply asked the question, ""excuse me""....I had to explain to her that I was simply asking her to repeat her last statement. I left feeling that the women working had some kind of personal problem with me for no reason. I was so shaken up by their disrespect. I hope that the appropriate changes in customer service training will be taken for the sake of the other customers like me."

Knights Inn advertises that this rag of a hotel provides a continental breakfast, which consists of coffee and toast.  The milk for the coffee was rancant, curled up in my coffee.  The owner agrued it was fine, when he poured it out, chunks flowed from the container.  He still claimed it was fine.  Maybe in India, but not in the US.  I will never say her again.

The breakfast was okay, pretty much the same as every hotel, but they were a bit slow in restocking the hot food. One of the pans was empty when we went for breakfast, and we were almost finished eating by the time it was finally restocked. And last, but certainly not least, when we were checking in, during the conversation with the front desk clerk, she made a couple of racial stereotype comments not about us that were rather surprising to hear and not what we've come to expect when checking into a hotel.I did bring our issues to management shortly after our stay, and we received an email rather quickly.

This was my second stay in less than 2 weeks. First of all, they have room access problems. The company wants you 'ditch' the card key and use their app to access your room. Even though the app is a waste of life they encourage you to use it by making the carded entry troublesome. Every other entry the card fails forcing residents back to the front desk for assistance. My 3pm late check out was under the wire and I was locked out of my room. I asked the manager for 10 additional minutes beyond 3pm and Doris expressed what she thought of me by asking: ""How'd you even get a late check out in the first place"" Shocked by her query I immediately asked, 'How else does one authorize a late checkout other than paying for it' Before she could answer I continued, 'Ms Doris I'm asking because I'm using the time I've paid for to replace faulty key cards.' ""That's not my problem,"" she said. ""I need my room at 3."" I reminded her that I had chosen this specific Hampton Inn twice in less than two weeks and asked politely one last time: ""Is that how you practice quality customer service here at Hampton Inn, Doris"" She dug her heels in and reminded me that I could stay as long as I liked when I pay for it.I left ontime. I went to the front desk and asked for the district supervisor's contact info. Doris gave me a business card for the front desk. I know because I immediately called the number in front of Doris. When her coworker Joy answered the phone this further confirmed she had no respect for me as a person. She did not care enough about my experience to help me make it right with 10additional minutes nor by honoring my request to share my experiences with her supervisors. People of Colour BEWARE! Hampton Inn Seaport has no respect for you. Should you cross paths with Doris, save your common courtesies. She will literally insult you to your face. She does not care about your dollars nor does she believe in providing quality customer service for People of Colour. BEWARE!!Hampton Inn please note your coworker Doris may be knowledgeable in her field but she is reprehensible as a human. Training her to be a civil human may require racial sensitivity training. What qualifies me to say this I am a professional who has been studying body language for nearly 24 years. If your management team could have witnessed how she spoke to me thru her nonverbal ques you would be embarrassed. People of Colour  BEWARE!"
Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg635767d1014044r591446320AndaluciaBeachHotelResidenceEleniteBurgasProvince.html,Date of stay: June 2018,Andalucia Beach Hotel  Residence,Europe,Bulgaria,Burgas Province,unknown,An Honest Review of an Abysmal Place,"We had a late night/early morning arrival time of 3:00am, the hotel was not organised for us no key so had to wait at the reception to have this sorted.  The entire staff did not speak basic English so was difficult to communicate.  Finally, we were put into a spare room, not the seaview in which we paid for, but a small unclean room with big brown stains on the carpet  however as this was now 4:00am we put up with it and went to sleep.  By chance, we bumped into the nightshift receptionist at the bar the following morning where we were advised we were in the wrong room and had to move our own bags to our new room without any assistance from the staff.  Although described as a double bed in both rooms, this was 2 single beds which had been pushed together.  In general we found that the staff we spoke to were unhelpful and rude.The hotel is equipped with several elevators throughout the building, however only 1 worked which had to the used by both staff and guests.  The room service times were inconstant, varying between 7:00am to 11:00am meaning on several occasions our room was not cleaned.  However, even when we did receive this service our room was far from clean  they made the beds and swiftly left, meaning the floor was sandy all week and the bathroom was not cleaned.  As there was noone attending our room, noone had restocked our toilet roll on 2 nonconsecutive days so we had to find someone on both occasions where were met with blank stares as noone spoke English or Bulgarian.When we asked the receptionist the easiest way to the pool, we were advised we had to go out the main entrance and walk around the whole hotel as there was no shortcut.  The sunbeds beside the pool were very limited for the amount of guests in the hotel, and although there was a sign illustrating that people were not meant to reserve these, there was people who went to put their towels on these prior to breakfast and didnt use these all day  meaning they were unavailable for guests who wanted to use them.No racial conjecture implied; the guests were predominantly Russian and Polish  no other British people in the entire village.  We did not feel welcome and we were stared at on many occasions as if from outer space.  Few of the staff were actually Bulgarian, as was confirmed by a barman at a bar out with the hotel.  Overall, not a friendly place for British people.  The hotel was full of families, however it felt as though children were left to run riot around the hotel whilst the adults were downstairs at the bar.  Therefore, kids were screaming down the halls at all hours of the day and night, with parents screaming all through the night down round the pool.  There was rubbish left on our doorstep for us to trip on by either children or parents, who knows.As we were all inclusive, we were looking forward to food and drink being provided throughout the day.  However, this hope was met with more subsequent disappointment of the hotel.  The doors were left open all through meal times, so the entire room was full of flies which walked over all the food as nothing was covered or protected from these.  Every day each meal was cold, no matter was time you arrived.  There was no queueing system, so guests pushed in front and on more than one occasion, I was elbowed and someone stood on my foot and shot me a look as if I was in the wrong.  The meat on offer was incorrectly labelled, an example when the dish was labelled chicken and it was brown/grey.  There was a freezer available full of ice cream, which noone manned so it was a freeforall.  The flavours were not labelled so you were unaware of each flavour and the scoops provided were not functional and did not release the ice cream so was constantly full of various flavours.  On only a few occasions they provided a small jug of water to clean the scoops, however this was dirty and was not changed for the hour we were sat near it, truly repulsive.  The last straw was when we watched a little girl put ice cream on her cone, lick the scoop and proceed to stack her cone using the same scoop, repeating each and every time.  The drinks were also vile, the fruit juice which included apple and orange was pure syrup and sugar, not fresh which we were expecting.  Our saving grace was a small supermarket where we could purchase a few items.  In the whole 7 days we were there, I was unwell 1 day and my girlfriend was unwell 5 days.  When we had finally had enough of the horrendous food on offer, we wanted to try an onsite village restaurant but you were unable to go to any of the restaurants without a reservation  which you had to book in the hotels.  There was a small window of between 10:00am and 11:00am to book these by one guest relations officer, after waiting in the queue for 40 minutes, we were told that he was no longer taking any reservations today and he had places to beappalling customer service, as us and the man behind us had been waiting for an extremely long period of time.Our experience was far from satisfactory so was really looking forward to our departure day.  The transfer was 22:50pm, the checkout time was 12:00pm, and the receptionist expected the bands to be cut off at 12:30pm  meaning we would be without food, drink and toilets for over 10 hours.In our stay, we spent the entire time being as polite as we possibly could be given the circumstances, no complaints were raised to the staff or other guests despite their behaviour.  We hope in writing this, someone will read this and avoid the ENTIRE Elenite holiday village.  Go to Sunny Beach or a different country altogether.  The hotel does not deserve the 4 rating and definitely unworthy of the price tag attached for staying."

Mistake. There was no elevator that went from lobby to our floor, the bedside tables had to be plugged in and unplugged to turn on and off, and the floor lamp had no lightbulbs. We stayed in a smoking room and there were burns in the comforter! Not to mention they rerented our room while we were out and gave someone else keys to our room! WTH The 3rd shift manager has no customer service skills and should be fired for the way he spoke to my husband and I. I am hoping it was not a racial bias."

My family arrived in the evening for checkin. We tried to stop at the front, where there's a sign that states that you can stop for 10min for checkin. A man, that later turned out to be the hotel's manager, standing near the front kept shooing us forward, so we decided to just drive on, and park in the back parking lot instead. After rudely and repeatedly telling us to keep driving, the manager then tried to open our friend's rear passenger door  they were following behind us in their car. She initially thought he was opening her door for checkin, so she told him that she wasn't checking in; that the car in front of her us was actually customers trying to check in, and didn't understand why he didn't let us stop to check in. He claimed that she was his Uber driver, and when she said she and her daughter were not Uber drivers, he pointed out that her car fit the description for his Uber ride. When we tried to check in after we parked, the receptionist told my husband that they were cancelling our reservation, and that the owner told him to do so. When my husband turned to tell me this, we were in shock. The receptionist stated that the hotel reserved the right to refuse service to us. We were taken aback, and confused, as we had just entered the lobby, and didn't know what we had done wrong. We asked to speak with the owner or manager. The receptionist contacted him, and about 2030min later, the owner/manager, Chirag , called the front desk, and spoke with my husband, and then to me. He claimed that our friend had been rude, and despite not being their customer, he was refusing us service because she is our friend. He denied thinking she was an Uber driver, and accused her of using a racial slur. She never saw his face from the driver's seat, would never say anything like that, and she didn't understand why he would accuse her of that. Of note, my husband and I are minorities, as are our friend and her daughter, and she would never do anything like that. They were so taken aback by all this, and asked if this stuff happens normally in America. They are visiting relatives nearby, and are from Egypt. The man was belligerent and hostile in his words and attitude. When I told him that we had two young children with us and that he's throwing us out late it was only 8:30pm, but this is late for our children at night without a place to stay, he said, 'you're welcome.' It seems that we were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and suffered because the owner was in a bad mood and took it out on us  it's scary that he would do this to customers on a whim, and seems like he had a power trip.It was a difficult night for our family. We and our friends were hurt and upset by Mr. 's actions, and by his accusations. Only after did we see on Yelp and other review sites that many others have made similar complaints about this hotel and the staff. I encourage others who've had bad experiences to contact the larger corporation, and BBB."

Our family of 5 stayed for 8 days for my child's sports tournament. Our room was never cleaned ""refreshed"" properly on any day. Some days, they would take our dirty towels but not bring new ones so we would have to go hunt them down. They would make up one bed but not the other one. They never emptied the trash. They once took the trash can away and just threw a new plastic trash can liner on the floor by the toilet. We always ran out of toilet paper and had to go get more. Every single day we had to contact the front desk for several issues. Once when I called, my husband happened to be standing at the front desk with other customers. He watched the front desk woman say our name and room number aloud, make a loud sigh, and just pick up the phone and hang back up on me. The evening manager promised we would have a full cleaning due to so many mishaps but it wasn't done the next day. We had to call again and finally they did a shoddy full cleaning the evening before we checked out but they put a bloody sheet on one of our beds. I think it was intentional. The evening manager told us that their cleaning crew kept quitting and they were using people from other local hotels. I'm sure it is because the management is so poor. On the day before we left, we discussed our concerns with the day manager and she said they would compensate us for this horrendous stay. The day of check out the overall manager said there was nothing he was going to do, he never apologized and told us that ""if we had problems after the first day, we should have found another place to stay"". I detected some racial overtones in his treatment of my husband that are of great concern to me. We called the corporate Marriott office to file a complaint and were told they would contact us within 3 days. It has been two weeks. We will never stay at a Marriott again."

Guess she didnt mind the two people waiting on her in front of me so we could also check in  Finally get to my room which was next to the kitchen area only to hear through the walls what to be the cook complaining about other workers and using racial slurs. Didnt bother eating at the restaurant, looked dirty.The room was spacious and appeared to be clean but was so dusty I think I could of picked up asthma from my two night stay. The bathroom area could of used a good scrubbing and the carpet didnt look like it was vacuumed in months. I dont think any of the housekeepers vacuum between the bed and drawers being their was crackers crumbs and used condom rapper laying there. I found out what housekeeper cleaned my room and her name is Reneta. I highly recommend management to retrain this person in cleanliness. The room has an iron, blow dryer, coffee maker and laundry service. This room you could hear all the noise from the kitchen to guests coming and going out the doors in the hallway. Since I was only here after 3pm I had to listen to the kitchen noise till 10pm.My second day here I went up to the front desk to ask about transfers and I do not know what was going on in back but it sounded like a circus! Loud music being played and people laughing and talking so loud with bad language I couldnt believe management would approve of this type of setting or even if they cared!Didnt bother to use the pool or gym being most of the hotel looked dusty and dirty. Also looked like the housekeepers needed to be kept busy instead of talking bad about what appeared to be other employees right outside my door. This hotel is way over priced for what it offers. Too bad because its a nice area and appears to be going downhill from what another guest told me who regularly stays in the area. Wont be back."

I also needed a hand towel and sleepers as I didn't bring mine. At this stage I was told the hotel does not have guest services. This is when I told them I will be checking out the following  day.Came the morning, breakfast , it is clear that the lady who prepares the eggs has no culinary training or any  hospitality training.

There is no cleaning service: that means you may either keep the same uncleaned sheets and towels for a week or you wash them yourself. The rooms smell like pot. The hotel manager is not friendly nor available.  The place is ok if you are just looking for a place to stay while you look for an apartment or room for rent. The room I stayed in was next to the manager's house so I got good WiFi. I had several issues with the bookings.com portal, though.  They charged me both my stay and a noshow fee for not being there during the checkin hours, even though they had info about my flight and time of arrival with a month notice.  I ended up paying twice the original amount.  I am still fighting them and arguing after I have already left the place.

Perusing the TV, you have your Jay Leno, Jimmy Fallon and then interracial group porn.  Not pay per view, just on a channel.  You could hear the lovely sounds of the previously banned alleged prostitutes wafting through the fan in shower, which went unused.  Luckily we only were there 6 hours.  The front desk called us a 'cab', which turned out to be I assume a relative with some sketchy livery 'licenses' in the prius.  Nice enough guy, took about 15 minutes to get there hindsight I could have flagged down an actual cab in about 1 minute out front and it was a 40 ride when it should have been about 1015 in a cab."

We even passed by the front desk on one occasion and heard a conversation between the guy and a guest where the guest was saying how unsegregated the area has become and its not what he was used to in this area. Smh. So if you plan to stay here, please know that this is Forsyth County Gasimply google it with a very small AA population less than 4 and a history of some extreme racial tension, so we were not suprised at all by his comments or the overall lack of friendliness during our stay.The room was much smaller than expected and had no sofa or loveseat as the pictures showed when we booked it. The AC unit is one of those older model ones that sits under the window and is controlled by the thermostat on the wall. It didnt cool very well or circulate throughout the room. It was VERY loud....so loud that we had to have the tv volume at 25 to hear over it. And it was difficult sleeping through the noise especially if you are accustomed to a very peaceful nights sleep. The cleanliness of the bathroom was disappointing. And when we arrived, one of the pillowcases had a large amount of dry blood on it!! We left the pillow on the floor for housekeeping to take with them the next morning, however when we returned the following day housekeeping had put it back on the bed when they came to ""clean""!!!! I called to notify the front desk, and because the lady very nice and apologetic was alone down there I had to get back dressed and go down to get a clean pillow. The pool was very small, almost like a large hot tub. We did not bother with getting in. Overall, for the price of about 175 per night total there are definitely much better choices in the area. Go a few exits up 811 on the Fulton County side for nice accommodations, more welcoming environment, and a better value. We will not return, or recommend this hotel to any of our clients.  "

All swimming happily, myself and spouse included, were black.  Strange older white woman approaches and ask "" What's your room "". She didn't ID herself as management and it wasn't until after some disclosed personal info of room  that she explained concern about unwelcome local  kids sneaking onto property for a swim. We were all adults and paying customers. One person said their number and she replied, ""All of you"". She assumed we were together. I felt unsafe for several reasons. 1 I may have looked like I was with the other occupancy but just because I was same color doesn't make this a fact. I did not want to disclose my room number to them. and 2 I did not want to disclose my room to her. She was a stranger as well. And, with Georgia being at the top of list for sex trafficking, I had no interest in disclosing my personal whereabouts since her intentions were not clear yet. My husband was traveling on business and during day I was left alone at hotel. I didn't want uninvited guest.  Later my husband identified her as someone from front desk. Why didn't she recognized me he asked. Everyone swimming that day concluded same idea.  If all white folks were in the pool, no questions would have been asked. Simply too many blacks in one space at one time having fun. That made someone nervous. Thinking back, I recall white visitors on balcony towel in hand looking like they were missing out. I understand she has business concerns to prioritize but perhaps she should take this up with pesky locals not pay customers. Suggestion: Maybe a pool wristband would help. That way visitors can enjoy without harassment. rm204"

She looked disgusted, and didn't smile not once and had this really horrible attitude. Upon my check out the other front desk attendant was rude as well and I heard her talked down upon her coworkers. My race is African American and she refused to look me in eye, but when this causcian walked in her attitude completely changed. I feel like that was racial discrimination and I really should report this to Wyndham Corporate."

The receptionist didnt know what that was. Didnt receive any of the package amenities such as Premium Internet or 10 toward inhotel store purchase.

Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg297967d575611r512756936GrandSekerHotelManavgatTurkishMediterraneanCoast.html,Date of stay: August 2017,Grand Seker Hotel,Europe,Turkey,Turkish Mediterranean Coast,"London, United Kingdom",4 night birthday holiday,"I stayed at this hotel with my sister for 4 nights. To begin with i'd like to be clear that i am in no way racist... if you are black DO NOT STAY HERE or even land at Antalya International airport... THE AIRPORTWhen going through passport control, there were 5 different queues; Disabled passengers2 for Turkish citizens2 for E passportsNo one knew which to stand in until a security officer came out and told us to queue anywhere so we did. We queued for 30mins in the shortest queue which was for disabled passengers. Once we got to the desk the woman behind the desk asked us for our visas which we didn't know we needed. I explained i wasn't told to get one to which she sucked her teeth, rolled her eyes and pointed us to the left with a snap. So we went to the office that she directed us to and i explained that i needed a visa but only had Turkish liyra. She made out she didn't understand and that i couldn't pay in liyra only euros and dollars. I asked her where i could take out the correct money and she shooed me off. So we went looking for a cash point and couldn't find any... i decided to go to the window next to her and ask again and was able to obtain a visa for 120tl make sure you have your visa before travelling I'm not entirely sure if everyone had to but i did once i got back to my sister she explained that whilst i was walking away the woman was flapping Turkish liyra around whilst pulling faces so she knew i could pay in tl... from the moment i arrived in the airport i was met with racial hostility from staff. Because of all of this we missed our shuttle but luckily, a gentle man was able to take us.ARRIVALThe hotel was almost an hour away from the hotel. Once we arrived at GS we were met by 2 lovely hospitality staff; a young man who looked like MJ and another older man unfortunately i was too exhausted to get their names. We were then taken to our rooms in a slightly run down lift that spoke weirdly once we reached the 4th floor. There were buggies and prams in the corridors which sometimes got in the way of traveling around the hotel.ROOM STANDARDSOur room was standard but not 4. The bathroom light made an electrical buzzing sound when you turned it off as if it were to explode and the main shower head churned violently when you turned it on and constantly dripped if you used the smaller shower head instead. The shower doors were a little worn and by our 2nd day one had unhinged.The floors in the room weren't mopped for the duration of our stay but the room in general was very clean. The beds were like sleeping on the floor with absolutely no bounce to provide a decent sleep unless you were wasted. We went to the beach on the 2nd day and i noticed my hip was stinging where the bed sheets had scratched me and i ended up with scale like cuts. The bed was awful. There were 2 plug ports one across the room and the other in the wardrobe so i had to sleep away from my phone which made turning my alarm off very difficult.To get away from all of the German and Polish people who constantly starred, laughed and pointed at us, we stayed in our room most evenings although that was a difficult task. In the hotel manual it states that they have tv channels in several languages; this was false, everything was either in Turkish, Polish or German. Everything from avengers, comedy central, cartoon network, csi and the big bang theory. There was absolutely NOTHING to watch so we ended up paying 24tl for wifi that barely worked. I called reception to ask and they confirmed there were no english channels; we went to the shop and got a pack of uno cards. The air con was a huge nuisance, trying to find a decent setting was a nightmare so we would often wake up super dehydrated or shivering. The minibar was stocked with 3 bottles of water. The room had a decent sized balcony but it faced another hotel and a short road, however it was pretty handy because they played decent music occasionally and made a nice background for photos. If you looked completely far right you could see mountains in the distance and to the far left the sea.FOODThe food was always the same, although there was a small menu that was given to us on a hotel timetable which was really handy which had specialities on different days but that wasn't the case. The food was out so there were often flies buzzing around or stuck to the food so you had to be careful what you were eating. The catering staff and waiting staff were lovely... waiting to het food was difficult especially if you have O.C.D because there were so many kids running around using their hands and coughing around the food, their parents didn't seem to care much. There was an freshly squeezed orange juice table; i walked past and could smell a mildew kind of smell, when i looked into the bowl half of the oranges were rotten. The juice costed 1 for a glass. The meal schedule for fully incl was breakfast, lunch, snacks burger  chips, dinner and midnight soup which was whatever was left over; so chicken soup after roast chicken at dinner etc. The juices tasted like they were spiked with vinegar so we stuck to chips and Fanta or 7up. Most days we had to go to the local restaurant to eat because we didn't enjoy the hotel meals and so we were starving!Make sure you get your alcohol at duty free as the drinks served were not nice at all.On a positive note, my sister managed to get a table dressed for my birthday breakfast which was really lovely.POOLS, ENTERTAINMENT AND SPAThere were 3 pools; main pool with slides and bar, medium sized pool and paddling pool. They were checked regularly by specialist staff so i was very happy with that. The pools were always packed but when the children came over it was pretty busy. The entertainment was terrible and we heard the same activities at least 3 times whilst we were there. Again we didn't join in due to the starring and children running scared of us.The spa therapist who was hounding us was very irritating. We were sun bathing and he came over and started a conversation which then proceeded into a demonstration totally get that he has to promote the spa but he often disturbed us. We finally gave in and asked for prices although i had wanted to get treatments done on my birthday. He explained the prices which he said was 30tl35tl he asked us to add it up so we did but  apparently it equalled 50tl instead, he was anxious to book us in and asked us again the next 2 days until it was uncomfortable seeing him.OTHER FACILITIESIn the hotel there are a few other services;A little shopOpticiansHair salonSpaSouvenir shopBag shopClothes shop super expensive almost 8 32tl for a sarong and the man was very rude and impatient because he couldn't understand mePhoto memorabilia we purchased a plate for 65tl but you may have to order it straight away as it takes 24hrsDiscoTHE BEACHThe beach was a 10min walk from the hotel. It had different sections for different hotels. There was food left on the side uncovered for guests and several birds were just pecking away. You would only see ""the beauty"" of it on alecarte evenings which i still wouldn't attend because the food is constantly left out. The sections had a large amount of loungers, some that were under a mass shelter and others that were dotted around closer to the sea which was good. The beach was relatively clean until you got to the end.THE AREAThere strip is very long with numerous shops selling pretty much the same thing. There are 3 or 4 convenient stores which would as you where you were from in a ""friendly"" way so they could bump the prices up if you said London. They sold lots of haribo, pringles and mms but nothing else familiar other than those.There were 3 main restaurants close to the hotel; a grotty looking kebabish, a slightly pricey shisha restaurant and a casual restaurant called Saray Restaurant owned by a lovely man. The food was quite nice especially the pizza and the service is lovely! A margarita pizza is 12.Further down to the right is a small shopping centre full of eager salesman that hound you as you walk past asking where you're from. They don't accept bartering so its best to look around the whole centre for better prices.If you fancy kfc or burger king you're looking at 1530 min taxi drive as the hotel is nowhere near the city!!!CHECKING OUTChecking out was awful. We were expected to stay all day without a shower. We checked out at 12 and our shuttle wasn't arriving until 7pm. We asked for a day room to freshen up before traveling home and we were directed to a single shower that had a missing shower door so water went everywhere. I paid for my wifi but i had my last day included so i could make contact with people especially as it was my birthday, however my wifi wasn't working. When i went to reception and explained the situation they said i had checked out so i had to go to the manager and demand that i had access to the wifi or my money back.Overall i will NEVER stay there again, its not 4 and not worth the money i spent."

Belvoir,United States,Virginia VA,Alexandria,unknown,Racially Harassed by Staff and guest,"Awful treatment. The manager allowed other guest to make racial and harassing comments to me while these guest were blocking me in my room at the rooms door. The hotel security was standing watching them harassing me and they did nothing to stop it. The other guest were repeadily calling me a white bith at my door when a member of the hotel staff brought me a new room key to a different room because the neighbors were harassing us threw the walls for absolutely no reason. After going to a new room that was not very clean and not what I booked, I called the manager to discuss the room and the harassment. She spoke over me and did not allow me to speak. When I told her that I felt the need to call Best Western Corporate, she told me I had to leave and said she was calling the police. As a very law abiding citizen and someone who only treats people kindly, I did leave because I dont need to be involved in that. She also refused a refund after she made us leave due to my worries of being racially harassed and approached aggressively by other said guest. Im very glad that the hotel has video surveillance cameras near the door of my original room and vehicle that was parked outside. The videos will be extremely useful."

I don't speak german or would have done it myself, she made such a ig deal out of it and in the end did not do it and even misguided me that it cannot be done on the phone . ultimately I got someone else to help my from a shop and got it done on the phone.now to some more serious matters. I had a booking here only for 2 days and I wanted to extend for another 2 days as I absolutely loved the hotel inspite of our dear friendly lady she tells me there is no chance of extending as they are totally sold out this was at 8 pm before the day I had to check out. so I packed up all my stuff and was ready to check out next day after breakfast. I saw a more approachable lady at the reception and asked her if I could extend. and surprise surprise she said of course I could.as there was room in the hotel. as if this was not enough frau martin caused further trouble for me I am sure intentionally since I was cxhecking out early on 24th dec moring I went to settle my bill on 23rd night itself.i was utterly dismayed to see frau martin at the reception I suspect the feelings were mutual I requested her to do the billing and as I never check I paid the 576 euroes by amex card which she asked for without a thought and went to my room.just by intuition I checked the bill once in my room and no surprise frau martin had charged me 42 euroes extra. I went down and pointed out her error which she was not willing to admit for atleast 10 minutes.then I gave her the day by day break up and showed my booking copies to her again.she cancelled the transction and charged my card again for the correct amount.as my account is in rupees amex charged me quite a sizeable amount as foreign exchange difference which I had to pay for no fault of mine. thre was another lady at the reception when I checked out,and just becose I forgot the card key inb the room slot she gave me such a dirty look as if I had commited a serious crime. all aspects of this hotel are very very good,  even the price is definetly worth the hotel. would highly recommend staying here if you can stay clear of frau martin. I hope the management realizes that they truly have a really nice hotel and should make the most of it by keeping appropriate staff who are suited for the job. the hotel has an indoor pool and freee wifi which works pretty well. the room also has an heater and a clothes drier in the bathroom. I have travelled all over Europe but never seen staff which goes out of its way to cause problem to its guests. since no other guests have seemed to complained about this earliear reviews I suspect there may be an racial shade to this treatement as we are from india."

We had read other rebiews about loud campers but didn't think it would be a big issue. It was! Our neighbors a large group shined a bright light into our tent, yelled and played loud music until past 3:00 AM. When they were asked to be quiet, they laughed. It took until 2:00 AM for any park employee to come out. After he left they used racial slurs, cursed and said they were going to get their money's worth. He came again after 3:00 AM. They laughed about him getting overtime. Nothing was done. We complained the next day and were offered a new site. We declined and left. We talked to a dad at the playground who had a similar issue on the other side of camp. Apparently it seems to be a known thing that you can be loud, rude and inconsiderate and nothing happens. This creates bigger issues. Also dogs on the beach in the swim area when the sign clearly said no pets. Three employees walked by and didn't enforce. Once again, people will do whatever if rules aren't enforced. Will never go again and will tell everyone not to go. But don't worry the people that are rude will keep coming back and bring lots of friends."

Just avoid it in the future as there are so many choices nearby. The front desk guys were cold and impatient. They refused to recognize my silver status membership; we were charged extras without shown any official receipt I filed a complaint to Accor but still have not received the receipt after 3 weeks.; they offered cash exchange service but refused to change even only 200USD for us. When we were leaving negative comments in Booking.com, we were shocked to find out that the hotel is notorious for providing poor service and overcharging especially towards Asians China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, etc.. I guess racial discrimination is the worst comment that a hotel could ever receive."

The elevator looked old and buttons were broken.  Our floor smelled like smoke.  The door to our room did not seem secure. The lock was loose.  The room smelled like mold and the carpet had weird stains. The faucets were rusted.  Even though we were in a non smoking floor, the bathtub had cigarette stains on it.  There is a microwave in the room however looked like it was just thrown in to cover a hole. It was even unplugged and when we went to plug it, the plug wouldnt reach the wall.  We had to take it down, put it on the floor so we could plug it while we heated up some food. The so called gym was a total joke. The elpticas machine had wires coming out of it and the plastic cover for the motor was broken and in the floor. The Nautilus machine had all the cables and pulleys broken on the floor. The next morning we had an eh breakfast.  Coffee tasted like dirty water. There were dead flies on the floor by the window. As we went back to the room, I saw a guest causing a commotion yelling and cursing at the clerk with racial connotations which scared my kids. I thought to myself, what kind of people stay here Well from this experience, very questionable people at best.  The overall cleanliness of the hotel is poor. The overall cleanliness of the room is poor. We sucked it up because it was only 2 nights and there was no vacancy elsewhere. Will NOT stay here ever again."

John is a large man and stood in the doorway to prevent us leaving and demanded full payment even though we had not reserved.

We were there for 2 nights. Staff was mostly courtesy, our room was very clean and spacious, we picked a corner room on the Hilton app. The only issue I had with the room is the outer curtains didn't close all the way and inner curtains were veil thin so there still light from the streets coming in and then the sun in the morning. Still had a few good nights of sleep. Bed was comfortable as you can adjust the firmness and temperature control was steady.We had breakfast there our first morning, we waited to be seated for a few minutes and asked a staff member if we should seat ourselves. They showed us to a table and explain it was a buffet style, also they weren't our server. The food choices were little to choose from, they had some made to order items. Not being hopeful, I asked if they had turkey bacon, they didn't but had turkey sausage I was pleasantly surprised. Made to order items will be brought to your table. We saw our server twice to bring utensils and the made to order food, then she disappeared. We manage to get a cup of ice from her since I wanted ice coffee and it at first seemed selfserved. We heard her asked everyone else if they wanted coffee or water and the were brought mugs and glasses. We were never asked. Kind of put off by that, we kept getting up to get our own water and coffee at the self service welcome station with paper cups until they ran out of coffee at 10 am...mind you this was only the self serving kind. We were advised by another employee it would be refilled and to ask our server for more coffee. When we finally got our server's attention for water and coffee, she only brought out 1 water and coffee and ran off. There were two of us... my husband went to the buffet and had chocolate milk until we Overall the food and coffee were decent we both enjoyed our own pork and turkey sausage but the service needs to be work on. I'm not sure why we received poor service; the only differences between us and other tables with couples were we were a younger couple and a biracial one. I am not claiming bias as my husband is the same race as the server, honestly, our server just seemed lost in space but it doesn't account for her being attentive to the other tables and not us.I didn't use any of the other amenities like the pool working, business center or gym. We had a few drinks at the bar both nights. They were good and reasonable price, however some garnish would've been nice for my cocktail. Also, they had Cruzan rum listed on the menu but only carried two other standard rums. I wish they would update their menu as no reason was offer why they didn't have it. The bar area is very small so most guests were making use of the lobby seating and breakfast tables, it made for a cozy and comfortable atmosphere. I would stay here again, however we would take our chances crossing the busy road to have breakfast at Starbucks or go further into town and eat at a cafe like we did the second morning."

Pic shows two.  One tray of scrambled eggs and sausage patties.  There wasn't enough room for everyone and there was a group of teenage boys hovering around the food and hogging the 1 waffle maker.  Their language was offensive and racial slurs were being dropped making guests uncomfortable.  They were African American dropping the n word at eachother.  The breakfast area could use another waffle maker and tray of eggs and sausage for the number of guests who were staying there.  Wait time did not permit several people to take advantage of the free breakfast which is taken I to consideration when booking a hotel.  Just drop the breakfast and lower your price by 20 bucks and it would cut your expenses and provide a better stay experience for your guests.

I have spent many months in city around the world. This place was the largest rip off I have come across. Everything is over priced and not good. Breakfast buffet was a total rip. The worse show of using a big name for overcharging guests. Many staff could not speak English which is disappointing. I am North American and found this hotel to have a racial component as well. Seemed a bit that all of Japan did. I just didnt expect it at my hotel. Ordered our 25 bar drinks after waiting for 15 mins just to wait another 20 mins to get it. However some Japanese guests treated instantly. We looked presentable and did not cause trouble. Were just North American. Our room was facing the train tracks so loud all day. The 2 elevator systems sucks if you want to enjoy the outside and come back in. The gym is very small. Location is good that thats going for them.

Always a good reminder, that even in 2019, in this part of Goa, people just don't know how to treat people decently, and more importantly  professionally.I stayed a couple of nights in Mandrem, and went to Dunes for dinner on both nights. It wasn't too busy on the first night, and though the staff was fairly surly I just assumed they were always like that, I received my order quickly, and it was tasty.I came back the second night, and it was a lot busier. I had to wait to be seated, and though they had a few tables open in the back section, I wanted to sit in the front by the sea. A table right by the front became available after a few minutes, and the waiter indicated that I should go and sit there, and said that he would be with me shortly.As I was walking towards my table, I saw a young, foreign couple get up from their table towards the back and start rushing towards the empty table that was supposed to be mine. They got there a second after I did, and the girl grabbed the chair and squeezed past me to try and sit down. It was absurd that they were behaving that desperately in the first place, but I calmly said to her that this was my table. She responded by saying that they'd been wanting to sit there, and I merely said that I'd been waiting, and this is where I'd been seated.By this time the waiter had arrived at the table, and when confronted by a scene where he presumably had to choose between pleasing a slightly unreasonable foreign couple, or doing his duty and seating his Indian customer, he chose the former.He motioned with his hand towards the table that they'd just vacated, and said ""go sit over there"" in Hindi, and gave them the table at the front.I contemplated making a scene, but decided not to go through the trouble of doing so, since sorting this out was their responsibility and not mine. Giving the couple the benefit of the doubt, I asked the waiter if perhaps they had put their names down and asked to move tables earlier, but he confirmed that no, they hadn't. I asked him on what basis he gave them the table over me, and he shrugged and said ""what do you want me to do"".At this point, I told him that it was pretty clear where his ideals were, and he just smirked and walked off. I left the restaurant feeling quite sickened and upset at being treated like this  I honestly don't know why this kind of thing still happens. It's a beach shack in Mandrem after all, so it's not like spending power is really a factor here.I called the place later, and made a complaint to the management. They barely bothered to listen to the call, and ended it saying they would pass my ""feedback"" on. I'm pretty sure that went nowhere."

Next day morning, everyone happily coming down for breakfast and another nightmare happened.They have been told to have breakfast at a room which did not have food then our tour leader asked staff for help but no one help or not even care about them. No choice we decided to ask all our clients to join FIT breakfast.Manager Melanie is very rude, racism  discrimination.

However, compared to other four seasons branches the resort in Mauritius seemed more like a 3 star hotel in terms of ethical standards and service. We had an incident where we were subject to a racist attack and verbal abuse by a couple at the beach because they wanted to sit on the beds that we were sitting at even though all other beds around us were empty. We were three girls wearing head scarfs and the foreign couple made comments about our head scarfs, the country we come from and gave us the middle finger. The beach attendant raised the matter to the management of the resort as he seemed genuinely concerned about us. However, the statements made by the resort management once they became aware of the incident were very sad and alarming. The front desk manager stated the following ""the couple's behavior is not a breach of any law in Mauritius and the resort can't do anything about it"", ""the guy is from Italy and giving hand gestures is something normal"" and ""only if there was physical abuse then we can take action against it"". Further, they assured us that we will not encounter the couple for the rest of our stay at the resort but nothing was done by the resort. We have encountered the same couple at every restaurant we had breakfast and dinner at. The resort became a very hostile environment for us following the incident. I don't think the staff at the resort understand the magnitude of racism as they tried to offer us spa treatment to ""forget about what happened"". The code of ethics available on the four seasons website clearly states that verbal abuse will not be tolerated. But, their own staff don't uphold any of the integrity and ethical standards mentioned under their own code. Nowadays, even small shops that are desperate for business take firm actions against racism by reporting it to authorities and refusing to host racist people and a 5 star resort like four seasons decided to tolerate racism and do nothing about the matter."

As a former travel executive I could vouch that Amil K. is wrongfully referring to the world wide policy of hotels allowing only guests to use the pool. Hotels all over the world from Las Vegas strip to Maldives use this policy to provide privacy for their guests. Amil K. must have attempted to use the hotel pool and was told that the pool is only for guests. People from Sri Lanka are very friendly and kind. They even do not have a word or term for racism in common use Sinhala language. I am not going to believe a hospitality industry worker from Sri Lanka would make such a comment even in private. But Amil K would like me to believe that the receptionist made such a comment to the face of the race that she was offending.The receptionist in question has the skin color of brown or black! Amil K. states that she is being racist to her own race If that is the case that is not racism. Amil K. has arguments that are horribly poor. Just like his spelling. I am going to be visiting Sri Lanka again soon and will make it a point to stay at this beautiful hotel. Furthermore, since I am going to be a hotel guest that will not mind paying my way I will be swimming in that inviting pool too."

The rooms were beautiful and the breakfast was great but if there's one thing that I stand firmly for, it would be the understanding of different cultures and acceptance of diversity. Traveled to Nea Kios with my hockey team mates for the EuroHockey Indoor Club Champions Challenge II. The majority of my team mates are pakistani and due to their religious beliefs, they can only eat halal meat. Since Nea Kios is such a small town, there is no halal meat available so they had no option that to order food to be delivered from Athens. We all gathered in a room, moved the furniture around, laid a sheet on the ground and placed the food on top, then sat in a circle and began to eat  something that they've done several times in other hotels in countries like Serbia, Turkey, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Sweden, and Germany. Next thing we know, the owner comes in screaming in half greek half english saying it was not allowed and we were destroying his hotel. Words cannot describe my horrifying experience. His rage was unnecessary and it got to the point of being violent  he had slammed his arm against the door, broke the bed after hitting it, and almost hit one of my team mates. He eventually yelled at all of us to get out and started picking up the food and almost throwing it on the ground outside. I didn't understand what we had done was wrong.His justification for reacting so strongly was that he had spent much of his time and money into building this hotel and we were destroying his room and it wasn't allowed to gather everyone in a room and eat together. Apparently, if he had called the tourist agency, we would of been taken and placed in jail for what we did... but honestly it's complete bs. If he didn't agree with us eating there he could of went about it in a much more rational matter but this man came raging in like we had ransacked his hotel. It saddens me to say but if I had been traveling with an all white team, we would of never have been placed in this situation. I understand Greece is going through harsh financial times and with all the illegal immigrants being deported back to Greece breeds much animosity between different races but that in no way validates discrimination and racism. You cannot judge a person based on stereotypes and assumptions. I've played hockey with these men for sometime now and I know they meant no harm; it's in their culture to gather together and eat... as it is in many others.How can the we make the world be a better place if we continue to close our eyes to different cultures and give into to stereotypes rather than change them Even if this hotel was the best, it's against my morals to condone to such behavior. I'd rather have slept in a sleeping bag on the beautiful beaches of Nea Kios..."

I thought it was going to be nothing more than pleasantries but to my dismay I was incorrect. Once I got to the resort I was nearly manhandled for my luggage by the concier. The gentleman continuously try to grab my bags. I told him more than three times I do not want my bags taken and place to the side. If he had secured my bags I would have been okay but he wanted to take my bags and put them in a pile of other guess bags that was no more than 10 feet away from the entrance into the resort. There was no one on constant watch of the luggage that sat in that position. I don't understand to take their luggage and just place it 10 to 15 ft away from the entrance especially during the time of now when we are experiencing high volume of terrorism and thievery. If that wasn't enough I went to the bar in the lobby a mature Russian lady was waiting to get the attention of the bartender before I got there I saw her from less than 5 ft away. I was second in line as I approach the bar. The bartender was speaking to a manager at the time no one else was serving drinks at that moment a gentleman if I should call him that approach the bar and as soon as the bartender and management had finished speaking the bartender looked over the lady that was waiting there. He directed his attention pointed to the male who walked up last and asked him what was he drinking the mail gave his order at that time I spoke out and said to the bartender that this gentleman was last the lady was first the bartender ignored me and continue to serve the mail that came last. I looked over to the lady and gestured would she speak up she told me don't worry about it. Once the man was served he made a smart comment to me and I informed him such behavior is not becoming. The bartender was informed by me once again that the man came last and should have been served last but not before the lady who was standing here. The bartender seemed as though he didn't understand what I said and told me as he motioned his hand to stop he said I'll serve you last. What was the reason for that He then served the lady and the lady walked past me with her drinks and said sexism. The bartender then came over to me and said what do you want Not what would you like to drink Miss. He clearly was Not being courteous to me by saying, what do you want I figured there was a language barrier so I said to him did you understand what I was trying to say to you sir The bartender said what do you want to drink I told him I will order a drink but I'd like to know if you understood what I was expressing to you I had made mention that the man was last to come to the counter the female was first I second and the man was last but you served him first. The bartender said so you don't want anything to drink I told him are we having difficulty understanding each other He said no I understand. So once he said he understood it clearly told me he purposely was rude and sexism played apart in his decision. I was going to go to the manager and let the manager know how disrespectful this person was so that he or she could look in the camera and see exactly what took place. I'm hoping that the camera footage is still available if management decides to make contact with me. The bartender was given my order and when he made my drink it was not tasteful. Regardless of his behavior I counteracted it with kindness I even gave a tip. He never said sorry he never apologized for his despicable Behavior. I experienced racism wow at this Resort it appears if you are Puerto Rican some Dominicans are not fond of you. This experience came about while going to the discotech that this Resort publicizes as a discotech they recommend. A staff member at the bar had the audacity to speak to a patron using the word n e g r o. The person is from Puerto Rico their skin color is dark and once he opened his mouth and spoke it was clear he was not from DR. Before speaking his girlfriend ordered the this Resort  is definitely not some place I would  recommend drinks where she is from Dr and everything was fine once the girlfriend left the bar to go to the restroom he ordered another drink something happened between those few seconds with the bartender and the patron as a result he was insulted and removed himself from the bar without the drinks. When his girlfriend came from the bathroom he had a very small discussion with her she wanted to approach the bar tender but he pulled her and they left out of the club. I just don't understand why people can't get along. I will not return to this Resort if it were only one staff member that was rude to me I might. But being harassed by the Bellboy to take my bags and even though telling him more than once no then being insulted and disrespected by the bartender and to hear such negativity from another bartender at the Disco more than enough for me not to return. I must admit the food was not all that too wish for. I would say the best meal was the Asian meal plan they had one night. The morning breakfast was a repeat the day before using the same products not necessarily the same food but the same thing they cook that day they cooked the day after which was a repeat it wasn't very much of a change if they added one or two things it didn't really make a big of a difference. The entertainment that they offered at the pool was not exciting. The music that they played at the club or though Spanish music Bachata salsa Merengue were all welcome what happened to RB pop and alternative music. The entertainment at night at the atrium was not very entertaining either. I just would not return I suggest anyone who decides to go here because the price looks good to really read over a few of the reviews because there's no reason for patrons to give a two or one star review because they're not being paid to do so. The action must have taken place. Best of luck. I have posted pictures one includes the disrespectful bartender"

Unfortunately, we did not share the same experiences other people had.I do want to talk about the positives as well. I was very happy with the bar  restaurant staff. They were so friendly and I was happy to tip them everytime they made a drink for us. I also really enjoyed the breakfast buffet. There were many things this hotel was lacking.1. The food options at this hotel are extremely limited, very unusual for an allinclusive hotel. There is a buffet, 2 asian restaurants open only for dinner, 1 mexican open only for lunch. Apparently there is a French restaurant as listed on their website, but numerous times when asked when the French restaurant will be open they responded tomorrow. This was never the case and I was informed they made french food in the buffet. 2. The room in the hotel is severely lacking. We stayed in the oceanfront suite. The were dust everywhere especially on the counter on top of our bed. The air condition also provided unbreathable air. I dont think the filters are changed regularly. We decided to turn off the air conditioning and had the balcony open most of the time when we were in the room. The fridge did not work as well. Out of the 7 days we stayed the fridge was restocked once. We had to call the front desk to restock our fridge each day. We also had to call several times to get more towels  toilet paper. I experienced poor service numerous times but we did our best to enjoy our time at the Melody Maker. This all changed when I faced racism. We decided to go on various tours and only had Friday  Saturday to enjoy the hotel services. Unfortunately, we were unable to find towels or an umbrella on Friday so we gave up and enjoyed our time inside the hotel.  We were committed to spending the day outside on Saturday but had an outrageous experience. I was in charge of finding a seat and umbrella and my boyfriend went on a mission to find towels. I found a seat and asked 3 different staff for an umbrella and they all said they were out. I would have been okay with this but I  noticed they were not out of umbrellas and  a lady maybe manager telling the staff members where to distribute the umbrellas. I went to her and asked for an umbrella and she told me she was out.  After I spoke with her 2 people went to her and were brought umbrellas immediately. I then saw her distributing 5 more umbrellas to guests. I then went to her again and she told me she was out of umbrellas. My boyfriend had been walking around for 30 minutes trying to find a towel. He eventually gave up and brought the towels in our hotel room we used earlier that morning. I explained the situation to my boyfriend and we concluded that maybe she was being racist towards me Asian Canadian. My boyfriend White Canadian asked me to stay where I was seating and sat alone a few seats away from me. He then asked for an umbrella and was brought an umbrella immediately. When I went to  join my boyfriend the lady noticed I was getting an umbrella and gave me a really dirty look. Unfortunately, racial discrimination is an everyday reality around the world but I should not encounter racism while I am on vacation. Looking back I regret not saying anything in that moment. Maybe if I had said something I would have enjoyed the last 2 days of my vacation..."

Although we encountered many disappointments during this bachelorette trip with this resort, the most offensive came at the very end of our trip. We were unfortunate victims of racism because we are African American. We were called Negras by the bartender in the main lobby bar, which we ignored at the time.... but then when we tried to get wine for our last night in the room with the bridetobe and went to the front desk to ask about burning a bottle for the room, we were completely ignored by the front desk receptionist, Isabella. Isabella never looked up from her desk, compl text ignored us, and was blatantly racist towards our group. At this point we asked for a manager and Alexis came out to assist. Alexis was helpful and we decided to report the deragotaory term used by his bartender with us that evening as we wanted him to know exactly what was going on at his hotel. As our friend explained to him what happened, Isabella began to laugh when we said that we were called negras, she laughed. She laughed at a deraogratory term used to refer to her guests at her resort. It was the ultimate slap in the face. We all were flabbergasted by her laughing and asked Alexis why she would laugh at something like that. We asked Isabella her last name and she pointed defiantly towards her name tag and said her name to us. We asked her why she would laugh at something so horrific that happened to guests at her hotel. Alexis then told her in Spanish to go into the back and she walked away. This was the most offensive, inappropriate, hateful treatment I have ever received at a resort. Further, this treatment is illegal and unlawful. We have booked 6 rooms and 12 people are here attending the bachelorette party. Alexis has told us that a report will be filed and it will be investigated. Once thats done I am more than happy to update this review. This is such an unfortunate experience. But my hope is that no one else would have to experience this kind of racism because of this warning."

On thursday I was called to confirm if I was still coming per my bookings which I did together with the time of arrival. Upon arrival on the friday the rooms weren't cleaned yet and was made to wait for more than 2 hrs. I was on my periods and by mistake messed on their bedding first night. Was fined 800 the following day and chucked out of the hotel for that. Even the cleaners confirmed that such accidents always happen but chasing us away was something else. The ladywhite manager was very rude and could see herself that her grounds for chasing us out were very weak and full of racism. We claimed the bedding we had been charged for and it was already washed with no stains to show that they are used to this. Because we went to a wedding at kuruman we left the hotel after day 1 to another hotel but was totally inconvenienced and offended by the treatment. I wouldn't advice anyone to go to that hotel as the same thing can happen to you. She even threatened to call the police, I was really waiting for her to do that because the table were going to turn to her due to her discrimination. I haven have proof of what they have done to us. If they have cameras I'm sure they'll also show how rude they were to us."

Unable to carry her bags herself, she asked if she could wait in the common room for her son to pick her up. Horrifically, the three white members of staff verbally abused and tried to diminish her for a full hour in front of guests until her son arrived, all over an apparent breach of the hostel's terms and conditions, which they later confirmed didn't even exist.  Such an ugly display of hate by young men and women who should know better.  This came a day after they kicked a black man out of his room so a young white woman could have his bed. I am appalled at how awfully this was all handled, especially when the manager did not even care what happened to the poor elderly lady.  I will never be coming back to this hostel again, and neither should you unless you support this kind of behaviour."

Granted, I was with 16 other Taiwanese people in an architecture tourist group, so certain amount of uncomfortable glances and rudeness was expected anywhere we go as we werent accustomed to their culture and ethics. At this point, if you still havent get where Im trying to get to in this delicate matter, then I will blatantly say that we are RACIALLY DISCRIMINATED. Personally, Ive travelled well enough all over the globe and to some, studied to recognize racism when I see one. First off, I think one or two people in my group decided to change rooms after the rooms didnt meet their standards general speaking, hygienic matter. The concierge reacted rude as they rolled her eyes and spoke god knows what in French. Secondly, when my friends and I went down to the lobby bar for a drink that night, we had to wait 45 mins until the bartender actually showed any interest in taking our orders. After taking the orders with a unbelievable attitude, as me and my friends were playing cards, the concierge earlier and the waiter argued in French, clearly about us but not directly. They specifically were arguing with each other and pointing at us and shouting les Chinois, in which, even if they didnt, anybody couldve tell by the body language they were displaying. Waiter later had no interest in taking our money, overall, it was just despicable. What came after was the worst. In the morning we were yelled and pointed into another private room even though the dining room only had a family eating there. At this point, I thought to myself that it was understandable since we have such a big group. HOWEVER, WHILE WE WERE EATING, WE DISCOVERED THAT THE HAM IN THE BREAKFAST BUFFET WAS ROTTEN. THEY HAD MOLD AND DISCOLORATION, ON PURPOSE OR NOT, THIS HAS CROSSED THE LINE AND WHEN ONE OF OUR MORE FLUENT FRENCH SPEAKER CONFRONTED THEM, THEY SHRUGGED AND SAID, WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT. Even though, the manager did come after waiting for another half an hour, she showed no remorse and spoke in a condescending tone. Now, I think in all perspective, I would have been less angry if the 4 starred Mercure didnt advocate their great professional service and their international known fame. It was disheartening and disappointing. I will not recommend ANYONE to visit because it left a bitter taste in my first impression of France."

Nightmare starts as soon as I reached Toulouse, Hotel le Clocher de Rodez around 2pm, we chose this hotel cause with an infant and older people we wanted to stay at city centre Raining and windy and cold. We were shocked Hotel has cancelled our paid booking, apparently they informed me by email me 6:30 pm evening before. I am travelling with a baby, senior citizen. It's raining and cold and windy, waiting to get into a room. Traveling by delayed trains thanks to French railway StrikeCompensation: they booked us in a another hotel, umbrella, to walk to the hotel. water to drink and promised to send our luggage to new hotel.How can you cancel our ""paid booking"" when you know we have a infant baby cot during booking she said some guests over stayed seriously. I asked the reception ""In this weather will you walk with your child and old people walk to another hotel this in a unknown city"" she said its common in France. ""Seriously"".I said why didn't you arrange atleast arrange taxi, because we are with senior and a child. where is the Manager, ""He is Busy"" A family with infant and senior, you cancelled the booking and Manager couldnt even appologies I said, I will share my review in websites.. ""Wi Sipuble""So we walk in Cold raining and windy condition. But it turned out quite far when there is  a infant, and 3 seniors. We reached 2nd hotel. New hotel won't mention the name Motel is a over statement, probably good for a day trip. She said our breakfast is free in Hotel le Clocher de Rodez, but then we have to go back to that hotel for Breakfast. We asked why cant u put us in a better hotel. She said you can save money with smaller hotel. You will get the balance of the money. This is where I felt clear racism since I come from Asia. I am sure if I was a European or of American Origin, they would think twice before cancel my booking, or even thinking of making me walk in such bad weather. Racism still exist in France. Asian Friends, becareful when you book Hotel le Clocher. if any online booking site keep Hotel le Clocher de Rodez in their portfolio, I guess they are encouraging such behavior to exist in this world."

I had probably all of the problems mentioned by other travellers with this hostel too, including a threatening attitude from an ""African guy"" who was also moving me to a room I did not want, I too asked my money back and left.Although once probably a lively and beautiful hostel it's a scruffy place now. Rooms are outdatedfurniture still from the fifties and are rather stuffy. This goes for the whole place... There's WiFi but it's slow and only works in certain areas. There is a breakfast but which reflects the miserliness of the hostel, don't expect too much. Staff is not present: I have waited in my two night stay for about two hours in total for the personnel to arrive. Last, it's far from the city centre.Whenever in Nice, and this has been a couple of times the last fifteen years I go to this hostel but this is the last time. I had a heated discussion with one of the cleaning ladies about her poking around in my stuff. She was very rude and just downright impossible, and the other staff pretty much followed. I was dumbfounded and I think in the end that racism was at play. They must have taken me for a Russian or Pole the French don't like those people very much.

Everything was impeccable and the amenities were wonderful.My only qualms were that sometimes service was odd  but other times, WONDERFUL. In particular, I had a situation where I was getting my luggage back and the hotel employee decided to ask ""if i was from asia"" and then gestured toward the eye area. While I understand that this was probably meant to be friendly, it is 2019 and that sort of behavior isn't acceptable to me as a guest of the hotel. The fact that one of the biggest topics of conversation on his mind was my race, and then to make that gesture just left a bad taste in my mouth, and I got no apology for it either. The other incident was that waitress at one of the restaurants was WAY too pushy about getting me to sign up for a OneHarmony hotel memberhsip account  I kept saying no around 45 times when I was in a hurry to pay my bill until the point where I felt like she must get commission or something for it. Other than those two incidents, the stay was pleasant and I found the rest of the staff delightful. There are just basic manners that some staff should probably be taught though, tbh."

Because, I have nothing bad to say about the hotel per se, as for rooms, cleanliness etc. I mean, this is a newly built hotel, located really pretty by the guest harbour, and it had fresh, clean rooms with comfortable beds. We stayed at the 4th floor and weren't bothered by noisy drunk locals, and were pretty satisfied  roomwise....But  here's what bugs me: I have never been as ignored from bartenders as I was at The Bishops Arms the hotel's pub/restaurant, and I have never suspected it to be because of my origins  until now! I don't carry Swedish features, but I am brought up in rnskldsvik, although I haven't lived there for many, many years now. On Friday evening, me and my boyfriend decided to have a beer before going to bed. It was around 10.30 pm, and the bar wasn't crowded, and what happened next was like from a movie cliche:You know, one walks into a bar, there are hardly any guest there  I think there were about two more guests standing around, waiting to get served yes, the patio was crowded, but the bar area was almost empty. Then, the new arrived guest waits, and waits, and waits. The three ! bartenders glancing at the new guest, but keep on ignoring. The other guest get their drinks, walks away, but the first one still waits. New guests arrive, get served before the first guest... And so on. Then, finally, I said to my boyfriend, ""let's split up and see what happens""  and, what do you know, five seconds later the bartenders came over and he could make an order!Next morning, at breakfast, I saw one of the bartenders were working as a breakfast host. And, when I asked him if they had any lactose free milk, he didn't look at me, didn't utter a word, just pointed at a spot where the milk carton was and walked away.So, if I had only the hotel rooms to review, I would say ""Great! Stay at this hotel with clean rooms and average breakfast."", but since Bishops Arms is part of the hotel and evidently they share service staff, I can only shake my head and say that I'm truly and utterly disappointed  and sad  that I have the notion of being subjected to racism in my old home town."

One of his colleagues then said, because I look Chinese and the floor manager still refused me at the table.Then I asked him: You are refusing me play here because I look Chinese, so this is racism and discriminationYour socalled manager couldnt properly deny my accusation.In short: I'm not being refused on grounds of being aggressive, disrespectful, rude or disturbing to anybody I'm being refused only based on my looks, not my nationality.

At first we thought it was a mistake, that the lady had mistaken us for another guest! But when she got in touch with her, she ratified what she had said and corroborated that we were thieves and dirty people, because, according to them, we stole a knife. We were very nervous because even if we had not borrowed anything in this hotel and the only meal we did there was breakfast! The day before we had gone to spend the day in Positano and had lunch and dinner there!

He advised us to file a civil suit against the hotel! We will go to the Brazilian consulate to look for information of was to proceed with the case is like to enter with some civil denunciation against the same since we suffered slander, defamation and we were victims of prejudice and racism! After that I contacted the hotel questioning what position they would take I had expected at least an apology and they never answered!When we booked the hotel we saw no bad review on the booking.com page, after entering the TripAdvisor page we saw that several guests had already had various problems with the owner / hotel manager !!BE CAREFUL AS THE NEXT VICTIM OF THEY CAN BE YOU"

I got the recommendation from a friend to be certified at Blue Ocean Dive Resort.  Nicki was so friendly and responsive over email that I became even more excited about my trip.With all of the great reviews and recommendations, you can imagine how surprised I was when management was blatantly unprofessional and disrespectful towards the staff. Being American and having traveled around southern Africa I am well aware of the racial tension but this was the first tourist spot that made no effort to even hide it. I am not sure weather they are not concerned with attracting international/forward thinking travelers the place is BURSTING with regulars decked out in Blue Ocean Dive sweat shirts or it is just a result of no one calling them on it, but I was very uncomfortable on multiple occasions. Race aside, there should be no reason why costumers hear you screaming at  your staff because  there is no food and another boat is coming in! or how  absolutely ridiculous  it is that breakfast is not out yet or any of the other frustrations that should be kept behind closed doors multiple times. Even after I told my dive instructor that it was fine and I was happy with toast he responded that that was not the point  and remained agitated, giving the start of our lesson bad energy. This experience was later followed by a rant from said instructor prefaced by Not to be racist in anyway! about how apartheid was good.   I was willing to let all of this slide so to speak until I was sitting at the bar at the same time many of the black staff were and the owner came over and jokingly asked Is this an illegal gathering All of these blacks sitting here. Back in the day you all wouldve been arrested. It made me sick to my stomach to listen to the staff laugh reluctantly.  Management was so kind to me that I began to feel I was getting my first taste of the phony treatment money can buy you. It is unfortunate because the younger guys, dive masters, skippers, kitchen staff and the actual diving are cool; but in this case a few rotten apples does spoil the barrel. If you are not okay with racist remarks and public displays of stress and frustration I would HIGHLY recommend you check into one of the other dive centers in the area. If racism and unprofessionalism do not bother you, then perhaps the absence of curtains thankfully had a large blanket in my luggage to cover my window forever flushing toilet, dampness from the half walled in bathroom or the unfilled promise of cheesecake will. I had trouble equalizing and was all for just diving shallow and exploring but I became so offended and fed up that I decided to get out asap! The silver lining is that this sleepy beach town is not to far from the city so it was easy to book somewhere else and change my plans."

As I was traveling, I couldn't hear the lady on the phone and mistook Manilal a Sinhala name for Mariyadas a Tamil name, so I spoke to him in Tamil assuming he was a local. But when I said ""Vanakkam"" greeting in Tamil, the Manager shouted ""Speak in Sinhala! This is Sri Lanka! Speak in Sinhala or English, I don't know Tamil!"".It was rather unfortunate that we were on a field trip to the North and East and the Palmyrah House was our first stop. The visitors remarked at the rather evident racism.I couldn't bear to speak to the Manager when we arrived, though he was bent over double and almost servile when greeting the international visitors.I was too upset to bring up the matter, and he also didn't apologize.I later heard him berating the two Tamil speaking boys who brought our bags up, in English. Which was rather ironic.They seemed to pick up on my discomfort and asked if I had called earlier.Given the rash of military owned and run hotels and resorts in the North and East, it would be interesting to know the story of Palmyrah House and it's supposedly ""Sri Lankan"" Manager who not only doesn't seem to know one of the local languages of his country, but also is rude to anyone else who speaks it.Rather an unpleasant stay."

The rest of the staff were equally friendly and helpful, as well as being wonderfully efficient. The rooms were spotless and nicely equipped, pretty much exactly as described in the information blurb on the website. I'm sorry Henry R, but nowhere on the website could I find reference to aircon and the ceiling fans were no more noisy that any others I have come across anywhere else  maybe you should actually go to the trouble of reading up on the places you choose to book at The reserve itself is absolutely beautiful! Pristine, unspoiled bushveld in a flat valley set between two ridges in the Waterberg. Game numbers seem to me to be about what I would expect to be appropriate to a well managed ecosystem  plenty to see, but not to the point of numbers that would result in overgrazing. Despite this, Johan informed me that it is generally necessary to augment feed for about three months of the year. I'm writing this sitting on the veranda outside our chalet watching half a dozen blue wildebeest, a dozen or so zebra, a small herd of impala and a sounder of warthog  all with their young  grazing less that 200m from where I'm sitting. Henry R, perhaps you are confusing a zoo with a game reserve The game drives up to the plateau on the top of one of the ridges were very enjoyable and pretty much what we have come to expect  sometimes seeing a wide variety of game and other times not much at all. However, even when there is not much game to see, the differing vegetation in different areas of this small area is amazing and there is abundant bird life. Johan might not be the most chatty of of guides, but regularly pointed out interesting things on the drive, including stopping to pick ""stamvrug"" wild milk plums for those of us who hadn't tasted them before to sample, picking fronds of Boekenhoudboom wild beech tree seeds for those who wished to attempt to germinate them at home, venturing off road to get us closer to the eland and zebra herds and accompanying us all to view and discuss a pelvis and spine with attached skin spotted next to the road  in the absence of a skull, he eventually concluded that it was the remains of a particularly large brown hyena. He was clearly very knowledgeable and quite willing to answer questions in detail, being fluent in both English and Afrikaans one of our party is a Brit. Monique717, I can fully understand your disappointment at your picnic being washed out, but on our arrival Jen very clearly explained to us that picnics are only available during off peak times when the lodge is quiet enough to enable them to arrange them almost lucky you  we wanted to arrange a picnic too, but couldn't due to the lodge being fully booked, and that game drives were undertaken three times a day on a strictly firstcome, firstserved basis. I further understand that he people you saw going on a game drive after you were informed that no further game drives were going to take place that day was in fact the owner of the game reserve. Whilst I can fully understand your disappointment, I guess the owner is entitled to go on a game drive whenever he wishes toFrom what I could see, the walking trails on the reserve are clearly marked and vary from easy 2 or 4 km rambles, to hikes up into the ridges for the more adventurous  we were advised against trying these due to a couple of very active leopard in the vicinity Jen explained to us that they very definitely prefer not to  lose guests to the leopards : . Being somewhat lazy, we stuck to the easier rambles, which we thoroughly enjoyed  because no hunting is allowed on the reserve, the animals are very relaxed and do not startle easily, allowing one to approach to within 50  100m before they move off. I was somewhat intrigued by Henry R's vitriolic criticism, given that this flew directly in the face of our experience and therefore decided to explore some of his criticisms. The chalet next to the septic tank he complained about did not smell at all of sewage and the group staying in the chalet confirmed that they have previously booked the chalet and have never experienced this to be a problem. On enquiry, Johan confirmed that the sewage line from the chalet to the septic tank did block whilst Henry R and his group were staying there, entirely due to the group flushing sanitary pads, tampons and condoms down the toilet, in direct contravention of the standard request in the bathroom not to do so.As far as the complaint related to having to pay extra for extra guests staying in a chalet specifically designated to sleep a specific number of guests is concerned ... really REALLY Tell me Henry R, do German lodges I understand that you are German, allow guests to stuff as many extra guests as they want to into their chalets that are advertised to sleep two only, without extra chargeThen onto the complaints of racism. There happened to be two separate black families staying at the game reserve at the time we were there. Both families were visibly surprised when I described Henry R's accusations of racism against management to them. One of guys I spoke to spontaneously responded ""there must be something wrong with that guy!"". On enquiry, I was informed that the unpleasantness appeared to have started after one of Henry R's party, who happened not to be white, seriously damaged the hoisting mechanism of the rather expensive umbrellas at the swimming pool, apparently due to not understanding how the mechanism worked. Reportedly when Henry R, as the head of the group, was requested to please ensure that his party did not do any more damage, but rather request assistance, he took serious umbrage and publicly and vociferously accused Johan of racism. Justified The black families I spoke to did not appear to think so. Some people, it appears, are just impossible to please!In conclusion, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, find little or no merit in the complaints posted and would happily recommend Olievenfontein as an amazing venue for those seeking peace and quiet!"

Bad service and racism included.","We went here with a group of 10 adults and stayed in different cottages. We did not enjoy our stay at all for the following reasons:  Eventough the hole complex is very nice and we'll looked after, the cottages themselves are only on a very basic level: No airconditioning only big fans, which are very noisy, tiny rooms, small TV. Apart from that, no bar or shop facility is provided. Moreover, one cottage was placed directly near to the septic tank  the smell was very unpleasant.  This would have been alright if not the pricing would not be so unfair and in our case just excessive. As I said, we stayed in different cottages: Although we were told that every client hat to pay the same amount, for the people of our group it differed between 1100 Rand and 650 Rand per person and night. Although the cottage of the other groupmembers was much nicer, we had to pay most. Furthermore, we booked the hole cottage on Booking.com  and then we're forced to pay 50 more for a third person. This is just ridiculous; we felt ripped off. At the end, we payed 13.200 Rand for 3 person for 4 nights in a basic selfcatering cottage  this was the maximum we had to pay in 2 weeks travel through Southafrica and we stay only in very upmarket and luxurious places. When we complained about this, we got a very harsh answer from the management.  We ordered breakfast for the first day. Again, very expensive  and just bad. When we asked for a fried egg, we were told in an inappropriate way that we had to accept what was offered and our wishes would not be heard.  Some members of our groups were black. Twice, the manager made racist comments  an absolute nogo. They did not feel welcome.  The game reserve does not have too many animals. Therefore, the ""game""drive was quite boring. Also, the manager seemed not motivated and made no comments at all on the drive.  While the black travelgroup members were told, that it was a quiet place and they had to calm down, no such comment was made to a big group with several wild kids  chilling at the pool therefore got embarrassing."

The fresh fruit juices blended with mint are heavenly, all servings are generous and really cheap! Note though that they only allow people who are staying at the hotel to enjoy the restaurant, so you can't share these treats with friends who may be staying elsewhere.The woman who offers tourism advice in the foyer is lovely, there is a swimming pool and although the rooms are basic they are clean and have a balcony and it all comes at a very low price tag. All these things are great. Me and my friend were however treated with arrogance and INCREDIBLE rudeness, in its worst form, by the man in the reception who is there every day, from the moment we arrived at the hotel until we left. He made us feel really small and VERY unwelcome! I wish we had reacted with anger and that we had just left the place but we were so stunned at the way he treated us and questioned us and were also too tired to start looking for another place. We were also asked if we were staying there, EVERY time we had food in the restaurant. We were the only ones they asked and were the only ones with more exotic looks. I am Swedish Half Indonesian/Half Swedish and my friend is French born in Madagascar and we are short and brown.  We are nice and friendly and dress ""properly"" and really didn't do anything to warrant the reception man's behavior towards us. The girls in the restaurant were just doing what they have been asked to do but it was actually still really hurtful. You don't want to be faced with racism on your holiday.

We have lived at many different hotels/hostels during these three months and have barely had a problem. Unfortunately this changed yesterday.So, we left some clothes for laundry at the reception of the hotel and when we got it back I noticed that my tshirt was completely discolored and the colour had loosened from it. I was, naturally, very sad so I went back to the reception in hope that something could be done to compensate me. I never thought I was going to get a full refund, but at least something since it was an expensive tshirt from Italy some might say it's stupid to bring such a shirt on this kind of travel, but how could I possibly predict that something like this would happen. Since I have been working with service myself I'm well aware that sometimes you have to deal with overly rude customers/guests. So I started the conversation politly and simply asked for help but I was met by an aggressive receptionist who was really rude. He was telling me that I was lying to get money and that I was wrong !!. He told me that it looked exactly like it did when I left it there, something he wouldn't know since I left it to a girl in the reception and not him. Also, they don't do the laundry theirselves. They leave it to another laundry service somewhere close to the hotel.But this isn't the worst part, the receptionist was openly racist towards me. He said things like ""you're a foreigner, not a local, you come and make trouble"" and now i'm qouting ""Don't come to vietnam. He accused me of lying so I could ""steal"" money from them!!I was left speachless, I had started the conversation nice and gentle and made it clear I didn't want to fight over a tshirt but obviously, something had to be done.I was met with open racism and accusations of lying. Even threatening me to call the police if I wouldn't get back to my room.I understand that sometimes tourist behave bad when they're out traveling, but that does not justify such a behaviour from the staff. I'm always nice since I know how frustrating it can be to stand on the other side of the story.I have sent an email to the hotel hoping that it will reach the person in charge so it wont happen anyone again."

We needed two rooms : one for my friend and me, and one for our local guide from Petra.At the beginning, a woman took care of us at the lobby, saying that two rooms were available. Then, the manager arrived  while we were paying, but suddenly told us that there was only one room left for the two tourists, but that the guide had to go somewhere else !! ""No room for Arabs"" he said !!! We just had the exact same experience with the Mosaic Hotel a few minutes ago !!This was an unacceptable experience !! We had to try a third hotel, and again, our guide wasn't accepted ! I don't know if this way of managing a hotel is typical of Madaba, but to me, it was really a bitter experience. I strongly recommend not to go to Mosaic Hotel or Black Iris Hotel."

The staff were rude and unhelpful, the manager was not just actively unhelpful but deliberately rude and racist against several of our party. The accommodation was poor and overcharged. Our whole experience was not just poor but actively dreadful. Additionally, there was open racism against black people and Japanese. One of our party was from Kenya and was called an animal by the staff, whilst another Japanese friend was almost attacked by the manager and was told that while the whites would be welcome, Japanese and Africans were not. All in all, this is a nasty place run by actively racist people and we would strongly recommend it is avoided. After one day we found a nice place in Ciqikou and moved out. We will never return and especially for black, Japanese, or anyone who finds this type of racism abhorrent, avoid."

Very rude hotel manager. Food is ok but nothing special.

I did not expect to find it in Colombia and frankly was shocked to find it in spades at this hotel. The night manager was about as openly racist as anyone I have met in my life. As a white American visiting with a dark skinned friend, I feel a need to stand up for him and anyone else who is subject to such hideous behavior. It was downright insulting. As a result I, in good faith, could never recommend this place to anyone.  I also felt like it was a bit of a tourist trap. Yes, the room is fine. The beds are fine. Breakfast was decent but it's very over priced for what you get. You pay for the location, but there are many other wonderful areas to visit in Medellin. And for a hotel that caters to tourists, particularly Americans many of the guests were Americans, they don't have even one person on staff who speaks any English. I speak Spanish so it isn't a problem for me, but for my friend, it was disconcerting. My personal advice Keep on moving. You can find a million places better than this one."

I believed that is the hospitality of Rajasthan, before I came to Harasar Haveli. Here in greeted by a shout and threat. There's a young staff named Saroj, who thinks he has the right to shout at and threat guests. Reason: I had booked a deluxe room 4 months back; but since I came from Jaisalmer, I came in the evening and I was given the most horrible room, at the back of ground floor. And I had requested to change the room. But, according to them, they are fully booked. So the staff shouted at me and threatened me. The room was so bad and poorly ventilated, that it looks like a cave even in broad daylight. One side windows open to the dining room, which definitely can never be opened. We still agreed to stay in the room. But, as soon as I entered the toilet, I saw strands of hair lying on the floor. The bath place was extremely dirty. I again went to the reception and requested them to change the room, but to deaf ears. They were so busy then chatting with foreigners. This is a place in India, where foreigners are given A class treatment and Indians receive horrible treatment. One staff came to check my toilet, picked up the hair and left. We stayed in the room for the next 45 mins, but no one came to clean the toilet.This place is the perfect example, where a wonderful building can be made a horrible experience just by rudeness and racist behaviour of the staff. I feel sorry for the owners. And warn all my fellow Indians to stay away from this place.Never believed Rajasthan hospitality can be this bad, before I experienced it myself."

I liked the hotel because it was clean and beautiful. But the good things end here. The hotel staff is RUDE. They cater ONLY to foreigners so if you are an Indian get ready to taste racism in your very own country. Not only this, the staff accuses you of lying even when it is their fault. I do not think they know how to run a hotel.The last night, we had a train to catch. When we went for dinner, we asked the waiter how long will it take. He said 1015 minutes. We also requested him that we have a train to catch and if he can hurry this up. We waited for 35 minutes and there was no food so we decided to cancel the order and go to the train station. We informed the night manager and instead of rebuking his own staff he started shouting at us the guests!!. Had to threaten him that I am from the press to get him to shut up. NIGHTMARE!!I must admit though that the owner and his wife were rather courteous and they do not know of this incident where the staff was so rude to my colleague and me. But all the same. Go here only if you are a foreigner, otherwise risk it."

He said the first night he only had a small room available, we should stay there the first night and tell him the next day what wed like to pay for it and if its too small we would be able to change the next day. So all seemed well, except the room was tiny and featured cigarette butts from the last guest. The next morning I went to see him to sort the price and fix the next night as well. When I saw the son the next morning his attitude towards me had changed. When I asked what he wanted for the small room he said 700 rupee,  a ridiculous rippoff  I paid 600 rupee for a much better room last year!I asked my friend to join the discussion, he came and the guesthouse owner father also turned up, in dark mood. What followed was racism and discrimination of the lowest kind. Amongst other things he told my friend that if he would be seen with me in public the police would arrest him. This incident truly shocked me. It was disgraceful, disrespectful, threatening discrimination by the guesthouse owner. We had done nothing wrong, we were respectful, quiet, clean, paying guests. It was simply my friends Indian origin that seemed to get up this guesthouse owners nose and he let us know that he was displeased by seeing a western woman befriended with an Indian man. A hotel owner should be able to leave discrimination aside. He should be able to keep his own moral convictions to himself and not openly attack his guests with verbal aggressiveness. I have now spent more than 14 months travelling in India and never encountered anything like this. Im deeply shaken by the racism we suffered at the Discovery Guesthouse."

My first encounter was at the Indigo Bar, We only ordered three Grapetisers, I was the first customer there but I was served after three white partrons clearly we had to change my skin color to be recognized and this happened again the next day when we needed lunch,  we were served late irregardless that the place empty. We had a Honeymoon Candlelight Dinner as part of our package, I am appalled by that dinner after being under lights and not even a single candle in sight the food was pathetic to say the least. We had to eat because there is not much options, it wasnt special at all, we were even tempted to go to the normal buffet The next encounter of sutle racism was on Wednesday night, guests were invited for a  Cocktail meeting with Management, practically observed the management team that actually came to talk to us. Only the Spa Manager came to us and she made an effort to chat to other guests the rest of the manager didnt bother to come to us they just to other white guests and amongst themselves. Im a frequent traveler, traveled various countries and various hotels thought this would be a good honeymoon experience but the service at this hotel is not that great at all. What I can say is good is the rooms and the sea view only but when it comes to food and service this hotel would barely hold a 3 star rating.So if you are of color avoid this hotel by all means you would be ignored. The worst part is that I am still a guest but Im really counting the days I check out because of the experience.Regards Sabelo"

To be treated with such disrespect and clear prejudice by the manager and his wife/partner was just awful. One of my consultants watch was stolen from his room and we waited for the manager who just did not come to speak to us, more prejudice. My other consultants room could not open and the manager would not assist and when we came home in the evening he could not get back into his room, the manager came back and provided the key to the room that he had locked up in his office, more racism and prejudice. Pathetic.I will never recommend this hotel and never stay here again. NEVER."

I booked several rooms here for 4 nights for my organization, which consists of myself and my wife, my partner and his fiance, and our Filipino employees. I am white, and my partner is Asian.We had MANY incidents of racism. My partner experienced it himself when he went to bring drinks to the beach where we were having a meeting and was told he couldn't bring them, and after some back and forth was allowed to, after the worker said, ""Oh, I thought you were Filipino"". He was also told he wasn't allowed on the beach after 6pm when everyone else is allowed there. This was told to him when he wanted to bring some glasses onto the beach. My employees received similar treatment, being told they could not do things that I was doing, such as moving some chairs so we could sit together as a group. One employee went to the spa and was ignored by the attendant. The second time she went in, it was at the same time as a group of Korean women, and then she was handed a towel. There were several incidents like this.In addition, I should note that one of my employees tripped and sprained her ankle when walking down to the beach. She went to the onsite clinic and was told to take an antiinflammatory. She is a trained nurse, and she knows that it wasn't handled properly. I had to go back to the clinic with her to get them to wrap a tensor bandage on her. So if you stay here, don't rely on their illtrained ""nurse"".We made a formal complaint about these issues to the hotel. They pretended to take us seriously and said they would investigate. They didn't. I received an email that denied any racism had taken place, and they ""basically had a briefing with all our team members and stress the importance on treating each and every guest equally. I can tell you that our team members doesnt have any preferential treatment to specific guest in the resort."" When we met with the management, one of the people told us privately that yes, Filipinos are racist against other Filipinos in situations like this. So not only did hotel deny that anything happened, they lied about the attitude of their employees. I spend over 12,000 at the ShangriLa Mactan to reward my employees for their hard work. The ShangriLa Mactan punished my employees for their reward. Shame on this resort!"

I was insulted threatened by Mr. Manager Kadir , I was told to keep silent that I say the same thing anyway and we were threatened by Mr. Kadir that our whole group of 14 people would live the hotel if he wanted, he even asked us for the room number and told us to go get our luggage, but  on the way to the rooms , he  changed his  minds and tell us that we need it to do it anymore . I ask him what is his name cause I wanted to report this conflict to the director of the hotel , but he refused to tell me his whole name . my opinion is that a manager has to settle a conflict and not step up it. I am extremely disappointed with the racism and unprofessionaly  that Mr Manager Kadir has shown."

However, the brand new Hotel, with an international brand like the Marriot, sure sounded initially the next Number 1, especially with the low prices, which are in place to beat the competition.But, it turned out 8 days of hell, I prefer the slightly older Transamerica, where it might not be so beautiful and new, however, they know how to run a hotel smoothly.The one with the booming mega phone:My first room change was when I realized that one side of the Hotel is faced towards the main street of Avenida Engenheiro Domingos Ferreira. During the work hours there is constant loud noise from a mega phone that is set on automatic, constantly hammering sales messages, it keeps on repeating itself again and again for hours on end, day in day out, enough to drive you totally crazy!The day of floods:The second room change occurred when the hotel was seriously affected by the heavy rains, the hotels restaurant and ground floor became waterlogged, the gym was closed and the rooms on the 9th floor, where I happened to be have all become waterlogged, due to the rains. Obviously, something is seriously wrong, when it rains inside the 9th floor of your 45 star hotel room, see pics. Taking into account that this is a new building, its not hard to guess that there are some serious structural problems, that they have to cope with.The day of heat:Recife, not only had heavy rains, it had some seriously stifling hot weather too and the air conditioning system was suddenly out of service for an entire day. The room temperatures reached a colossal 35 degrees, slightly hard to do anything in such heat. After some begging I got a fan from Cris front desk, who tried against all odds to be as helpful as possible, she also offered compensation, free breakfast, which was nice. The fan alleviated the situation somewhat, but eventually, I actually had to leave the hotel for a few hours and come back at night. There were more air conditioning problems throughout our stay, the thermostats often didnt seem to work in the lobby and restaurant areas, where it got really cold to a degree where everyone was shivering. In the room too, the only way the thermostat actually worked was if you put the air con on auto mode, but if you set the temperature at low or high it will go below the temperature you set. I often set it at 24, but it went down to 19, unless I set the fan at auto. The hotel staff explained to me, that this is how it works, and only in this manner.The cold showers day:One day we woke up to a no hot water day, after many hours of maintenance work, we were advised that the hot water has finally returned. I was excited for just about one minute, as a shower in the simmering hot Recife, would have been pretty nice, but no, the water coming out of the taps looked like piss water, totally yellow, see pics. We were assured that the yellow waters, that look like its coming from a nuclear reactor, will disappear after a while, however, we actually wanted to disappear even faster than the off putting water color.The forgetful cook:Caio, is the nice guy who prepares omelettes on the spot at breakfast time, actually, it would have been a great service if we were not to take into account that he actually forgot to make my order twice. On two separate occasions he simply took an order and just totally forgot to prepare it. Maybe someone with a better memory, would be more suited for the job, not to mention his general demeanour which was all a bit haphazardly. You never knew if he understood you or not, mumbling under his breath some intangible words, which often left you more baffled than before he opened his mouth.The restaurant actually serves good food and is a fab facility and is quite a good substitute to the room service/mini bar, which they dont have. However, you have to eat there under freezing conditions, due to the air condition thermostat failing, and the wait time for food to arrive is terribly long, but the food is good, especially if you have an hour or two to killLousy Housekeeping:Rooms dont get cleaned automatically, we had to constantly bug them to come and clean the room, change towels, etc, as if it was some favour they do, nothing seemed to run smoothly in this place.Bad maintenance:Lights in the lifts were broken for a few days, all but one single bulb which was working. What hotel leaves all their lifts with one small light, as if you are in a lift to a prison cell, for god sake, who runs this place, how simple is it to change a blooming light bulbOn top of that the lifts are badly designed, you have to call each lift separately and there is no centralized system which coordinates all the lifts. Here some clever designer, made it in a way that you have to decide which lift is best for you and call it, or press on each lift separately to call them all and see which is the quickest, totally and utterly ridicules. On top of that the lifts to the car park, really look like they have never been prepared for proper public use, see pic. It is unbelievable that a hotel of this calibre have these kind of lifts to their car park. Yeah, they have some excuse, that the car park even though part and parcel of the hotel building is run by an external firm, however, that is a weak and unacceptable excuse!!Bad Management:I had two bookings, one for a the first few days and then for more days, they closed my first booking, took the liberty and charged my credit card without even giving me a breakdown of charges or telling me for that matter, only after I asked for it, they said, ohh it was taken off your card. How nice, which hotel charges your credit card without giving you before a breakdown of charges, thats kinda basic, I would have thought.Racism in the Marriot:I came in with my girlfriend one evening and we were basically verbally attacked by the reception desk girl Kylyandra. She kinda yelled across rudely to us, as we were walking past, trying to find out, if my girlfriend is registered, showing that she is suspicious that I am bringing in a hooker into the hotel. This is after staying in the hotel with my girlfriend for an entire week, I initially arrived with her to the hotel when I first arrived and her name was registered on the booking from the first minute. I responded, well, check on your system and you will see shes registered and we walked right on to the lift. When we arrived to the lift, we were surprised to see that she chased us all the way down the corridor and demanded yet again to know, if shes registered. At this point, I got really angry with her, and I reminded her, that less than 60 seconds ago, when we walked past the reception desk she demanded the same information, yet what the hell is she doing chasing us to the lifts, with the exact same question. I said to her, you dont believe my previous answer, I think, I told you loud and clear, she is registered, go check on your system. I tried to understand what was not clear in my previous answer, I asked her to explain to me, what was not understood in my previous response, she had absolutely nothing to say for herself, no explanation or an apology and just went back to her place without uttering a single word.However, instead of receiving an apology, which would be kind of minimal, 5 minutes later we got a hotel staff member knocking on our door, together with none less than an armed security guard. I must stress, I have been travelling for nearly 3 years in Brazil, sleeping most nights in various hotels, never ever in my entire life has a security guard knocked on my door in a hotel room. They were demanding that we changed rooms still this same evening, since the day before the water was raining in to the room, due bad infrastructure of the hotel see above. Whilst it had dried up already and after a long day and evening out, we wanted just to go to sleep and see to it in the morning as there was nothing pressing at this moment in the evening, we didnt fancy packing up all our stuff so late in the evening. However, they insisted that we move rooms there and then. That was ordered by Kylyandra who was not too happy with my rightfully angry respond to her suspicions that my girlfriend is none other than a working girl.I walked in to this same hotel with a friend of mine, a white girl a good few times during my stay and she was not registered with the hotel and not a single word was ever uttered, no questions asked whatsoever. However, since my girlfriend is not white, the whole demeanour and attitude was as if shes some working girl, who needs to prove who she is before she can enter, whilst she was actually registered from day one. Clear and open racism which is not uncommon in Brazil, especially in these types of establishments, however I do except an international brand to have clear cut guidelines of who has the right to questions the identification of people who enter the hotel, and most importantly, guidelines as to when to be questioning peoples identities that apply to all and does not depend on the whim of some racist receptionist with a bias towards none whites."

Last year we invited two Indian! friends to Goa. We went to ""Sevas"" to book a bungalow for them. We were shown a quite nice, clean bungalow near the reception. We booked it for two nights and paid it in advance. When we arrived with our friends, the manager seemed to be unpleased because he obviously doesn't want Indian people in his resort. He put the two guys in a shabby hut in the farthest, darkest corner of the resort, just beside a building site with awful building noise during the whole day, pretending there were no other rooms free which was a lie, although we had already paid for a much nicer room. We felt betrayed, ashamed and were shocked about this racism.The Sevas calls itself an ""eccofriendly habitat"" ,which is completely ridiculous. They throw all their rubbish  plastic bags, bottles, rotten vegetables and so on just behind their bungalows  a huge stinking landfill which attracts vermin, even though there exists the possibility to have the garbage transported and disposed of  against a fee of course. Somtimes they burn it. Can you imagine how burning plastic stinks For days on end toxic clouds of smoke pollute the air of the surrounding resorts with their foul smell. The "" eccofriendly"" label is just a marketing trick and has nothing to do with reality.Don't waste your money at this unsympathetic place. There are a wide range of other lodgings in Palolem or Patnem."

They also did feel the need to tell me that the other guest staying there was ""African but we know him very well,"" so the racism allegations seem justified. But he the other guest seemed very happy regardless. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Mthatha but this was slightly outside my budget at R700 a night so probably won't stay there again. "

The Villas were absolutely amazing and i was always comfortable. The facilities were neat and tidy. i Was a bit shocked that you had to pay to use the Jacuzzi bubbles, but hey, i guess money making can be done anywhere using anything. one thing that was a bit uneasy is the presence of racism. The atmosphere of judgmental attitudes and rudeness was certainly felt through our stay over the weekend. But myself being a bornfree it didn't really get to me, i enjoyed myself in the light of peoples racist view on life.

I mean, do I sleep in a different style My advice is simple  avoid this hotel!As I recall from previous spring 2016 stay is the hotel beaten up, breakfast very poor which is included and a noisy hotel.

In short, I found the food to be delicious, and the staff to be lovely. But I felt the lodge had an owner that was unpleasant at best and the lodge to have an uncomfortable feeling of racism. Some of the other guests we spoke with felt it, too. Our guide was seated separately from us, despite our asking multiple times if he could be seated with us. Once, we were told he had left, though we found out later he was there, but they had put him in the back room where the staff and guides eat. At dinner, he was seated with the other guides and staff at a table to the side, even though we had specifically asked to be seated with him. He told us that the same thing has happened to him at that hotel before.The room also had no phone, and the front desk shut down at some point during the night. We narrowly avoided a disaster when we arrived back late and no one was at the front desk, though they had our key locked inside. Luckily, we were able to track down someone in the kitchen cleaning up, but I'm not sure what we would have done otherwise.I would not stay here again, nor would I recommend it. Which is unfortunate, because the staff is really lovely, and the grounds are quite nice though, as pointed out by another review, not particularly close to the crater."

This gentleman in a joking fashion asked if I spoke Japanese, I replied no. He then proceeded to ask my partner. When she also replied no the gentleman pressed the issue further by approaching her repeating his question only this time using his hands to squint horizontally both his eyes. My partner is not Japanese but is from an Asian country. Needless to say we left and I spent the rest of the night consoling my extremely distraught partner. I feel I should have done more at the time but unfortunately I didn't. Hotel staff should be trained better especially considering the different ethnicities coming to stay here."

The food we got was wrong and late on several occasions and we kept being asked if we were 'still' going to continue staying there.The only logical reason we could think of was probably racism as our skin is not white.They did not clean our rooms for the first 2 days and despite few reminders on the 3rd day, I had to find the cleaning lady myself and tell her about it after which she reluctantly cleaned it."

We were lied to in an attempt to prevent us from staying there. My boyfriend and I are an interracial couple. I am African my boyfriend is Mexican and French. We arrived to the inn in the a.m. hours, tired from our long road trip.The blonde woman who assisted us at the front desk, Kory, told us that the cabin we rented online was not available. From the beginning, she looked disgusted and gave off a weird, distant vibe to both of us. As she feigned attempting to search for rooms on her computer multiple times, she kept lying  repeating that nothing was available at their inn for us. And that we would have to sleep somewhere else. My boyfriend had never had a problem like that, so he called hotel.com's customer service. After a while of telling a hotel.com employee that we could not stay there, a room was magically made available, lol. She put us in that room  not a cabin, like we had originally booked  that she knew for sure had a front door that did not lock, and had been out of service for months. It was scary sleeping there. We put a chair by the handle and went to sleep. The next morning, we found out through talking to house keepers that many rooms in the inn were available, and the room we stayed at isn't supposed to be given to customers  Racist Kory and the rest of the staff are aware of that. They also agreed with us that she is without a doubt racist and provides horrible service. They have complained before but nothing has been done. Its 2018, why has this known racist woman, Kory, not been fired yet We were made to feel like dirt. I've never been the victim of such a dirty, dehumanizing act of racism. She is referred to as Kory with a dog there."

They are rude, unprofessional, and discriminate against their customers. I will be filing a complaint. I was ridiculed for smoking behind the hotel but, other customers smoked on the balconies and whatnot without receiving a hard time from the staff. I then was accused of smoking in my room because of the smell of my clothes which was outrageous as well since I have stayed here numerous times and never had an issue. My checkin was troublesome, employees not wanting to let me use my points for my reservation. The overall experience was horrendous, I will never stay at this establishment again and management needs to either make staff changes or be eliminated entirely. If I wasn't a young professional, those staff members would have gotten a mouthful. Oh and housekeeping needs to do their job and not worry about what people are doing in their spare time that are paying guests!"

It's certainly not discouraged by the staff and management. One goes to hot springs, in general, to relax and unwind. My experience was a disaster. Another patron in the men's locker room became loud, rude, offensive, and escalated to racebased threats claiming I ""raped and murdered his people,"" and that his people and the animals were going to wipe me out. It didn't stop there. I chose to walk away. He was looking for a fight. I didn't give him the opportunity. As it turns out, his threats did not end my horrible experience.I left and went straight to the front desk. The offensive patron was not removed.  However, management did take swift action  they cut my wristband which is used to regain entrance the same day. You see, if they give me a free pass a refund they feel I should not come back that day. I didn't end up getting that free pass. Do not expect management to manage threatening situations  at all, in fact. They're more concerned about ensuring you don't come back. In truth all that kept me coming back was convenience. I'm a local. And I have friends. And they do too! Violent racism in these days, whether physical or verbal, should not be dismissed so quickly so as to ensure that you comply with some ridiculous policy and further offend your customer just to make a buck. I'm disgusted not only by the facility, which has had some recent bandaid work completed, but by the poor management as well.This is not the place to bring friends or family from out of town."

But, there is no staff or lobby. You book privately with condo owners. While there for a week, we had 2 overnight fire alarms that we guess were false alarms because no one told us anything and there simply was no one to ask. One was at 2:303:00 AM, the other around 11 pm. Kind of scary considering we weren't familiar with the facility. This is an old facility, dated. We aren't very familiar with Daytona, but it seemed in a rough part of town with alot of the cheap 35/day hotels directly across from it. The people roaming around those areas didn't seem to be tourists at all but residing in those hotels. There is also public beach access and parking directly on one side of the condo. If you are unlucky enough to have a window on that side, you will hear anyone and everyone who pulls in there overnight. The pool was out of service for 2 days, we didn't know about this in advance. Very sad to report that our African American son experienced some racism from what I assume was another condo owner in addition to a security guard. We are a Caucasian family, but we have an AA son. The first night, as soon as we arrived, our AA son went down to the pool. My husband, myself and our younger son went down after we unpacked. He was just sitting in a pool chair with headphones listening to his mp3 player. We walked past him and were standing by the gate to go to the beach. A short while later, the security guard came to question him and ask him to leave. Interesting enough, he never said anything to us about leaving. The guard told him no one was to be in the pool area after 8pm. The rules posted did say the pool closed at dusk, but we'd just arrived and were just excited to check everything out and hadn't read the rules yet. Another day, our AA son went back to the condo ahead of us from the beach. Once he walked into the pool area to rinse off his feet, one of the condo owners actually approached him and asked for his room number and explained he wasn't supposed to be walking through there if he wasn't staying there. Who does that Our AA son is only 18 and not a thug looking kid at all! He had just graduated high school and the trip was a graduation gift. Thankfully, our son refused to give our room number and about the time we were walking up, pointed to us and said, ""that's my family."" Again, the man never said a word to us. But, our AA son didn't tell us until later what happened. Of course, this same condo owner was drinking it up with friends all day, their table was lined with coolers and the area where they were stunk of alcohol. Those same pool rules that our AA son seemed to violate on day 1 also say no food and drinks at the pool. So, only some rules apply to certain people. I wouldn't even let my kids swim that day because of that group drinking so much. Again, no one EVER approached my husband, myself or our younger son to ask us a single question during our stay. But, our AA son was questioned on 2 different occasions. That alone was enough to make us want to leave early. The only good part of staying here was the fact that our particular unit was oceanfront. Our owner took a little pride in his unit so while it was older and dated, the unit was decent. But, all the rest that I wrote above just sort of ruined the week for us."

It's a nice space, with lots of amenities. However as an interracial couple we felt pretty out of place, there were very few people of color staying at the resort. And the staff definitely treated us differently from the others. My husband was even ID'd at the bar after being there for several days, no one else was. It was microagressions like this that made us not feel welcomed.The resort is very expensive, so we would expect to be treated the same as everyone there. This wasn't the case. We won't be going back. We even wrote to them after this happened and got no response. Hoping for a more inclusive and supportive space for all queer men, not just some."

The clerk told him free water is only for gold and plantinum members.  After the man left, while I was checking in he offered me a water.  I found this odd because I am not a gold or platinum member.  I am not accusing anyone of racism because I do not know the whole story but I did find it interesting that the only person denied a water happened to be the only black man that asked for one.2 The main door to the front lobby was locked.  No sign, explanation anything just locked.  However the door just around the corner was wide open.  I am not sure I understand why that would be.

I arrived at the Inn at approximately 12:30 am all I wanted was my room and sleep. As soon as I got to the lobby, the front desk failed to greet or even acknowledge me, I literary waited about four minutes before she even made eye contact with me. I informed the front desk that I made a prior reservation, so she asked for my ID and the credit card I used to make the reservation. I took our my temporary ID issued by the state of Indiana, and she immediately said I cannot take that paper. Did I ask her why Since this was a legal document and I had even used at the airport. She said that she needed to scan the document. So I unfolded the documents and showed her the bar code. She then said, "" I am not taking this document because it's not a valid document."" I then told her that if she was not aware that this, in fact, is a legal document and unless she had a policy or a company handbook that prohibit this document, she could not turn me away. She immediately said, "" Well, you people are always providing illegal document."" Mind you, I took this very personal since I am Latino and I do not tolerate any type of racism. I immediately asked her to get a hold of her supervisor and to provide me with her name. She said she was not giving me my room until I provided her with a legal document. I continued to tell her that the temporary document was a legal document issued by the State of Indiana. She then said she was not calling her supervisor nor was going to give me her name. I had never in my entire life felt so disrespected and humiliated simply by the color of my skin. So of course, I told her that she picked on the wrong Latino because I am educated, know my rights, and I do not tolerate racism.  She then continued to ignore me as I kept on asking about my room. Another guest walked in and asked what was going on, so I explained what happened and he said that he had checked in earlier with a temporary ID as well. So he went and got it from his room and showed it to her. So she said, "" I don't care what you showed earlier, I am not giving HIM his room until he provides me with a valid and legal document."" The other guest then said, ""I cannot believe you are doing this to him, you were present when the other front desk took my temporary ID. Are you racist or what is your deal with him"" I then thanked the gentleman for standing up for me but it was impossible to even talk to her. I waited for more than an hour before I got my room. As I was walking away, I heard her say something like, ""these Mexicans"". I ignored her comment and went straight to my room. The best thing about this is that I have multiple recording from the interaction with this front desk employee. I am more than willing to share this with the corporate office and/or social media. Red Roof Inn, I implore that you look into this. Racism is not acceptable and I think it does not align with your Corporate values."

Since this is a very long journey we stopped for one day at Tarbes. Looking for relaxing places in the neigbourhood we decided to go to the high mountains, and specifically to Estaing, since it was said was one of the best small villages in France.So, after some driving in the mountains we arrived at Estaing at 4 p.m. The place was lovely so we decided to stop, have an ice cream, take a walking tour, and then decide wether we would stay for dinner or not. In the road we find a signal that said something like ""Snack pour un randonneur""; it was a nice caffe of a beautifull camping named Pyrnes Natura. We parked our old Saxo next to the wall of the caffe and went inside the caffe garden. We check the icecream menu outside and I said to my friend: I need to go to the bathroom, please wait here and then we'll ask for the icecream since she doesn't speak french. So I went inside the caffe. There were some clients chating friendly. I had to pass through them to the WC, I said ""Bonjour, excuse moi"", and I went. Someone who must have been the lady owner said ""Bonjour madame"" and I said ""Bonjour"" back. I rushed into the bathroom. When I was inside my friend phoned me. I was intrigued but I didn't answer since I was finish in no more than 2 minutes. I went outside of the WC, into the door of the bar, and saw her at the entrance of the garden, some 20 meters away. I called her and she said for me to come near her. Meanwhile a man came to me and asked me if I had been in the WC, in english. I said yes. The man said please go out. I was stuned and said ""Estce que je peux m'expliqu"" can I explain myself. And I said in french that yes, I've been to the WC and now was calling my friend to come and ask for the icecreams. The man asked me if I was going to buy icecreams and I said yes. Then he ordered me again to leave, three times, in a menacing way and phisically very near. I was apalled, never been so humiliated in all my 49 years of living.When I arrived near my friend she told me that he had already asked her, very insistently, what she was doing there in the caffe garden  she said she was waiting for me in her bad english. The man asked where I was and she said I was inside. The man went inside, didn't saw me since I was in the bathroom, and came outside ordering her to leave.We are caucasian with a sun tan. We were dressed informally even though the guy was even more poorly dressed than we: training pants and tshirt half out of them; not sure if he was the owner or a security assistant but from the orders I would say he was the owner. We drive a very simple old car. We think that because of racist assumptions we were taken for thiefs or non consumer clients. This has spoiled our last day of hollidays. France, the Office of Tourisme of Val d'Azun, all Offices of Tourism, must act against this."""

If you're accustomed to a modern approach to people who don't have white skin, this isn't the place for you. All but two of the staff were invariably unhelpful and terse to our group, but not at all to people with the ""correct"" complexion. They actually kept my misplaced sunglasses for themselves instead of returning them from the front desk. They did, however, happily take down my personal details without making eye contact. This kind of mentality wouldn't be out of place in country Queensland a few decades ago.Apart from the staff and the rooms, the facilities are a bit below standard but acceptable, there's a pool that's not awful and a pool table that'll play some tricks on you even if you're a shark! The best part, as always with hostels, is the varied and friendly people you'll meet, although those were the minority here, at least when we stayed there.Big plus is Collaroy beach is 60 seconds away.

As I presented my credit card and identification for checkin, he processed my credit card and identification and instead of handing me my items as I handed them to him, he immediately threw my driver license down on the counter and then threw my credit card down on the same counter! I was appalled and shocked that any person would still think its okay to be so blatantly and open with racism and total disrespect.

We had a Travelzoo voucher that came with free maple syrup and 2 drink vouchers. We never received either and after we asked Tom, we were told that both things and coasters will be dropped off at our room. None of those items were ever dropped off. We were the youngest couple at this Inn and the only ones of color, not sure if that was a contributing factor of the differential treatment. We saw other people receive the items and it's a matter of principal to us. False advertising......"

His behavior would have easily caused any HR manager to relieve him at least for the day he treated a fellow employee the way he treated my girlfriend and I today. He was seriously questioning the accuracy of a newly issued New Mexico state ID today. Calling into question the height of my GF and I can only conclude his actions to be drawn on a basis of racism. Mind you, she had already stayed one night, however a disastrous 48minutes  beyond the checkout time of 11AM had passed and when presented with the original credit card used to check in, he did would not accept  it, I offered to pay with a corporate card, he wold not accept either; my name was not on the card though I have valid local ID. We offered cash however would need an additional 50.00 for a deposit. He indicated we would have fiveminutes to pack her room, FIVEMINUTES! I asked if she or I had done something wrong to other than her being 48minutes beyond check out; other than that, No. I asked if who the franchiser was and perhaps I we could see about getting even a little leniency to make a payment that he would accept bear in mind she had the same credit she checked in with at the ready AND I ever offered to pay the extra money so I could ""check in"" an use my corporate card he told me he was where the ""buck stopped"" and there is ""process"" to contacting the owners at which time I mentioned ""I used to broker the sale of hotel properties and I'm asking you to provide the name of that group"" he retorted without hesitating saying to my GF, ""That just got you kicked out"" ...... Having the money, her having stayed one night already; the only conclusion I can see why was behaving in a manor preventing her from staying another night is that he is a Latino and she is white. I am a Mexican and I can tell you, that is all I can conclude. Because if it was not racially based then, when I contact Motel 6 Corporate, The New Mexico Corporation and find the LLC that owns this property; it will have to be a complete failure to meet in the minimum objectives of selling rooms to viable, law abiding, clean and willing customers and he need to be completely relived of his duties. Otherwise, it will have to be something that needs to be heard in a court of law to address and possible racial motives. Not to mention the late check out as stated via Booking.com when the original reservation was made. This is not an ""when available"" feature either. It is clearly a perk given to Booking.com customers and a perk offered only after the hotel/motel optsin to use this perk for Booking.com customers."

It has some very facilities with fair maintenance even you can tell that the hotel has some history. They also treated the Marriot membership well with a suite upgrade. The suite was spacious, cozy and full of elegance. The location was also perfect under short distance to the bus stop that led to the famous old town. Most of the servant at the hotel were polite and friendly. The reason I give this perfect hotel 4 stars is racism. On a breakfast morning, one waiter showed racism and severe discrimination between western and eastern customers. No welcome juice as we started our table, but other western customers had. We plead to sit near the window side to observe the beautiful snow scene but were refused by the same person. There were multiple window side tables available at that time. This is unbearable for such a highend hotel."

They noted, from our booking, that we were on honeymoon and very generously placed a bottle of their own sparkling Blanc de Blanc and strawberries in the room for our arrival.The room was great, it was not large and Hilton'ish, it was a reasonable sized room decorated in local Tuscan style.We ate at the Tuscan restaurant, not the gourmet, the service was good and the food was simple and tasty.  Their own olive oil was marvelous, their own Brunello di Montelcino the top one of their offering was mindblowing, worth every single cent.Pool area very pleasant set in a wonderful Tuscan countryside.Breakfast, well I ordered bacon and scrambled eggs. My wife says I make the best in the world, well I have to concede defeat, both the eggs and the bacon were indescribably delicious and, to be honest, I have no idea how they made the bacon so crispy without too much greasy residue, enough said.  Everything else was excellent as well.We will be returning sometime and Can't recommend it enough.Footnote: we were a mixed couple and experienced no racism of any kind we also stayed at the hotel Castello di Velona, see review on this, the two are on par but for very different tastes.

I chose to stay off property and come to the resort on a daily basis. I was stopped at the gate and was refused entry. I even heard the receptionist ask if I was African when the gate called to check my identity. I was appalled. When my European friend came to the gate, I watched as he was let in with no questions asked. I was shocked! A resort owned by foreign investors, providing a service that is supposed to be OPEN TO THE PUBLIC should not mistreat its hosts. My aunt, her two kids and brother were turned away from the gate despite a message being left with the reception. My family is well respected in Nairobi and watamu and we provide business to many enterprises including sending our relatives to the Sun Palm resort. Until this policy changes, I will avidly protest staying at this resort. I understand security is a concern, but making Africans treat each other this way is disgraceful and enforces a backward colonial mindset. You have the power and the ability to be an example to the community. We appreciate your business but do not be so blatantly disrespectful to the countrymen and women who make Kenya what it is."

In brief this place supports prostitution, some of the girls also being of questionable age. The owner, Bianca, is happy to allow this and seemingly makes her money from it. Alongside this she openly treats her very good staff despicably and uses racist remarks towards them in the public areas.I would imagine her high ratings are mostly from her regular European tenants who love the freedom she allows while they exploit young girls and boys. Watching an old man pay off a young girl in reception whilst you eat your breakfast puts the place in perspective. I would advise potential customers to thoroughly read reviews as we should have done prior to booking. Even some of the higher ratings make the same complaints and the star ratings given don't seem to match up....For what it's worth, the rooms and facilities are as described. Basic, but nice enough for the price. Bedsheets were scratchy, but I guess they are well used! Hot and stuffy with only a fan. Fridge and cooking facilities are useful for more flexibility.We chose not to use the pool having seen at least two couples being 'intimate' in it. Fittingly they have a cocktail on the menu called Swimming pool with a mysterious 'white cream' addition...Despite her apparent friendly nature the owner Bianca loves to gossip about her guests. Within an hour we were told about the medical conditions of one of her guests and later once we decided to leave, she discussed it with every guest that came within earshot  perhaps it's a surprise to her that some English people can understand German In the two days we were there we witnessed her shout at and abuse her staff on at least 3 occasions in the bar area, including using some strongly racist terms which I hoped in this day and age were not used. I do have to say the local staff were excellent, attentive, friendly and very helpful. They assisted in our poor attempts at learning Swahili, and all from the groundsmen, security and the waiters were happy and friendly throughout. Undeserving of the way they were treated. Please think twice before booking here and funding this place. It's 'quiet and out of the way location' are only good for one thing: exploitation of young and the less well off by dirty needy old men and possibly women who can't find affection without paying for it."

They told us to go and stand in the counter but if we are sure we gonna spend qr1100, miracles will happen and the tables will be available. I experienced racism first hand. Qatar is multi cultural, this should not happen. I think this is something that this hotel does because even the previous bad comments are all about racism. We are so pissed off we just left!!

We planned to have couple of other friends too to join us there and have some food and beverages. But the lady at the entrace refused to let us in with an excuse that we had not made a prior reservation at the 'club'. Her racist attitude was so evident as she looked at us from top to bottom and simply nodded her head negatively. The club was empty, as i inquired with her if it was busy. As a hotelier, I am aware that signature or finedining restaurants do prefer to take prior reservations in our part of the world. But, since when have doha lounge bars started this policyInterestingly, this afternoon, I was chatting with one of my european colleagues who shared a similar incident where she felt sorry for four african ladies who were refused entry to Oxygene at La Cigale, while my colleague was allowed to enter.Atleast the hotel can come up with a better excuse without showing their racist attitude!"

Why you discriminated me because I am an Indian and did not allow me to enter your Hotel bar  Skywalk on 11th Floor in your Hotel. I work for a reputed company  Vodafone and I am completely aware of these type of discrimination.Your receptionist on 11th Floor gave me a reason that it is your hotel policy that only couples are allowed. I just wanted to have a drink and some food in a nice place.Now I am staying alone in Doha. Do I not have the human right to enjoy a drink and food in a authorized and legitimate hotelDon't you have any humanitarian policy in your hotel

My Daughter has a Allergy  Low Intolerance to Gluten and Wheat . She can't have Spices , or she can go in to Shock .

My Daughter checked the Order and couldn't find her Side Order  so she asked where it is and they told her that it is mixed in to mine . She was n Tears , because she was hungry and that is one of the Things she can eat , they not even offered a Replacement , so she took the Bag and came back , because she dosnt want any Trouble . When we looked in to the Bag , the Pancake Syrup was missing . She didn't want to mention anything , but when I seen my Daughter in Tears , I couldn't help it but to say something ,  you need new Kitchen Staff .

Location is good and convenient. Stored our luggage at no cost. These are basic services that are to be expected when staying at any BB accommodation.The owner does not live in the house and was not presented when we had questions and did not show up in the mornings as promised.I would suggest that travellers pay a little more to have a more pleasant experience such as reliable hot showers, hair dryers, strong wifi signal and staff to help out. I am disappointed that the Chilean owner questioned our interest and visit to the 'Human Rights and Memory museum' that explains the tragic Chilean history which is also the no 1 thing to do on TripAdvisor in Santiago. In fact, he was very discouraging about it. I would have recommended this place as a budget accommodation due to its location but his racist email to my wife shows the owner, Christian's true colours and reveals his disrespect for other cultures. He did not even have the courtesy to reply to the review on TripAdvisor but instead wrote a nasty personal email to my wife who had arranged our whole trip.Would NOT recommend this to any traveller."

Taxis were organised promptly also. Our luggage was stored whilst we were away for a couple days also. Excellent location, close to landmarks, transport shops etc.THE NOT SO GOOD The property is an old and creaky guest house. It has it's own rustic charm but potential customers should be prepared for things like poor plumbing and limited hot water. Not a nice feeling stepping into the shower in the morning and being ankle deep in last nights cold water. For the price range however this seems to be the norm.Our host also stuffed up our reservations. Twice. Not all rooms in this property are equal, in fact the one we ended up with was quite claustrophobic and in my opinion not worth the 1015 usd discount that was offered. Breakfast was fairly basic  tasty nonetheless. THE UGLYOur friendly host doesn't seem to respond well to constructive criticisms and unfortunately instead of responding to a post on tripadvisor, he resorted to contacting his last reviewer via her personal email to leave some fairly sarcastic, distasteful and discourteous remarks. To quote; ""...Thank you again for your input... as this helps me thrive in making my travelerssic happy and deal with Asian guests pretending to be Australian"" Now I may be taking this way out of context Christian, so I'll offer you the chance to explain these remarks publicly on Tripadvisor. The way I see it, despite the fact that we have paid you and left, this still falls under service. In this instance, you've failed yourself by resorting to such petty racist remarks.I don't doubt that other travellers have and will continue to have good experiences with your venue for as long as they don't try to offer any constructive criticisms. and as long as they're not Asian either"

The house is quaint and the common areas are pleasantly decorated.  the large rooms not the small rooms are good value for money.  comfortable beds.  owner initially  quite helpful and friendly giving us a map of Santiago Bad: the small double bed rooms are tiny, with hardly enough space for two people to squeeze past each other and no ventilation in the bedroom itself. The bathroom is also tiny, and the shower floods the bathroom if you take a shower for more than 2 mins due to poor drainage.  Owner overbooked rooms. On the first and second night one couple on our group ended up with the small room because the owner overbooked both nights. This happened yet again this time to me and my fianc on another night after coming back from Valparaiso even though we were assured that there would be the large room available for us. In fact, we had a booking elsewhere for that night and the owner encouraged us to cancel the other booking because he reasoned that it would be easier for us to leave our bags at Travesia only for us to discover that he had given our large room away to other travellers  we ended up with the tiny room.  cold showers if you are the last bedroom to use the shower. I understand that the house is old, which adds to the charm, but it would be nice to be warned rather than coming back to the hotel room on a chilly night and then taking a cold shower.  smelly bathrooms with poor ventilation. Ugly: One of our group posted a reasonable and fair review on TripAdvisor with pros and cons. She then got a long and abusive email which ended with the rather racist paragraph ""Thank you again for your input  as this helps me thrive in making my travelers happy and deal with Asian guests pretending to be Australian."" My review would have been 3 stars but I took one star off for the despicable email which to me is terrible service from the owner."

I will try to give the most neutral comment.Hotel is not looking like the pictures. All furnitures and the building are much older. The location is good. It is just couple of minutes to central station. In our vacation we didn't use any public transportation and walked everywhere. Hotel is not close all of them but it is not a big city you can walk.Hotel was generally clean.There is no 1 big size bed, there are 2 of them connected and there is a gap between them. It is wring information if you see it is a king size bed.Windows are really old and wooden. They are not closing completely and because of that you can hear the noise of street. But in the night it was pretty silent.I have a insect phobia and when I saw the windows I needed to ask if they have a problem with insects. But our host was pretty sarcastic and asked where I am from after that became a little bit racist and said here is not Turkey.It is writing ""don't touch"" on air conditioner controller. It was hot inside and we asked our host if it can be cooler and he said ""it is not possible, we have automated system which is holding the coldness around 26 degrees, I can't change it even I want to""After that we said okay but in the night air conditioner was working whole night and inside was ice cold. Here a lot of people complain about it was not working. So I am thinking he did this on purpose.He was so rude and was not accepting any of his mistakes. I mean on internet it was writing wrong checkin time and in the paper which stays at room it was writing wrong check out time and we had some problems with them. He woke us up and said you have to check out. And when we show him the paper he said you should have check it online. But online page was already wrong too. All this comments about him are true. He is answering and blaming others but it is definitely not true. He has some problems, just a warning for you."

Called the one in charge and he showed up after 5 minutes. It has a lousy and dark entrance. It is like staying in the train station since the room was not soundproof and you can hear the trains and even the PA system calls from a train in the street nearby! The booking was for a double sized bed and we got two individual beds set together... The guy explained me that ""there are no double sized queen or king mattresses in Italy"", which is false. The automatic A/C doesn't work very well and it was off during the day so the room vas very hot! They also cancelled my reservation the morning after I arrived for a ""no show"" reason I believe they did this to avoid being reviewed, since they realized I was not pleased to be there. The person in charge was very rude and with an ungentlemanly conduct. For a reference, read the responses to all the negative reviews where there are unpolite replies from the staff to the customers.

Racist towards English people also. Disgusting staff and management. Dont do a thing to help anyone. Very rude and kicked me out of hotel room when I was being sick from their disgusting food! Didnt even let me lie down in the lobby area when I was passed out after being so poorly! Cant get a sun lounger unless you get up at 6am every day and put a towel on the bed. NOTHING for children no entertainment what so ever. Everything it lists is a lie. No WiFi unless you want to sit in the un air conditioned lobby.  Its more like a prison camp with all the rules than a hotel. Cant swim in pool after 7. Nothing for children to do after this time and they wont allow them to play around sun lounger area or in lobby as they are a nuisance. When 5 children are on their holiday who have just met and entertained themselves for hours seen as though there is nothing to do at all in the hotel. The rooms are another thing. Blankets are all ripped and old. Air conditioning didnt work for 4 nights due to them not having it on the correct settings for it to be cold! Very dirty and old fashioned. The food and drinks are below even 1 star as well as the diabolical service I received from staff. Wouldnt even allow us an extra pillow for my disabled mother who was in agony from the rock like beds and having to sit on a chair as there isnt any sun loungers as they save them for Turkish guests first. The last comment is how they told us we couldnt celebrate and have a couple of drinks for our country in the World Cup and threatened to kick us out of the hotel. Possibly the worst holiday I have ever been on.

If you had bothered to read the info you were given you would have seen that they have an agest problem not a racist problem.

The first words from the owner to us was""I am going to give you the talk I give all young people, we are a family site all about Mum Dad and the kid so at half ten silence is compulsary"" which is completely fair and we went on to say we are all in our late twenties, early thirties and are just here to hang out at the beach...the owner went on to tell us a story about a certain nationality which stayed on the campground two years ago..they did not adhere to Mandatory silence and went down to the beach swimming and had to be rescued by the coast guard.  They then stayed the night in her house and left a mess when they left. .of course I understand she was annoyed by this but to greet a group of people of a mixed nationalities was racist and really offended us, with two of us being this nationality. We said nothing but the people that were waiting behind us even commented how rude she was. Then she also added that if we did anything after half ten she would throw us out straight away. The following morning before I left I went to the reception to make a complaint and was greeted by another woman. I told her about what happened and how I did not think people that work in hospitality should behave like this and how unprofessional she was. The owner then came out..she said that it was not racist and had every right to say that. The other lady went on to say that there have been three groups of people they have had trouble with. .the Brazilians, Argentines and the Irish. I told her that is simply racist and you can't speak like that to people. They told me to leave and so I did. I have never encountered anything like this before in NZ. Absolutely apauled by both of their behaviour.To top it all of the campsite was basic and the ammenities were average at best."

I showed up to the property @ 1:10pm, I asked if I could check in, Lydia told me the room wasn't ready, I reminded her that I called and she confirmed it was ready. after further review of my reservation, she discovered I wasn't scheduled to arrive that day. I then asked can I cancel the reservation due to no availability , Lydia replied no, she cant help me! after asking a few times I then decided to call Hilton to fix the matter, I then told Lydia never mind ill call Hilton, she rolled her eyes and walked towards the back of the front desk, that's when I was shocked to hear this young lady say as she walked away "" stupid black b"" I was shocked and in disbelief, I turned and said, excuse me what did you call me she just gave me a very nasty look and kept walking. that moment I realized that this young lady has a issue with African American people and her racist comment towards me will not ignored. my colleague who is Caucasian went and spoke to the same girl and had the same request, Lydia was very nice to him and treated him totally different. He was just as upset as I was because he witnessed what I went through, she clearly has personal discomfort forwards minorities and this type of behavior is not tolerated, especially at the front desk of a major hotel chain. I will be contacting Hilton corporate office about this, I will also reach out to the media and my company corp office, so that we can make sure no one else goes through what I had to endure at this hotel.

Stay well away! Very racist owner!,"I had booked three nights 15 to 18 February at Yale Kandy park hotel, Kandy, Sri Lanka. It was advertised as a five star hotel but it was more like abandoned half done construction site! We drove an hour up  very tight unsafe roads in the mountain to get to the hotel this was not mentioned any where in the hotel description. Upon arrival we were greeted by the lost looking Sri Lankan workers they had no electricity at the hotel and asked us to sit and wait. We were very concerned for our driver as he had to drive back down the unlit mountain and it was getting dark. We asked him if we could see the rooms, however our standard room was too far away and there was no one to take us. At this point the hotel manager was getting angry and stressed, he started raising his voice and saying I have no time to deal with you, if you want just cancel and leave. He then walked away from us. We were shocked by his mannerism and unprofessionalism. This was very surprising as nothing had happened for him to be so rude. This is not how you greet your guests after climbing several unsafe roads. He was saying to us its the Sri Lankans fault as they are all against him and they are silly and stupid people and are giving him a very big headache all the time. All this time we were standing in darkness.We were told he doesnt have the two rooms we booked and paid for so we would need to stay in a room together with one king bed and two compact beds. The second room we had actually paid for was still under construction. He said that he had two other guests in the hotel and he couldnt give us that room. The state of the hotel was very appalling, we could not leave as by now it was dark and it was too dangerous to drive back down. We had no choice but to stay, non of us wanted to stay, we wanted to find another hotel with polite staff. We decided to spend one night and leave early the next morning. We informed we would stay one night only because he left us no choice.During this night we had no electricity for majority of the night our hot water finished after one girl had a shower and were unable to get hot water for the rest of the night as no electricity. When one person showered it flooded the whole bathroom, one sink was blocked and there were dead flies everywhere. The WiFi was cut and phone lines were also not working. We couldnt charge our phones or tablets, we couldnt communicate with anyone. This is not what you except from a five star hotel.The Sri Lankan workers were treated at such poor levels they kept apologising us to as we had to put up with such a horrible manager. At one point the manager yelled at his employee infront of us and two other guests which was awful to watch. He treated his staff with no respect and blamed them for everything.No one slept that night, we were just on edge the whole time, the fold out beds were so uncomfortable and room was full ridden with insects crawling and dead everywhere. As there was no electricity we had no air conditioning and you can imagine the humidity and heat is unbearable without air conditioning in February in Sri Lanka.We had no dinner that evening as the state of the kitchen was disgusting, the wonder trades illegally he purchased alcohol at very low prices and sells to his guests at triple the price with no license. It is unacceptable in this day and age to have such a hotel running with such a rude incompetent and racist manager. People cannot be treated with such disrespect. Please please reconsider if you are looking to book this hotel, it is nothing close to what the description says, do not let this place ruin your holiday to Sri Lanka."

Racist owner !,"First of all it is at the back of beyond, no taxi is willing to go there. When we reached, we were taken to a row of rooms...which were not a part of the main resort. The main resort was a twenty minutes steep uphill walk. If available, a vehicle was provided. One of our rooms had a stench, which the owner was well aware of. TV was not functioning. Nor the phones  so we had no connection to the main building. Taps were dry, and we had to complain and then wait for someone to come and put on the water pump. Staff was sparse  and difficult to locate, as we were lodged a distance away. Most parts of the ""resort"" were still under construction. There was no swimming pool  the pictures of the infinity pool shown on the site, is only with the villa. There was one cook, with one stove, who also served as a waiter. This was definitely not a relaxed holiday that we envisaged. My daughter had posted a comment and review of our experience, to which we received an unexpected racial reaction and tweet from the owner  against all Indians, and that he would ban allowing Indians to stay at his ""resort"", and that he had told Agoda and others to refuse Indian  booking, as Indians are not welcome ! We informed  Agoda, through whom we had made this booking, and surprisingly, they have done precious little about these racist comments, and still continue to support him instead of boycotting such a racist."

BUT....!But be aware who your hosts are: My girlfriend and I sat on a two person table in the first row. Luckily we met a vietnamese friend from Phu Quoc whilst sitting there. The lady from the bar forbid to take another chair for our friend and said to her, she should leave! We stood up and offered one of our chairs to our friend and the staff said they don't serve her! We recognised, that not one asian person was allowed to sit in the first row. Every 'non western person' was given a seat inside or anywhere away from the street! We were so annoyed... oh and afterwards we weren't served anymore.Last beer here! Please have a look where you have your beer and don't support such an inhuman treatment!"

I asked for a bottle of beer, and a bottle of water because it was hot and I was dehydrated. The owner barked that they don't sell water and then forced us all to leave, because I had the audacity to ask for some water. So we went across the street to a similar bar which is run by nicer people. 96 Bui Vien has a bad rep in Saigon due to the rude staff. There are also rumours of them being racist but I can't say I've ever experienced it. Don't bother giving this place your business, there are plenty of identical bars on Bui Vien offering the same thing for the same prices, with nicer staff. Give them your business instead."

It has cheap drinks and is in the heart of the backpackers district.The owners are just misunderstood. They are NOT racist as implied in other reviews. They are selling the cheapest drinks in the whole street, so logistics is important for them as they are not making as much money as the other rip off bars. They actually have the decency to not rip off foreigners. If you intend to sit there and sip on one drink that will only bring in a couple of cents to them, then yeah, you will probably be better off elsewhere where you will pay three times the price. There will be plenty of people wanting to take your seat at one of the most sociable bar in town.We have been in HCM for two weeks and been there almost every night and had no problems. Just sit where they ask you to sit, keep ordering with a smile and have fun.

We were in the room for just a few minutes, so we went back to the front desk to ask him if we can get a refund... we just told us ""Take everything down and turn everything off""... so we ran to get our moms and kids out of there. We went back to the front desk and he gave us ""our refound"" I still don't know if he made a charge into our credit cards or not.

We invited a friend to go with us and after we got off the river we all decided to pick up some fast food and bring it back to the hotel room and eat before a friend took off back to san marcos. The room was very dingy and smelled like smoke even though it was suppose to be a smoke free room. We didnt mind so much because we just needed a quick place to crash on our way to visit friends.We didnt even make it through our burgers before we got a call from the front desk. On the phone was the manager of the hotel telling us we were being evicted for having a friend in the room. I tried to explain we were just having dinner and she was gonna leave, then he threatened to call the police on me before i was even done explaining this person wasnt going to be staying. He said we couldnt have any people in the room. My girlfriend and i both went down to the front desk to explain that we werent trying to take advantage of him and as it was already getting late we didnt want to have to get all of our stuff and find another hotel. The manager was extremely rude so we decided to just ask for our money back and we would be on our way. He just called the police and said we were threatening him. The police were even less helpful and just said that they had to evict us and we werent getting any money back because the manager wanted us to leave and since its a private property he could evict us whenever. We gathered our things and left, the people that run this business are extremely rude, disrespectful people and most probably filled up their hotel and kicked us out so they could sell the room twice that night. spend the extra couple dollars and get something that isnt a complete dive. Honestly this is the worst experience i have ever had in a hotel. these people should not be in the hotel field and only stay here if you like to be abused."

Instead of making reservations at a hotel, we decided to play it by ear, and after a nice dinner, we chose to stay at the Edelweiss hotel.  It was adorable from the outside, with a German inspired exterior.We saw a banner out front that said they offered reduced rates of 49.95 for Sunday through Thursday.  My husband went inside to ask how much it would be to stay on a Saturday night.  The man told him it was 59.95, so my husband paid for the room.  He asked the man what time we should check out the following day, and the man told him 11:00 A.M.  We were in a nonsmoking room, and we were so excited to be away from home for an evening, we ignored the fact that the room reeked of cigarette smoke.  We also overlooked the brown ooze coming out of the ice machine.  I decided to take a shower, but I discovered that there wasn't any shampoo in the room.  My husband and I walked to the office, about twenty feet from our door, and picked some up from the man at the desk.  After our showers, we settled in and called it a night, falling asleep.  We were hoping for a chance to get some rest and to sleep in the next morning.  The broken air conditioner kept us up all night.  At 8:30 A.M., we woke up to an unwelcome wakeup call, which we did not ask for.  At 9:30 A.M., we were woken once again with a second wakeup call, which again, we did not ask for.  At 10:30, we received a third call.  This time, it was a woman asking if we were going to check out, or if we were going to stay another night.  I told her we were going to be checking out.  At 10:50 A.M., as I was packing and changing, there was a violent, loud pounding on the door.  I hid, half naked, in the bathroom doorway, afraid that they were just going to burst in.  My husband answered the door.  The man who had checked us in the previous night, was at the door.  He asked my husband in a hostile tone, ""are you checking out today""  My husband replied, ""yea, yea, we're checking out at 11:00.""  He shut the door, the man left, and we continued to get ready to leave.  We started to wonder if it was daylight savings, but that was a few months ago!We packed up our Volvo, then walked to the office to check out.  We wanted to ask if there was a reason we were rushed out of our room, and we wanted to let them know how uncomfortable the morning had been.  When we reached the office, the man and a woman were behind the desk, talking with a customer.  We were waiting for them to finish their conversation, but the man reached out and said ""thank you,"" indicating the key.  My husband began to say what a horrible experience it was, and I asked them, ""is there any particular reason we were rushed out of our hotel room this morning""  They said yes, because we had received a discounted rate, checkout was 10:30.  We told them that we were not informed of this the night before, and that we in fact were not even informed it was a discounted rate.  My husband asked them that if they rent a room at a discount, does that also mean they give the discount rate service  Astonishingly, they replied ""yes.""  In a furious tone, the woman said, ""that is why we have the discounted rate, for people like you.""  The man then added, ""you people don't even have shampoo to wash your hair.""  One of them also told us we were uneducated, to which I replied, ""I beg your pardon""  The insults were totally unprevoked.  My husband and I were flabbergasted, and he was furious.  He pushed their paper sign off the edge of the counter, and walked out of the office.  The woman told me, ""this is the kind of person you're with.""  As if I married a lower class of person.  Maybe she thought a white woman shouldn't be married to a Mexican man.  I asked how we were supposed to know we were supposed to check out early, when we didn't even know we had received a discount rate.  The woman told me to leave, and said they didn't want ""our kind"" there anyway.  I was dumbfounded, and for the second time, I asked her, ""I beg your pardon""  She told me to leave again, and I walked out of the office.My husband and I got into our car, and decided to stop in at the office to ask for a business card so we could call the appropriate authorities and report this heinous treatment.  We decided I should go in, since my husband was in a more agitated state than I.  The man was outside at this point, and asked me where I was going.  I said I wanted a business card, walked past him to the inside, and spoke to the woman.  She gave me a card, and pointed at a sign.  She had to turn it around, but on the back, it said, ""discount rate checkout 10:30.""  I asked her how we were supposed to know that, since we obviously didn't even know we had a discounted rate, and because there were about eight other signs on the desk.  I wasn't even sure the sign was facing the right direction the night before.  She simply told me in aggressive tone, ""LEAVE.""As I left the office, I saw that the man had approached the Volvo, and was antagonizing my husband through the window.  The man was saying ""oh, well then what school did YOU go to""  I got in the car, and my husband was considering getting out to talk to the man, with one foot out of the car, shouting back at the man.  My husband was defending himself, and only getting angrier.  The man said he was going to call the police, for what reason I do not know.  I told my husband just to forget it, so he sat down and we drove away.  Contrary to these people's beliefs, my husband and I are educated and well spoken.  I am a fashion designer, renowned world wide, and my husband is a highly successful business owner.  I went to college for art at one of the top schools in the nation.  We don't look like clean cut, trendy dressers.  I have a nose ring, and he has an eyebrow ring.  We are what I can only describe as ""alternative.""  Regardless of these facts, and even if we had never been to school in our lives, or if we looked like we stepped out of the gutter, we should have been treated with respect, and we should have been allowed our dignity.  We paid for a service, and we were treated horribly.  These people were racist, classist, and rude, with no reason to hand out such treatment, to anyone of any race, of any class, with any level of education.   This is unacceptable."

I have stayed in a lot of hotels all around the world and the Atlas Almohades is by far the worst I have ever experienced.The receptionist was racist and xenophobic and made it clear he did not want to serve my nationality. Whilst asking for directions he would actually just turn  walkaway, preferring to help customers who were obviously 'more local'. I've never seen anything like it. He became aware that I had found out his name so I could complain to management. Whilst I was getting directions from the very helpful concierge, this receptionist rudely interrupted and started shouting in my face ""what's the problem, what's the problem"" and then walked away laughing loudly. On arrival the receptionist failed to inform me about any of the facilities in the hotel such as the gym and the availability of breakfast in my room. The room itself had no hotel guide so I missed breakfast. The hotel is next to the beach and a lot of nightclubs which are open till gone 4am. The hotel also has a loud music bar downstairs and a nightclub upstairs. You will struggle to get any sleep here. Both bars are popular with prostitutes. I was hounded by one who wouldn't take no for an answer. The bar staff didn't care less and even allowed her to try to put a drink on my bill.My room had a wardrobe that was falling apart and unpainted plaster repairs across the ceiling. A lot of items in the room where either missing or broken, including the air conditioning. The bed sheets where worn and thin and did not fit the bed. Meaning they would come off the bed in the night leaving me sleeping on a bare stained mattress.I did get breakfast on my second day. I was glad I missed it the first day. The only thing that was edible was some croissants.Whilst at this hotel I emailed both the group head office and hotel manager and emailed them again on returning home. No reply.I've slept in 5 star hotels and 2 star hostels. Leaky tents and storm battered boats. The Atlas Almohades will always be remembered as the worst experience I have ever had."

It has been close to a year since I visited this property with my husband and still the bad memories cease to settle. We had been very excited about our visit to Paris. My husband was visiting the University and I was tagging along. This property is about an hour away from central Paris and one needs to hop across a bus and a train at least to reach the destination... frankly, I wasnt too bothered about this.Rules of feedback tell me that I should cite good things first... We liked the property. In that season, with the colors beginning to show  it was pretty and tidy. The room cleaning staff was good but the reception and cafetaria staff sucks, to say the least. The wifi worked well and the technical staff at the hotel were cooperative.I had a special meal requirement and was carrying my food packets that I needed to warm before I have my meal. For all the 5 days we stayed there, I struggled to get the staff to get me to warm the packets since there was no microwave in the room. The lady at the reception, who was too quick when I asked her to furnish my bill, said she didnt understand English  so couldnt help. The cafetaria folks, obviously cared more about people who were dining in, and kept me waiting for more than half an hour in my pyjamas at the dining area  before I gave up and stormed out. Ultimately, it was the electric kettle in the room, which I used to warm the packets... I still get goosebumps in anger and disgust when I recall this experience. The only saving grace was a gentleman called Jihed I think who was very courteous and helpful, but his shifts never really matched the time when I needed help.I hadnt heard notsogreat things about French hospitality and this hotel tried its best to prove the point. Our next stay in Paris was overnight at a small 2 star hotel near Garu de Nord and I would say it was 200x better in terms of warmth and hospitality than this 'luxury' property. I have stayed in another Novotel in Bangkok, and the experience was exquisite  so I guess the problem was essentially with the staff. I am sorry, I have nothing but anger and disgust to offer to this hotel."

I purchased an ice cream cake as a surprise for the children and set up a little party in the hotel room for the children. Before I made the purchase of ice cream cake I called the hotel and spoke to Wendy and she stated that she could hold the ice cream cake in the freezer for the children until I was ready to get the cake. That was the only discussion that we had regarding this cake. My family and I were in the pool and the manager Stephanie burst through the door with a side kick employee and Stephanie put her hand in the air and said there is no food allowed in the pool and we looked at her and said what are you talking about we don't have any food here and she said someone told me that you were going to have a cake in here and I said well someone told you wrong. Stephanie said I am the manager here and I run this hotel. Stephanie did not walk in and ask us any questions she just walked in and was very rude and racist we were the only AfricanAmericans in there in the pool she was a Caucasian woman and she was very disrespectful in front of 5 little children and 5 adults. We were even supposed to stay an additional day. However we checked out of the hotel a day early, we did not feel welcomed or comfortable at that hotel at all. I immediately got out of the pool and went to grab the ice cream cake because I was totally disgusted by the service from Stephanie, a manager who was supposed to set an example and be a professional. When Stephanie went to get the cake she gave it to me and said she doesn't know why I was so upset. I informed her that her actions were rude and unprofessional. I took the cake and told her to have a good day. No one ever mentioned having food in the pool or in that area at all that was not the plan and that was never even talked about with Wendy so I don't know where she received that information. This was supposed to be family fun time and Stephanie came right in and ruined it with her racist attitude. My family and I will never stay at this property again. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. No one should be treated this way. If I had the choice I would not tap any circle  to rate this hotel."

The only reason we did not cancel at this point was that it was non refundable and we had pre booked it. Upon arriving, the staff overcharged part of stay; we took care of the charges, however, two days before they arrived. When checking out they were told that the were higher. When they asked why the charges were more, the staff made excuse after excuse. Despite us showing them the information we had given and pre agreed on, they still fought to raise the price.

However, the WORST part of the hotel experience was the staff.  While staying at the hotel I saw a group of Asians checking in.  As they talked to each other in their native language in the lobby two hotel staff pointed at and laughed at them behind their backs.  My husband and I are also Asian and experienced some of the most indifferent interactions with the hotel staff that we have ever experienced.  Later that night my husband and I got food poisoning from the hotel wings, which an employee later told us we should never eat.  We asked the hotel if we could have a late checkout because of being sick from their food, but no one with authority to make that decision was in the hotel.  We left the hotel at 3:00 am because of how sick we were from their food and how unhelpful the staff was.  Staff did not even apologize for our sickness nor help us with our bags as we left.  When calling the hotel to discuss the food poisoning and racially prejudice behavior of their employees management was indifferent.  Two managers straight up lied to me and said they could not refund us because we made the purchase through Groupon, when Groupon said the hotel just needs to approve a refund to refund us.  The management was indifferent to the employees who were pointing at and laughing at the Asian party checking in.  Dont ever stay here, bad/stinky rooms, food poisoning, and RACIST staff and management, unless you are a bigot yourself, then you will fit right in."

He was not particularly welcoming, but we ignored this, as my partner and I were not going this man spoil our holiday. When we made our way down to our room, we noticed that the door had been left open to let the room air. We quickly unloaded our belongings into the room, and then went out for the evening.Upon returning to the Motel around 9.00pm, we went into our room, and noticed a very unpleasant smell in the room. We realised that as it was a very cold Hamilton evening, that once we turned the heater on, there would be little escape from this smell.My partner tried to contact the office by telephone, but after 4 attempts, decided to walk down to reception, to see if there was another room available.Speaking with the owner / manager person who had checked us in, this person rapidly got agitated and agressive saying that he had Indians in the room room the night before, and making very unkind, derogatory remarks about an entire race.We explained that we would be unable to sleep in this room, and that we wanted another room. We were told rather agressively, that he did not like my race either, and if he had know what race I was over the telephone, he would not have take my reservation. He then came out from behind his counter, and tried to physically intimidate my partner. I actually thought this man was going to hit my partner.At this point we told him that we were leaving, and I was relieved that he had not asked for my credit card details upon check in. As we walked away, he continued to shout racist and derogatory comments at us in front of other guests. This was a totally humiliating experience, which I hope no other person ever has to endure. I like to believe that as human beings, that we have evolved as a race, and that this primative dirty little man is not representative of Hamilton Moteliers in general. My only advice is that if you are not happy in what you are doing, that take a step towards making a change. We only have one life to live."

Rooms are very average with very little space to move around. There are hardly any facilities near the hotel. And honestly, there isn't anything great about this hotel.But what ticked me off the most was the racist behavior of the staff. I am proudly an Indian origin, however my skin color has nothing to do with the way I should be treated.Our breakfast was served in a dingy part of the rooftop restaurant away from where the other guests were being served. When I walked into the regular dining area, I was treated disrespectfully and was told ""you are Indian, you go sit there"", pointing at the separate place where our group breakfast was laid out. And the breakfast served to our group was ALL LEFTOVERS and did not even include the full breakfast buffet which the other hotel guests were served. We had practically nothing to eat in the 'So called"" buffet served to us. The fruits were clearly leftover cuts from the previous day dumped in one big bowl, the bread was stale, the eggs were made and kept there since hours and not even heated. There was no coffee, no cereal, nothing. There was practically nothing to eat. So the racism was from what they served us for breakfast to how we were treated. I wasn't the only one who was told harshly to go away from the regular dining area. My father and a few more travelers from our group were told the same thing as well with a specific mention to ""YOU ARE INDIAN, YOU GO SIT THERE"". These were the words of the serving staff AND the CHEF who came out to assist the serving staff in verbally assaulting us  treating us disrespectfully.Of course it did not end here. A complaint at the front desk got us regular breakfast the other day, but with no different treatment. They had harsh facial expressions, didn't care, and were not at all apologetic. In fact the entire staff of the hotel behaved like it was their right to treat us that way, including the front desk. The manager of the hotel did not even come forward with an apology in spite of asking to speak to him.The front desk said they would have a meeting, but said they know their staff wouldn't do anything like that. Even when we left, no apologies and no remorse.Sad sad sad to see this at a Ramada Group Hotel.We talk of equality over the globe, and here skin color gives such people the right to treat another badly. Haha! Not sure if these people have even gotten out of their small town so see what the concept of the ""World"" is.Horrible experience from check in to rooms to to food to check out."

Hospitality  NONE","My niece and her companion arrived at the Villa Sol after being delayed hours by the airlines.  It was almost 9pm.  The room was a prepaid package.  The hotel wanted a credit card for damage deposit.  That's expected.  This was one of 5 trips purchased in a packaged through VIP International.  The girls presented their debit card, but the hotel refused it saying it had to be a credit card.  Then they escorted the girls by security to the front gate and deposited them on the street at 11:00pm.  NEVER GO TO THIS HOTEL!   Was it because they were black I think so.  They could have taken the deposit on the debit card, let the girls into their room and sorted in the morning.  Today I called the hotel.  They told me ""too bad"".  I told them I would write them a very bad review and also get an attorney.  He said ""Do it!""  I spoke to Edward.  A very bad man.   It was by sheer luck, that I live not only in Costa Rica, but close to the Villa Sol.  I have stayed their in the past when we were building our house.  It was dirty and the service was awful.  I suggest you go anywhere else.   My next letter will be to the Tourism Department of Costa Rica.  Makes this beautiful country look bad."

The waiter would not give us a menu for coffee in the cocktail den, instead insisting that they only had coffee, cappuccinos, and tea, and the next thing we know, the hotel seated a couple in the main bright restaurant even though they were only having drinks. I have never experienced such blatant racism. We immediately got up and went to the hostess to tell her what happened, and instead of apologizing, her manager just told us that she makes the rules. It was disgusting. We left immediately."

For the past 8 years on travel, we have insisted on staying at a Hilton Hotel. But, this experience at Double Tree by Hilton LA Rosemead was devastating. Let's start with an AsianAmerican staff at front desk. He was very rude to my husband and I. A bottle of opened wine was found under the mattress, and then I realized that the housekeeper didn't change a clean sheet before we move in. However, this guy didn't really seem to care and act as if we were bothering him, he even said: ""You stayed here four nights and just found it this morning Why you guys move the mattress"" We were shocked by his astonishing response. The real issue is there is a bottle of opened wine in the bed, is the housekeeper didnt clean our room carefully. If my husband didn't drop his phone under the headboard we wouldn't be able to see the wine in the bed. Also we wouldn't know the fact that they didn't change a clean sheet before we move in. If we didn't happen to see the wine, Im pretty sure it will be there like forever.There was a huge mosquito or maybe a spider in the bathroom during our stay. I don't know what is it. It is uncommon to see any worms in hotel but we see here and the size of this mosquito or spider is too huge, more than one inch. Each time when we returned to our room, there is always some trash, such as empty water bottles, left in the room. On the third day, I returned to hotel after my conference in downtown, the room hasnt been cleaned yet. The housekeeper finally came around 4:30 pm. We asked her to come back a few minutes later, but she never show up. No housekeeping at all on that day. We talked with the lady who is in charge of housekeeping in the hotel. She said it is normal for housekeeper comes late. It USUALLY happens. But it is allowable for housekeeper not show up at all at Hilton chainWe also spoke to the manager over the phone. He was not willing to help either. His first question to my husband was:"" when are you guys going back to China He never met us, how could he possibly judge we are going back to China after the trip Under this situation, I don't think as a manager in this hotel, should ask us any question like this. Should he apologize for the dereliction of duty of housekeepers first However, the manager threatened me:"" you can tell everyone in the hotel you found a bottle of opened wine in the bed, he doesn't really care. "" The way he is talking is so arrogant, I can't believe this is how a manager in Hilton family communicate to his guests.So far weve been waiting here for almost 2 hours, nobody in this hotel is willing to help. I booked my trip with Expedia, customer service contacted them quite a few times but most of time they just ignore it. I realized they are not going to solve the issue and decided to end the conversation with them and checked out. What's even worse, we saw an additional 250 charge for room damage. The front desk said the housekeeper reported on 17th because of smoke, the second day since we moved in. However, no one ever said anything about the charge until we check out.  What is the duty of housekeeper The duty of housekeeper in this hotel is no longer about keeping the room clean but looking for any evidence in the room that can charge client's additional money, therefore the hotel can get a quick revenue boost at our expense. Think about this, if the housekeeper was able to find any tiny evidence of smoke, why can't she see the wine in the bed, mosquito in the bathroom and empty water bottles in the room  What's more, we were charged 31 for a movie which I believe it should be 19.99 plus tax. The California tax for a movie is 50 I feel doubletree in Rosemead is trying to make some extra money from us. Even though most of staffs here are AsianAmerican, unfortunately they are extremely unfriendly to Asian guests. This is the first time that we are being mistreated and look down by hotel staffs and manager. The front desk, especially the manager and the other guy I mentioned above, discriminate against us. Are they doing this because they thought we are tourists Are they doing this frequently to other tourists already Think about managers question: When are you going back to China You can tell anyone in the hotel you find wine in the bed, I dont care. Most tourists have no place to complain about, is that means their feelings are no more important to Hilton Family This is how the doubletree management team in Rosemead is taking care of the guests. Until now, nobody gives us any explanation for all of these and apology.  My husband and I travel often and we stay with Hilton Family, but we really spend a miserable stay at doubletree in Rosemead LA.In the end, I want to clarify it really not about where we come from, what color we are, or who we are, we paid the money, so we deserve equal treatment and respect. Each client is the reason why you still have the job. Maybe you don't care about losing us, losing one customer, but think about this, how many clients have you lost in the past few years and how many clients you are going to lose in the future because of poor management"

Loved the location of this hotel.  Went with another couplebooked two separate nights but had to cancel one due to change of plans.  Cancellation window is one month out  missed it by less than 24 hours.  Booking.com even tried to convince this racist miser to refund us the extra night but he refused  and quite rudely by tone of his emails.  Fine.  I accepted it as my fault.  I did not, however, cancel it as I figured if he would not refund my night stay, no way was I going to let him make money on another booking.  Well he did not like that.  Yelled at me when I checked in following night.  Also yelled at me because I tried to help young Korean woman who was attempting to check in ahead of me.  She was alone, crying, and using an app to try and communicate.  She was early 20s and so in over her head.  He told me he did not appreciate that I did not cancel night before and that my help was not wanted with this young lady.  Really  I am a mom of daughters.  I would hope that someone would try to console and reassure them if they had problem.  The room was TINY  not that we needed large room but not even space to open travel size suitcases.  And like previous reviews stated  toiletries and toilet paper left much to be desired.  Next day upon check out  was told again that my help was not appreciated and I was a ""typical American"" and to go back to TRUMPLAND!!!Quite honestly this host was by far the rudest I have ever encountered in my 50 years  and the most racist.  Interesting how he was so rude to the Asian guests, and American.  There are many options for lodging in this area.  This place should be at the absolute bottom."

And after couple of words We were told that veiled women are not allowed to go for swimming wearing swimming suits that cover the whole body as if I have to take off my hijab for a swimming experience !! This is really disappointing .. unprofessional and very racial !! I understand to put restrictions for swimming suits materials for safety reasons through pictures or so ..

Below are my reasons:1. The hotel is really far from the beach. You need to go with a car. Even the nice big pool is really far.2. I asked for a beach towel. I had a card from the hotel. The beach guy told me ""You came late. There are no more towels. Come tomorrow early""!!!!!  No comment3. My wife's friend was wearing a diving suit a Hijab. The beach management asked her to get off the water. They told her she has to wear proper swimming suit. So what is a proper swimming suit A bikini A wetsuit was designed to get into the water. They don't like her covering her hair,  this is called RACISM.4. The TV in the room is hanged in an unsafe position. My wife and I hit our heads hard. Even we had 2 visitors who had their heads hit because of the stupid position.5. At 12 pm I asked the reception to get me an extra pillow. He told me it's not possible because I am late. I have to ask in the morning.6. The next day in the evening, I wanted to pay so I check out the next day fast. The receptionist told me the finance guy left and I have to pay in the morning.7. For that price, there are no breakfast or dinnerSo for a hotel, the previous points are not acceptable. You can stay for half the price for other hotels in ras sedr directly on the beach rooms with breakfast AND dinner"

We had a very warm welcome and the room was good with pool view. Private beach with the decks is the definition of vacation for me any day and it's all well maintained here. People in the dining area were generally very helpful and throughout our stay we required some additional baby food to be made. They were very understanding and made all the baby food as we requested. Buffet had good varieties but the local food tasted better than the Continental they provided. It's a small resort and I wouldn't call it as a four star resort in terms of room and services. And what's with the racism. My husband and I were so amused at the way the dining staff neglected us when they were brownskinned themselves. We were not offered menu or coffee/tea at the table. It was like we were invisible when they promptly attended to white people. Lol. Some people do want to feel inferior based on skin color. You feel inferior all you want but don't think your customers are too. We are not staying for free in your hotel. I request the hotel management to educate the staff that no people are superior or inferior based on skin color or anything for that matter. It's high time to stop blaming white people for racism when they are generally very friendly with everyone. I would like to make a point that not all staff were acting weird but one or two, especially the ladies at the dining area. Other than that the stay was pleasant and I would like to thank all the kitchen staff who made sure to cook and provide baby food we asked for. They were happy to redo it if it was not the way we wanted."

This is the first time we  was on a honeymoon with the wife experienced racist treatment in Lanka at Temple Tree resort  spa.The place has great rooms, clean facilities, lovely beach. But discourteous staff and very poor service especially if you're brown skinned! We noticed this differential treatment not just towards us, but with other brown couples/families from india who were staying at the resort.Food was serviced late  white tourists who placed orders after us were attended to promptly. The hotel staff were constantly at the tables of foreign tourists and tending to their every needs, while we had to reach out to the staff on several occasions to attend to us for refills, food, etc.Would never want to visit this place again. Might rather stay at a mediocre facility where the guests are treated with care."

The only thing he would do, was try to walk me and my girlfriend up to my room, and then would not leave. He would look at us from a few feet away continuously, and it seemed like with the look on his face he was enjoying it a little too much. After what seemed like days, we were left alone, only to find out that we weren't alone, finding Moldy the black mold monster in the bathroom. There was enough black mold and bed bugs to fill Nick Searcy's basement, and we asked it to be cleaned up, two racist gypsies came up with one napkin. ONE napkin  Illiterate Gypsy   Cleaning crew.

When it was my turn to go back to the lobby and watch bags for our friends multiple people came with bags. They stated they were headed to the bar and the bouncer let them go. The only difference between the people allowed to go with there bags and us was we were black and they were white. Their employees are representative of their brand. I will never go there again.

The location, the view and the dcor of the hotel were definitely fascinating.  Not the staffs and the services though.By checking a 5star renowned hotel in the world, you know what youre anticipating of.  However, Im sorry to say that W Barcelona was a real disappointment.  Some of the staffs were indeed quite helpful, but some were not.  I did not want to put it this way, but were not certain if thats because were Asians, were treated quite differently.When we had breakfast at the caf next to the lobby, the guests in front of us Westerners were led and arranged with seats; when its our turn, were left on our own and had to find a table ourselves.  When we intended to sit at a table resided nearer to the pool, with the guests just left but not set yet, they asked us to move to another table set with less decent view.  OK, thats fine.  But when another group of Western guests showed up and did the same, the staff let them sit there and served them well!  I had no intention to associate this with racism but honestly, its very frustrating.  I have never confronted anything like this with hotels ranging from 1 to 5 stars, but this time, W showed me.Since it was our first time in Barcelona, we sought for tourists information at the front desk.  On the first day, the lady wearing a pair of optics was really sincere and helpful, but not really the case when it came to the rest of them.  Some of the staff tended to rush all the information as fast as they could, then stopped and stared at us, gave us a feeling let they just wanted us to leave ASAP and did not want to lend us a helping hand at all.  I didnt expect services like this from a 5star hotel!!  Far from professional.I will not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a 5star experience.  You can be treated way better with 1/3 of the budget elsewhere."

By 10.30pm she was literally slumped on the floor in a drunken stupour, and at one point I think she fell downstairs in the middle of the night. The whole place reeked of booze; it smelt worse than a pub. The owner kept trying to get into conversation about how much she hated black people only she didn't say 'black people' but used an abusive term and when told that we were not interested in her personal views stormed off muttering something about fing Jews, although since neither of us are Jewish I'm not sure if this was aimed at us or was just part of her drunken diatribe.

As a couple of reviews have noted, I was cornered for an hour, silently listening while she gave me the same rehearsed, racist monologue that she presumably gives every other guest. It was uncomfortable, upsetting and unprofessional. I was giving clear cues that I didn't want to be there  I eventually backed out of the door to get away. One minute we were talking about her dog and in the next breath she was giving me her opinion on muslims, ""EU workers"", gay people and more. Needless to say I did not ask for it.

The guy with the mustache was racist, together with the other staff members. First, they said that they gave out our key cards already, which we hadnt received. We told them multiple times we didnt have key cards, however they ignored us and said that they dont care anymore since they gave out all the key cards as far as they know. We were like refugees, sitting along the hallway, waiting for them to provide us any key just to open the door to our assigned room. I had to go down and argue with the racist guy and asked him of any proof that they indeed released the key cards to us, which they did not have, thus he searched his drawer, and IT WAS JUST RIGHT THERE! He didnt even bother to apologize for the inconvenience we experienced just because he couldnt care less about us and didnt exactly tried looking for the cards. We waited for almost an hour!Second, we always had breakfast at the 5th floor as that was the common area where we can eat. There was a microwave there as well as a refrigerator. My friends and I just bought bubble milk tea and when we entered the hostel, just before we got to ride the elevator, this racist guy again stopped us and shouted NO! NO FOOD OR DRINKS UPSTAIRS! I then told him that we were going to the 5th floor, but he still said no. I was confused and embarrassed because there were other customers there. I asked him where we can stay and he said outside. I asked him again if we can stay inside because it was raining, but he didnt answer me nor even look at me. He spoke immediately to another customer without even answering my question. I was dumbfounded on how we were treated. He seemed nice and polite towards other customers, but not to us. Now, the funny thing is, we stayed inside and continued drinking our milk teas, until 2 other staff members came to us and apologized. They mentioned that they were still cleaning the 5th floor thats why we werent allowed to go up. They told us that we can go to the 5th floor now, and stay there. And so, we went up, and there we saw our other friends, whom we asked about the cleaning excuse that the staff members told us. And behold, it was not true at all. Our friends were there for more than an hour already and no cleaning happened. We were made to wait downstairs for almost an hour before they realized that we were actual customers that hate racism and are frustrated with their service. It would have been a nice hostel but the service was certainly garbage! Racism and discrimination should never be tolerated! I would have enjoyed Taiwan if it were not for that racist staff guy with mustache!"

She and the Manager whom was African American told us that we could not speak Spanish in the lobby, again saying that we are in America. The white guest told us to go back to our country, back where we came from. She was also very racist towards my husband who is white, because he was married to an Hispanic . This IS my country where all of group of friends were born and our country that we Love and Respect.  We  called the police trying to get  our money back because the Receptionist refused to check us in.  We have never been to such a poorly managed  Hotel with  Racist guest checking in and much less an un trained, very unprofessional Racist front desk clerk.  I as well as my 9 friends will never ever stay at an Econo Logde again and only hope that the front desk clerk can be retrained to better service the Hispanic people, be retrained in customer service in all aspect of her job.  The Econo Lodge should NEVER close the office during the time when most people are arriving after a long trip.

Historic qualities!Racist!I'm an opera singer, so if a composer had a coffee at a hotel, I want to stay there. This one had the Mozart factor, so of course I wanted to stay. The staff were INCREDIBLE, and I found one of the three other woman motorcyclists in Germany. She was completely sweet and lovely!The bar staff were a bit condescending and disinterested, but we're a middleaged couple, and we're from San Francisco, so we felt right at home!This hotel is clean, wonderful, and wellsituated. The loud football celebrations happened outside our window and, because the hotel is so wellmade, we could close our window and it was a quiet sanctuary.A quiet sanctuary with superracist iconography that I didn't notice until I went to use the restroom. I guarantee you that no person of African descent was involved in the rebranding that happened just a few years ago. The hotel name is one thing. The choice to use African caricatures is another, and recent. While I'm sure the hotel will say that it's not racist and that that's not the intent, this is a dangerously tonedeaf and typical of such a homogenous area  white people telling people what is and isn't racist.If the hotel chooses to contact me, I prefer it to be by the staff member of African descent who was involved in the branding decision. Disappointing, but despite how wonderful this hotel is, I couldn't in good conscience stay here again. It's also encouraged me to add ""racist"" to my list of search words in finding a hotel; I only found one review that mentioned this.Kudos for a copy of the teachings of the buddha next to the bible.Breakfast was good."

But we are forced to have complimentary breakfast down in the basement with fellow Bangladeshis. I didnt think much about it before, and then I saw notice. The designated front cafe was reserved ""only for foreigner guests"" , I was outraged. What a Joke in 2017!! We paid the same hotel bills if not more and being treated like this in 2017  Are we bunch of cannibals/monkeys, who are not allowed to eat with foreign guests I would have given negative star if I was allowed.  Bangladeshis are fondly known all over the world for their hospitality.  If you start a chat with us, you will realise that People here are more accommodating and friendly than  a lot of uptight countries. We go extra mile to feel our guests welcome but certainly not humilating our own people. If you are visiting Bangladesh, please DO NOT stay in this sham hotel, If you want to experience rich local culture and heritage, there are lots of good ones out there."

The service from the male receptionist and brunette was disgustingly rude. The blond man at reception actually asked me: ""What is it NOW!!!!"" in a really rude and irritated way when I approached the counter to ask for help about something. I asked for directions to catch bus and tram to the city center, and he gave me incomplete instructions. He rattled them off like it was a speed contest and he left out a lot of necessary information. I ended up waiting 20 minutes waiting for a tram that never came because of the lousy instructions, and spent 15 euros on a taxi instead. Another time, I had to walk 30 minutes to get back to the hotel because of the lousy directions and I got lost. Getting information about anything from this receptionist was like getting blood from a stone. For example, how to use the internet in the lounge downstairs  there is NO FREE INTERNET in the rooms 10 Euros an hour in the rooms. He told me I needed a LAN cord and he was so unhelpful he didn't tell me they supplied LAN cords to guests. I was about to go out and buy a LAN cord, he was so unkind and uninformative. He seemed to want to get rid of me as quickly as possible. Also the brasserie is terrible. I ordered pasta and water. I paid 2 euros for a tiny glass of probably tap water and she didn't even bring the bottle. It was not mineral water. Then the pasta dish was so salty and I got food poisoning from it  abdominal cramps and diarrhea all night. If you are not a German or European, you will probably be given terrible treatment from the arrogant blond male receptionist and the stupid ditzy brunette female receptionist who couldn't even give me instructions on public transport to and from the city. The blond FEMALE receptionist was good though; she seemed the only one who wanted to help. WARNING: Don't go here unless you are a German and have a car. You will be treated like a leper for asking questions and will pay through the nose for something like a glass of water 2 euros for a small glass 60 mls of tap water and no bottle brought to the table.. . It made me really upset. Lost tons of money catching taxis and spent tons of time walking around lost trying to get back to the hotel. Only good thing about the hotel is the park setting including a lake with ducks which is good for guests with pets but be careful there is dog poo everywhere  I almost sat down on dog poo when I sat down on the grass in the park."

The only saving grace for this place was the port which is right across the street.From the minute we checked in,  the lady at the reception desk seemed to be in a terrible mood. It was as if she was offended at the sight of us. Not easy to describe but we were definitely treated differently from other guests. To confirm our belief the same lady blatantly told our agent that she does not wish to have any Indians in the hotel! When we asked for towels, we were literally reprimanded to not dirty them by taking it to the beachP.S.we did not spoil or misuse any stuff. So that piece of statement was totally unnecessary  Also, she was visibly irritated as we asked for fresh towels at 11:30 and the housekeeping staff wanted to give it at 12! I mean are we supposed to take shower at their convenience!!! Hahah terrible terrible terrible service. When we asked for a bottle of water to be sent to our room, it wasn't sent at all even after reminding twice or thrice. Apart from this horrendous experience, this hotel also does not have porter service or inroom dining service which is actually very important considering that it is located at a slight altitude thus making it uncomfortable if you are not in the best of health or have heavy luggage with you.When we asked for a glass of water at the breakfast buffet we were told very sternly that its chargeable. Ofcourse, no problem we will pay. Funnily, the same lady at the reception was very happily offered a glass of water to another guest even without asking because he looked tired. This hotel spoilt Mykonos for us."

Well let me start off by saying the beginning of our stay for Labor Day weekend started good, we were coming from LA and got there super early and was able to check in good the girl that checked us in was super nice and even helped us with downgrading one of the 10 rooms we had to a less expensive one per our request and got money back which was great!! On our 2nd day we went to the river so it was good but on our 3rd day the old lady watching over the pool was so rude to us she didn't want my daughter which is 18 to enter without an adult supervision, mind you she's 18 she is an adult well I got that taken care off besides the fact that the restrictions for the pool are beyond super stupid nothing at all like it says on their web site.  That same night we decide to chill at a bar with live music LORI was super nice at the beginning, my nephew was dropping money like a real high roller in the tables as he comes across one he's playing good but a guy with a TRUMP hat sits in the table and tells the dealer that he will not play unless my nephew who is black was removed, yes removed so he could play, well unbelievably the dealer asks my nephew to remove himself from the table because he could not play anymore, after that they began to give him a hard time getting his money only because he was black, he told me what happened and he left upstairs upset, I decided to tell LORI our bartender what happened and ask who could I speak to she was cool and said oh my that should never happen then I mentioned he was black and her coolness dropped from a 10 to a 3 she said oh your nephew is black im sure he did something wrong to our dealer I said NO he didn't she kept saying yes he did they all act crazy sometimes, I said let me speak to your manager, I spoke to another man bartender and he right away took care of business and told me I will get you the manager ASAP because that's not tolerated here, I was sent to AUDREY the Pit Manager who was understanding and right away after mentioning my nephews name she knew who he was and had already crossed words with him after he had lost 2500 the first night, and did mentioned he had been betting a lot of money over the weekend and the dealer had no right to kick him off the table only because someone did not want him there, although Audrey was nice enough to hear us out and seemed she would take care of it, I didn't feel like a simple ""he can play anywhere he wants"" was what anyone in my nephews shoes would of wanted, mind you he had gotten 2 rooms there and spending money like a high roller at least an I'm sorry would of been good, after all she did say ""we do know he's betting high in our casino on every table"" main point: I will never stay here again they are RACIST RACIST RACIST we had 10 rooms there!"

Hotel has a strict check in policy and you agreed to that but yet reached the hotel at 7pm and expected a warm welcome, meals and service Hotel would have to pay for the staffs to stay back just because of your inadequate planningNow back to the real deal of Bessho Sasa, its an premium level for housing guests on the level 3  4 of the hotel Kaneyamaen.When we were there, the upper levels were still under refurbishment but little disruptions to us.The magnificent Kyo kaiseiki meals if not appears hurried courses was served at a speedy pace was perfectly done and presented. It does not make the serving any slower even if you choose the option of 6:30pm or 7pm thinking the staffs might want to finish off early and head home into the night. Thats the reason for a four star grading cos kaiseiki is meant to be enjoyed course after course at your own pace and. It dictated by the servers.Taiku performance at main lobby was met with enthusiasm drummers who arranged the guests seats, rearranged back, host the bingo game every single night. We were there for two nights and each performances were done with immaculate precisions and synchronisation. After the performance, Bessho Sasa guests were also given drink voucher to be enjoyed with a live piano recital at 9:10pm every night. That was unspoken by lots of reviews and management and its a welcoming gestures. Though we thought its only a one time coupons, the family were presented another set together with the breakfast vouchers each day. We thought thats good hospitality! Breakfast was briefed to be crowded at 0800 but only 50 occupancy in the large dining hall, choose the corner of the dining area for a majestic morning view of Mount Fuji! You can skipped Cha do or Japanese tea ceremony at the tea house cos all the ladies did was to plonk your ready made green tea and dessert on your table and much leave you alone. An wonderful experience in Kyoto make up for their lackluster efforts in the tea house. Wonderfully manicured Japanese zen garden and a nature river at the back makes a beautiful backdrops to your holidays pictures. Theres a unmentioned open air tea garden where you can take pictures with a nice giant umbrella and a bold red cover on the seats making the dark and dull greens and backdrops a standup for your Instagram worthy pictures.Requests to use the shuttle service was a Breeze at our own personalised manned hotel desk on the fourth level. Names were submitted and driver were identify you though this service was not used frequently by Japanese who drove to the hotel. If you do see a Japanese man, hes always smiling and treated you as a distinguished guest even to the extend of sending you off at the lift. He works only 10001900 though. Lounge with average Japanese vineyard white wine and superb sparkling Japanese wine were provided together with the yummy mt Fuji green tea cakes and snacks were catered.

I have never heard of any hotel in the world that closes checkin Guests travel from all over the world, how can we ensure no flight delays to arrive at the hotel by 6pm Japan timeWhen we arrived at the hotel, the receptionists were therefore really pissed at us for arriving past 6pm. They gave a black face despite our apologies although I still don't understand how any hotel can close checkin and did not respond with any courtesy. When we asked for extra amenities in the room as I am travelling with my baby, the ""butler"" showing us to the room rolled her eyes. I can't even believe this.Breakfast in the hotel was a terrible experience. We received racist treatment, just short of chasing us out of the hotel.

This review is so late because I have been trying to get an apology/response from the hotel management but this has not been acknowledged.My boyfriend and I have lived in Japan for over a year and can speak a fairly decent level of Japanese. Despite this, we received a hugely biased and racist level of customer service from some staff members. Yes, the hotel room was beautiful and the onsen looking over the sea was great, but it was completely not worth the expense considering my holiday ended with the receptionist making me cry in the public lobby, due to his lack of compasion and hideous service. For example, when we wanted to be served, the receptionist just threw his hand up at us and pulled a stern face  an action similar that people usually use when communicating with their dogs. Yet, the following Japanese customers he was happy to serve with a smile.When we emailed the hotel about our experience , they would not acknowledge this at all. They stated they DO NOT have racist staff, and it was our problem for not understanding about Japanese food and culture. Clearly we do, and we usually experience fantastic customer service in Japan as the customer is always respected. It was an ignorant response from managment that are not able to accept their flaws and critisms.It's such a sad reflection of Japan when situations like this happen."

He is a black man in his mid 20's. The owner had accused him of stealing the complimentary coffee and despite being told that he was a guest by his concierge called the police.  In protest the concierge promptly quit and the cops couldn't believe that they had been called.  We were given our rooms for free but it does not excuse this type of profiling.

My experience at HomeBase Melville left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.  towards the end of March we parked outside homebase Melville and I went up to the gate and rang the bell and asked if they have space but immediately was told that they were fully booked for the rest of the week. I Went back to the car and my wife then suggested we ask the manager if we could use the wifi to look for another place to stay or if he could direct us or help us call another backpackers  to my suprise my wife who is a white woman was told they had accommodation  plenty  me being a black male realised the manager had told me they didn't maybe because i am black.We spent 2 nights there but only two as we felt uncomfortable after the treatment I had received from Bruce  then I see another review has gone up about his racist behavior... i am not a petty person and was willing to disregard this as a persons Bad day.in fairness i will still give this place a five star  rating, rooms were clean, pool, bar, wifi, receptionists were friendly and kitchen is wellequipped. Maybe the manager needs some sort of training, and having been robbed in sa already i can see why some establishments aren't willing to have locals. but it has to be handled better."

I checked in and I was immediately informed by Bruce the manager that they no longer take ""locals"" but because I had paid before I arrived I would be allowed to stay. My friend checked in as well and everything seemed to be okay, besides the fact that Bruce was very indifferent when it came to my friend and I, he hardly acknowledged our presence and made it a priority to monitor our interaction with the other staff. On the Tuesday of our stay as we were in the kitchen preparing to make supper for that evening, Bruce abruptly informed us that he needed to cook for other guests so we had better speed along our cooking, bear in mind that we had not even started cooking, we were still preparing to do so, he turned around and told Kristy the other receptionist that he had to eventually put his foot down. My friend and I were both in awe because we did not understand what he was referring to as the previous night we had cooked pasta which had taken us 45 minutes to prepare and we had cleaned up afterwards. Bruce took it a step further and came back into the kitchen and monitored our cooking, standing behind us, hands folded over his chest and waited for us to finish up whilst continuously sighing audibly. Bear in mind that my friend and I were gone as from 8 am till about 4:30 in the afternoon yet everytime we came back to the hostel we felt unwelcome. It got so bad that we started contemplating staying somewhere else because of Bruce's treatment towards us. What further upset me was the fact that he would monitor our interaction with the other black staff and make us feel guilty for merely conversing, another thing that really upset me was how he openly disregarded and humiliated the black staff at Melville, he would openly criticize Chenai in the presence of guests, he then also accused one of the cleaning staff of theft after the staff member submitted his resignation in which he attributed one of his reasons for leaving was Bruce. My friend and I were not the only people who complained about Bruce's racist treatment towards them, two other ladies that had checked into Melville a day before we were supposed to check out also complained about Bruce's racist behaviour and intolerance towards black people. I emailed the owner privately to inform her of this but she is yet to acknowledge my complaint. So if you are black and thinking of staying at Homebase I would suggest you don't as Bruce made it quite clear that he is not tolerant of black people, I would honestly suggest you look for somewhere else to stay as you will be quite unhappy and you will be made to feel as though you are a nuisance despite adhering to all the rules and settling your bill, Bruce and his equally racist son will make sure that your stay is horrible. Homebase Melville was such a better place when Vaughan and Jason were working there, the atmosphere has changed totally now that Bruce has become manager. To show his intolerance towards black people, he informed me that both  my friend and I were barred from every staying at HomeBase and when I enquired as to why he could not give me a straight answer as I informed him that I had transgressed any of the rules at HomeBase nor were there any complaints from my fellow dormmates about me but he took it upon himself to forbid me from every stepping foot at HomeBase. This was quite a disheartening and saddening experience."

I stayed at the  backpacker for 3 days. We paid our fees on time, and cleaned up after ourselves.  As an African American I have had to ignore ignorance, but never on this level.  Upon departure, my father asked if he could stay another night. I was positive it wasn't going to be a problem... surprise, surprise. The head manager claimed that the rooms were entirely booked, even though the place was entirely empty when we were packing. When I confronted the manager, he condescendingly drilled me with a series of personal questions. I was disgusted, angry and hurt. I talked to a gentlemen who later told me that they don't like to do business with ""blacks.""  I vowed to never go back, and to advise my fellow backpackers to be aware of the secret, separatist antics backpackers use when deciding who they rent to."

Avoid!","My husband and i had initially booked 3 nights and were taken to a very small room. We asked to be shifted to a bigger room with additional cost as we were planning to stay for 2 more days. We were given a twin rin on 4 th floors. Beware there is no lift so had to carry the bags to the 4 th floor. We knew that it was a budget accommodation so i won't moan about the quality of the room and bathroom.This was the worst accommodation i have ever stayed in in last 3 months traveling through South East Asia or even other parts of Thailand. On the second day of my trip I gave the key to the reception before going out for the day. When returned back at night the guy at the reception was rude to me and blamed me for losing the key. The next day i went through the cctv footage on the receiption area to make sure whether i had or had not lost the key. The footage was not clear one way or the other. The guy at receiption at the time said that i must have dropped it as the key ring was quite lose. We agreed that he will cut a new set of keys. For days my husband had been complaing that he was being bitten by some insect am over his body. We thought that it was mosquito bites till i discovered bed bugs in the room the day before we were to check out. My husbsnd rang the reception to report about it and ask if they would give us another room. Twice the guy hung up on my husband and finally he sent the cleansers to check if there were any bed bugs. We were shifted into another room for our last night there. When we were trying to check out the same rude guy who is at the receiption at night asked us to pay 500 baht for the keys they already had that amount as deposit for the keys and 450 baht for our room which we had to pay. We told him very nicely that 500 baht is too much to cut a set of keys. We were ready to pay for the keys even though it was not proved that we lost the keys. He kept shouting that it's the hotel's policy. We again vertu nicely told him that it'snot fair that he wants us to pay 500 baht. He got very aggressive and started shouting and kept saying, ""you leave from here you swear word go back to India and not England"" my husband and I are both British of Indian origin.There are lots of accommodation available next to this hotel at similar price."

After several pleas they fixed this issue.On the first breakfast of the stay the coffee shop staff began frantically exclaiming how we were Indians and we were to sit outside. This was being shouted in the middle of the coffee shop in front of tons of people. When we asked meet the GM, the staff claimed we couldn't reach the gm because he was on his weekend off. Finally Monday came and we complained to our staff in the middle of our tour manager writing frantic emails. The GM promised that the issue had been taken care of. We entered the coffee shop to take our breakfast and again the racist frantic shouting of Indians needing to sit outside began. When we protested and informed the staff of our discussion with the GM they began to wave their hands and walk in other discussion being extremely polite to others but being extremely rude to any Indians. When we called the staff and complained about our dirty cup, she came to our table and banged the cup and saucer and came back later to bang a spoon.We visited the GM to complain about this reissue and claimed he had no control over the staff because they were outsourced. Then we guided him to the concerned staff and she outrightly refused to take responsibility of her job, again shouting. On a lot of insistence from the GM she pretended to rudely apologize, still shouting in the middle of the coffee shop as if it were some favor to us.On tweeting about this issue the IHG says they're unable to reach the staff and have left a message and they'll get back. How is this racism continuing without checks in this Italian Hotel nobody can understand. Will definitely never visit this group of Hotels in the future."

Room quality is good and so is bathroom.  I dont really have much else good things to say about this hotel.  Location is very poor.  This hotel is only good for people who want to stay close to Fumicino Airport.  If you are flying to Ciampino or any other airport, its quite difficult to get here.  Let me tell you something more about location: there is no other restaurant nearby.  So you end up eating at their  restaurant which is very unreasonable  food vs price, especially if you have children.  They have this thing called ""children eat free"".  I was visiting with my family.  I asked for free children deal and the response was that I need to eat three/four course meal at 40/50 euros per head then children can eat for free.  Like most other family person, I dont allocate this kind of price for each meal.  Anyway, you end up buying adult main meal for children which is around 20 euros per head. Food was not tasty as well.  Children menu only has two meal: spaghetti with tomato sauce and the other with mince pork.  Breakfast is reasonable and children eat for free.  However I didnt go after just one breakfast.  Very few/small choices and boring food.  I dont want to pay 16 euros per head for very limited choices of food.One of the main reason I chose this hotel is because of the swimming pools.  They advertise by saying two swimming pools. I will call only one of them as mini swimming pool.  Other one is about the size of a small fish pond.  The mini pool was dirty and with cold water which I suppose is only good for FEW hours a year.  The hotel I suppose would be good for business visitors and are visiting nearby engineering companies like tecnip etc.  This is not suitable for family, nor it is suitable for rome sightseeing.  I did not feel secure at this hotel.  There was no safe at the room either. So I ended up taking my wallet at the sightseeing trip.  There are pickpocketers everywhere and they target all new visitors. As I was a victim of crime at this visit, I ask you to be very careful.  You are very likely to lose wallet at the metro.  Police is not doing anything to help, which leads me to believe that some are profiteering from it as well, at least some of them.  The path that leads from the hotel to the station is dark and isolated.  I did not enjoy walking via this road after spending days in sightseeing. STaff is reasonable but needs some lessons in customer service, racial education etc.  I am not going talk anymore in this topic.As a visitor of Rome for three times in last 15 years, I ask you to be near to city center.  Toilets in the city are virtually non existent and the bar ones are very dirty etc.  So if you stay in the inner city ones  one can be a nearby hotel for comfort and also you can somewhat avoid using metro etc.  I guarantee that you will enjoy your trip better.  Also you have time to explore and eat at various bars / restaurants which offer good food at good price.   Wifi is also badly advertise. Very poor signal."

If you want to enjoy a restful vacation away from the trappings of technology and stressful city life, Bob and Peggys Mountain View Resort with its spectacular views of pristine Lake Manitou is the perfect remedy to help you unwind.I'd like to address some negative reviews left by three previous guests that won't likely be allowed to stay at the resort ever again I'm sure in which they accused Bob and Peggy of rudeness, racism, and unfair rules.The false accusation of rudeness: One guest stated that the Hildebrandts offered a fire pit on the resort's private beach, but then these guests were denied use of the fire pit. That was due to the fire ban that was being enforced on Manitoulin Island at that particular time due to extremely dry weather conditions that greatly increased the risk of fires spreading into the heavily wooded areas from sparks and flames. When there was a fire ban in place, Bob and Peggy had no choice but to comply with those regulations and it's disappointing that those particular guests had no consideration for the safety of their hosts, other guests, or islanders when Peggy very clearly and courteously explained the conditions of the fire ban to them.The false accusations of racism and unfair rules: Another guest accused Bob and Peggy of racism which is utterly petty nonsense since nothing could be further from the truth. The Hildebrandts enjoy having guests of all races, colours, and creeds and race has never been an issue. The key though is guests have to be respectful of the hosts and of other guests on the resort. Ive found that those that obsess about racism and accuse others of racism are often racists themselves. Its not racist to enforce a fire ban in place, to ask guests to not throw rocks in the lake or in the dock area, to ask guests particularly children to not stand in boats used by other guests, to ask guests to kindly sweep and tidy their cottages before leaving, and to maintain some tidiness outside of their cottages for the benefit of other guests and the hosts trying to attract additional renters.Apparently, these three guests and/or other members of their family became so obnoxious due to not being able to use the beach fire pit and having to comply with some simple rules that other cottage renting establishments ask of their guests that they repeatedly paced around the Hildebrandts home and rang their doorbell hundreds of times to harass and intimidate the Hildebrandt family which is not an intelligent or civilized way to behave, least of all when one is a guest on a resort.Sadly now and then, Bob and Peggy have had to put up with some very spoiled entitled guests that are unwilling to respect a few simple rules and instead they prefer to make false, wild, irrational accusations against their gracious hosts.So, to sum up, I highly recommend spending a week or more at Mountain View Resort which will certainly help you feel refreshed. Remember that respect is a twoway street and Bobby and Peggy are always willing to make their guests stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible as long as their guests' expectations are realistic. The Hildebrandts are wonderful people and their cottages are some of the cleanest and most comfortable ones available on Manitoulin Island. Cherish your time there and have fun like my family and I have every single year! Thank you so much, Bob, Peggy, and Katie! All the best from Jon Hammond."

The front desk is extremely prejudice and racist against Black people. My significant other was treated very distasteful. I came off the elevator and the lady at the front desk was speaking to two other white guests , I stepped outside and forgot something so I came back in and proceeded to the elevator she then said Where u going Me being totally  confused I was like excuse me Im a guest here. So we went out and came back the lady at the front desk was in my room and went through my personal items. Then I had someone who was driving me come to pick us up and she told him he cannot wait in the lobby and to step outside. My significant other asked her what the problem was and she then said to him dont ask me anything!! At this point we were beyond confused. I went up to my room to get ready she then called the room and ask for someone to come to front desk immediately. My bf went down as I was still dressing he then calls me to say that her husband who works there as well said and Im quoting  I dont care  and check out immediately and that the lady at the front desk said my bf harassed her when my bf said to him well u have cameras check to see if I harassed her. He didnt care at all. I then came downstairs with my luggage and I put the key card on their desk the man then threw the key card at my bf head and proceeded to curse racist slurs at us. It was truly horrific and disturbing to see that in 2018 you cant even get peace of mind. I wont advise anyone to stay there. They are UNPROFESSIONAL and their service was in no way comforting. I dont like making things about race but I couldnt see any other reason why they would treat us so poorly and the racist comments made after he threw something at us makes it more so."

Beware,"I was travelling along with my younger brother and a friend to attend Pushkar fair. After reading through reviews of quite a lot of budget hotels, I chose hotel moonlight. As the owner ""Joshi Ji"" says that ""Ask anywhere in Pushkar about him, that he is so well known. true but for wrong reasons."". After travelling from Delhi to Pushkar for the entire day, we were excited to find the hotel and check in the room. To our surprise we were asked to remove our shoes and the owners brother ""Vikram the most rude person I have met in the hospitality trade"" banged the door on our face saying that we have to keep our hotel clean so stay out. He was busy with some disastrous incense sticks in the lobby which is dark and gloomy like any ""RED LIGHT AREA"". He said there is a booking but of the next day not the day we reached which was a blunder made by him and the owner. He wasted our 02 long hours in arguments and was not even apologetic. I looked for another hotel and asked him to offer a complementary dinner to us. The owner moron Joshi agreed and asked for our favourite dish to be prepared. We simple asked for good food and no such special arrangements to be made. After visiting the fair, we went for a dinner at his hotel and Vikram said ""Are the guests Indians or foreigners"" He dos not entertain Indians  and is a racist.. Again as he misbehaved, he back stepped saying ""I will not provide you with the dinner"" which is more than the cost you have paid"". Please beware of this hotel and the owner.

Avoid at all costs if you abhor racism. I have better places to waste my money on!"

When my partner and myself arrived at this hotel after already paid for a booking and arrived to the reception we were informed that I would be required to pay an additional fee due to my ethnicity... Even though we had already booked and paid for the room the staff demanded the extra payment on arrival this is extortionate. The fact that the scam is racist made my day."

When we first went in the lady at reception seemed angry but I wasn't sure why. I found out afterwards that she was calling me American and saying she didn't want me in her hotel, lobby, or anywhere near it. I'm not even American, but I don't know what she was trying to protect. After staying there for one night I'd imagine she should be trying to get all the business that anyone is willing to give her because this place is a total dump and the cleanliness of the rooms is truly sickening. I'd be embarrassed to bring a 10 cent hooker to this dump.The walls looked like someone flung mud all over them and no one bothered to clean them. The drawers were loaded with rat crap. The washroom has a window looking clearly into it and anyone over 6 feet shouldn't have a problem glancing in while you're doing your business. And finally the beds are harder than the floor.Finally the price was OUTRAGEOUS. 600,000 VND a night for this. I'd rather pay 600,000 a night to stay at the local landfill.Do not go unless you want to be treated poorly but the racist reception and overall have the worst hotel experience you can get."

Still, this hostel has a very dirty kitchen, a rundown appearance holes in all the shoji/paper doors, doors barely move, and just gives off a shabby feeling. Feels like young guys hanging out there, and financing their hanging out by barely managing a hostel.While I might have been there at the wrong day the staff who was there said he's only filling in once every two weeks, my experience in this hostel was awful. Short version, hostel staff unable to provide instruction for parking, then unable to get me past a racist parking guard.Long version. Across very little to no English, I finally got a room booked which was not ready yet, fair enough as it was before official checkin time. Then I tried to park next to the hostel, there is a very big city owned parking for 300yen/day, which is very cheap. The parking guard obviously doesn't like Gaijin, and just didn't want to let me enter. Lied to me and sent me around the block searching for another parking. I got the staff to translate, guard said I can't park here because it's election Sunday tomorrow, but there's another parking for the same price more lies. I drove around with the hostel guy in my car, he finally had to admit the guard lied. But he didn't want to confront him about it. I asked the hostel guy if he knew another parking which is not too expensive. No idea. Asked him if he can call anyone who knows. Stammering, but no action. So I finally let the hostel guy run, and parked the car for 100yen/20min, went to the hostel, talked to Japanese traveller who HAD parked his car there, but didn't want to talk to the parking guard either. I talked to the hostel guy again, he finally said all people usually park there, and that the parking is not guarded over night. So I parked there over the night. Left early. Came back for an errand, parked at the side of the road, the parking guard comes running, ""600 yen! Yesterday 300 yen! Today 300 yen!"", he obviously saw my car on the parking lot. So I tell him that he should let me in next time, and I will gladly pay then. He doesn't understand English, I don't understand Japanese. He's trying to keep me from leaving, by force. When I get in the car, slams the windows with his fist. He's also 2 heads shorter than me, 15 years older, wears glasses and is intellectually challenged. Can't hit that. His guard friends stand around, do nothing, and want to be elsewhere. So I open the window, try to shoo him off. At this point he's shouting ""No! No! No! 600 yen! No!"". Crazy. He starts grappling again. I've had enough, shake him off, drive off under blows against the windows and threats. I stop at a traffic light, think about it. It's 6 bucks, and he's got my licence plate. Are the police going to be fair to a foreigner I drive back, tell him what I think of him in my native language, and want to pay the 600 yen. He seems somewhat remorseful for completely losing his Japanese public face, leads me to the hostel, the guy in the hostel not the one the day before has obviously paid him the 600, so I now have to give HIM the 600. I tell him the story, but he has nothing to say, really. Obviously still too afraid to say anything that could lead to conflict with the parking guard. I understand you need to keep up Tatemae. But the parking guard didn't, and it was clear for everyone to see that he was just racist. To then NOT do ANYTHING about it if you're hostel staff and you have paying guests, that's not Tatemae, that's just cowardice and bad service."

Hope Tina is not the owner","I stayed in this hotel last month. I booked for 3 nights under my employable discount. Once I got to the hotel ready to check in, I was ready for bed. I was told that I am not able to stay there because this has to be for BUSINESS ONLY!!! WHAT YOU are so wrong. I have stayed as a choice employee many times. In town and out of town. I am manager at a near by hotel.. She did not know that. I have a personal relationship with the owner of my hotel and Senior VP of my hotel. So called both of them very upset and explain what my issue was and they were also upset. As I explained how this front desk person treated me and this front desk persons reaction to my explaining that she is racist she  the front desk person did not defend herself at all to say she was not racist. I called Choice and explained my issue. After 2 calls to choice and being the lobby standing up and being on hold while they try to convince this ignorant women to allow me to check in and tell her she is wrong for thinking that you can only use yor Choice employee discount if you are on business..  which I know she knows this already she allowed me to check in. By the way the front desk persons name is TINA!!  Tina then cancelled my 2 other nights without even telling Choice or telling me. I had to asked her. Tina is very uneducated and unprofessional. Not to mention she was dressed like she was a person off the street with jeans and a loose tee shirt on. I will never recommend this hotel to a homeless person to stay. Id rather stay on the streets then to ever feel the way she made me feel on this day. I have never had racial contact in my face like it was on this day!! I did stay here because I work in the area and needed to get back to work that night. NEVER AGAIN!! IF YOUR ARE BLACK NEVER STAY HERE!!!"

We had a reservation for a room for 2 nights, booked at a discount because I am also a Choice employee. First time I booked the room the GM cancelled it without any kind of provocation! I checked my reservation the day before I was supposed to check in and it had been cancelled for absolutely no reason. I booked another room, and upon arrival was told that I would not be allowed to check in because my friend is not a fellow Choice employee!! I have had many friends and family stay with me in my Choice employee discount rooms, I have NEVER been told I couldn't have a room because of the person I would be sharing it with. We ended up leaving and going to a Quality Inn down the road, where the front desk agent told us that they are notoriously racist people. My friend who was checking in with me is black. I fully believe we were denied a room because the awful woman working the front desk is a racist. I have NEVER encountered a staff of people so incompetent, unhelpful, and rude!!! DO NOT STAY HERE! I have never felt so disrespected as I did talking to the staff at this motel. STAY FAR AWAY!!! "

It's the worse customer service!! I felt so abused and violated of my human rights. Do not stay at this place. Because the owners running this place are absolutely racist. We arrived into Wellington Porirua this morning after a long 12 hour drive from up North. Unfortunately, where our church group was booked up the road was fully booked. So me and my partner were forced to find somewhere else to stay. Due to the large conference happening this weekend, it was hard to find something available. I called Belmont lodge, a man answered and sounded very polite on the phone. I asked for a room for two nights and two adults, so he then continued to reserve the room, I then added Im checking in my family to a different motel but we will be in shortly to finalise our reservation. We arrive to the motor lodge, and female her name was Suzie comes out of the office and says looking at me up and down, can I help you I say to her, yes I called about the room earlier. Out of no where with not even asking, she says we have rules of guests staying here, and I then say that's fine. My dad will be paying the room, and she says there's a bond. I continue to say, I will pay the bond. She goes on to say all this information, in the meantime my dad says his going up the road  she abrupts says to me. She has decided to refuse my booking, and not allow us to stay. I then say why, she says because she has the right to refuse me and my partner staying there. I said to her in shock are you being racists. She says no, I then said, are you always this rude I will make a formal complaint. Not to mention I am heavily pregnant, and she just right denies me the room because of the way I look and the fact I said I would pay the room and bond separately. I said we want to stay here and you've just said you will not allow us. You must be rasict because you can't me an explanation of any sort to why you will not allow us to stay here. She led on to say, she wasn't racist but still couldn't explain why she refused the room. She made me feel like we couldn't afford the room, and we were hooligans and were out to ruin the room but yet we were only standing in the reception area waiting to confirm the booking. Racist or NOT, I felt violated and abused especially being someone of colour who is 6 months pregnant who just needed a room to sleep in to rest after a 12 hour drive. IT was only me and my partner in the car who needed a room as my parents and all our friends had booked out the Mana Motel. I couldn't believe in all my years, the treatment I was receiving from this lady who is the owner Suzie. She could NOT once give me a clear explanation why she refused my booking on the spot. I have witnesses to prove this behaviour of this lady. My parents couldn't believe the she denied me a booking considering how nice and calm I was being to her. NOT ONCE did I swear or yell at her. All I kept repeating was the truth ""why are you being rude, why are you being racist and why are you refusing a booking with no explanation""....To be honest, from looking at the other bad reviews of this lodge, is seems like a common factor in the bad reviews. She clearly has customer serivce issues. She shouldn't have a lodge in Poririua even she doesn't accept the kind of population Poririua has. My experience was the worse in all my years!!!! I will never stay here again!!!"

While checking in she was very clear of the rules which is fine, mean while I advised that we were visiting Wellington to attend the NZ Womens Basketball Championship at Te Rauparaha Arena.  At the end we enquired about how much it would be for a bigger room but was given the price and decided against it.  We walked to our room, on the way grabbing two extra towels.  5mins later we had a knock at the door and she said ""We have a problem here, I don't believe there are only two people staying here"", we explained that indeed there were only two people staying in the room and our three family members who had come with us to check in already had accommodation in Stokes Valley and we were simply 'relaxing' before the game in two hours 3pm after walking and training from Wellington City with our luggage. She then questioned why we needed extra towels and we explained it was because we were going to have a swim at the Arena after the game, she said we weren't allowed to take the towels offsite so I asked if she wanted them back but she kept accusing us of trying to sneak extra people in, it was only 1pm and she did explain that we were allowed visitors until 9pm but no matter how much we explained the situation she wouldn't let up.  By now my sister who saw her pulling faces behind my back had had enough and responsed sharply to all the questions and accusations she threw at us, she then suggested we move on because she was getting attitude.  We must of been having this conversation with her for 10mins repeatedly justifying ourselves, she went on to insinuate that we couldn't afford to stay at such places and after the reception and such comments we decided to leave and get our money back .....For the fact I do stay at such places several times a year, mostly always for sports trips and I have never experienced anything like this.  Later my sister told me what she did behind my back and I now believe it was because I'm brown and she's racist!!"

I am in communication with Hilton headquarters in the USA, where I reside  to submit a formal complaint.The residence, staff and services at the resort were all excellent, aside from the GM. The wonderful staff excluding the RACIST GM even called me while I was on the way to the airport, to return my wallet which contained several hundred Euros, as I had forgot it when I checked out. I could not have asked for a better staff, services and accommodations  except, of course for the General Manager.As previous guest  jeansolme  stated, the incident on Saturday, 26 January 2019 sadly showed that the racist General Manager improperly targeted the bartender, named Hamilton  a professional local St. Lucian who did not deserve this improper treatment.Let me describe my experience:On the morning of Saturday, 26 January 2019, I had a lovely breakfast with my friends local St. Lucians at Julia's restaurant in the hotel. Perfect service. Upon return to my room, I requested that Hamilton the bartender, bring up to my room one cocktail and a bottle of water. He brought the items and also assisted me with the television which was not properly functioning throughout my stay  and then exited my room. Approximately 5 minutes later, the General Manager, who I now know to be Jean Pierre, a white French man, aggressively knocked on my door with another security man. I was packing, in my bathrobe and was quite frightened. I am a solo woman traveler and I take my safety very seriously.This GM was a complete bully and demanded to know where the bartender was. I was shocked at his demeanor and boorish behavior. I told him that the bartender had left and I had no idea where he was. The GM was so aggressive that I feared for my safety.As I mentioned, I am in communication with Hilton headquarters in te USA. I have never in my life experienced such horrible behavior from a GM. I will keep you all posted with the results of this investigation."

The floor manager, who was also in chefs clothes, was the most unprofessional hospitality guy I am yet to witness.

When we wished to understand the pricing quoted on the bill this dish isnt even mentioned on their restaurant menu, he behaved in the most unprofessional way, pointing fingers while talking, rude behavior and not hospitable at all.

After seating ourselves again, no menus were offered again and we were asked to move to another table  which was located in a muddy grass patch. When we refused, the waiter shouted and responded rudely. At the same time, a white family arrived and again, better service was offered including being chauffeured to a table and provided menus. My partner asked to see the manager and we were told he's ""outside"". We asked that the rude waiter apologise for his behaviour but was refused a simple apology too. There was an obvious difference in service offered to white and nonwhite customers which was potentially the most frustrating part of the experience since we're all darn paying customers.

The members of staff were frequently making racist comments towards our group calling us stupid english people and muttering slurs under their breathe in French not knowing that a lot of us actually speak the language.There was no hospitality at all. We had a check in time at 1pm and had to wait a further 30 mins to collect our key cards, which of course was fine. The lady came and and gave half of our group the keys and said there were no more rooms and we would have to wait until the evening. She wasnt apologetic in the slightest and looked like we were just a massive inconvenience. When we arrived back at the hotel at midnight ready to collect our keycards and go to bed when the lady said they key cards hadnt been programmed to our rooms yet. 20 of us were waiting for another hour to finally get our key cards, 12 hours after we were suppose to check in. When we finally were given key cards half of them were for rooms that were double booked and some of the group walked into people in their beds! Personally it took me a further 2 attempts to go back to the incredibly rude lady at the desk to get a room, however some of my colleagues had to try four times.The three rooms I saw were okay, would have been better if there were less strangers belongings and strangers in them.This is by far the worst service I have ever encountered. In the short time we were there it was actually pretty impressive how rude, racist and unprofessional the hotel staff were! If I could give 0 stars I would."

The quality of the hotel is extremely poor. Filthy carpets no space to move around the rooms. Shower stalls were on concept with water all over the washroom floor. What's worse the tall woman who supervised the cafeteria was racist and rude. When confronted seemed to just laugh it off. With her attitude, she is more fit as a prison warden rather than in an hotel cafeteria. Many in our group  noticed how she treated some clientele from European countries with added courtesy. Even the hotel manager was introduced to the European clients, however when she pointed to the leaders of our group he rudely waved his hand to say he was not interested and walked away. My review will also be sent to Purple Orchid, the organizers of our trip. We do not pay good money to be housed in cheap lousy hotels like this one. And oh, by the way making clients stand in a long line up to make their own coffee with just one coffee machine is absurd."

As you can see from the reviews on here, which she only responds to if negative, she is somewhat aggressive and invasive with guests. Her response to the other review from our group is both inaccurate and lying. One of us ordered linens before we arrived none of us afterwards. It was me that she picked on from the moment we met. When I walked into the kitchen she immediately made fun of the fact that I still looked a little tired and worn out, which is strange seeing as I had just showered. Two sentences later she starts staring at me and says 'somebody owes me 3 for bed linens.' I looked for some money, but didn't have enough and stated this. She keeps staring future note for when you read this: it is polite to say at that point; It's ok, just make sure you give it before you leave. and just stood there saying nothing. After getting the cash of the other members of the party I looked at her whilst putting the cash in her hand. One coin dropped by mistake and she was still staring at me in a discomforting way then says 'thank you, to which I looked her in the eyes politely and said 'you're welcome.'  Somehow she took offence to this and retorted 'Of course I am, I do own the place.' Not wanting to get annoyed by her demeanour, I decided to go and stand in the other room to remove myself from the tense atmosphere. She then followed me and some other guests there and started a very patronising lesson about the recycling which was not needed considering the number of signs explaining this. As I was not feeling in the mood to respond to such behaviour I didn't neither did anyone else in the group. This is when she got very strange, putting on a slow and deliberate accent and stating loudly 'DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH' I was absolutely shocked by this behaviour and even if I was not a mixed race individual it would still be racially offensive. From what I can understand looking through other reviews and from the other guest in our party, you don't take to criticism well. With that in mind, I ask that rather than use negative energy trying to send abusive emails to me, to call me or even deny things on here, take one of those 1000000000 Bibles you have on the property and read the sections on respecting your fellow humans regardless of who they are. You have a few things to learn in this area. "

The location is very convenient and the facilities are ok. The place is clean enough with an acceptable amount of resources compared to the average hostel in the UK and I have been to many. Unfortunatley, you will not be able to avoid the owner completely so you may well be better off paying a little more for a friendlier place or paying less at the campsite.You would be more likely to find Stella's attitude and communication style in a prison than a hostel. She was cold, condescending and strict right from the start. It is understandable that a hostel would need certain rules, but the emphasis that she places on them and the severity ascribed to them are very odd indeed. Another reviewer said that she is respectful if you respect her, but this did not hold true in our case. She came at us with a confrontational attitude right from the start despite our politeness. She seems to have the impression that she is doing guests a favour rather than them being paying customers. Here is just one example from moments after she met us, whilst we were cooking breakfast, hungover: Stella: Give me the 3 for the bedsheets now.Guest: Ok, hold on, here you go.Stella: Thanks.Guest being polite: You're welcome.Stella stern tone and smirking: Of course I'm welcome! This is my place.A short while later, she did a racist impression:Stella: asked a question once which I cannot rememberGuest who is clearly not white: no answer as he did not hear herStella Indian accent and tilting head from side to side: Excuse me, you speak EnglishMe utterly shocked: Don't be racist! Stella got in my face and smirked: Aww, you're sensitive aren't you It's not racist.This of course set off a big argument in which she would not accept any responsibility for her rudeness. Trying to ridicule someone white or not with a stereotyped foreign accent as if they are stupid is apparently not racist in her book. I guess the Katie Hopkins fans out there may agree with her. But, even without that label, it was incredibly rude and aggressive.Luckily, despite her disgusting attitude, we managed to have a great time. That does not say anything about the hostel itself though."

When we arrived, at evening time, we decided to stay despite the fact that the place looked substandard. It looked like an old lady was making money by renting rooms in an illegal place it is not registered / bounded by Indian laws. The place is dirty. The bathrooms are not clean. The room was ok for one night but not worth its price.She asked for us to go out to make copy of our ID, which is normally her duty. She gave and had no receipt for the payment we did on our arrival. She kept asking where we were from, how long we knew each other.We had finally been relaxing for 10 minutes when her son came into our room to ask for more money, pretending he had to pay some commission to the website. It was a complete lie, just a way to ask for money he knew it was late to find a place for the night or make us get out of there, as he said racist things against my bf to his mother saying ""he will do bad things"" and that foreigners were not allowed to stay with Indians in his place, and more nonsenses and racist attitude.Very dishonest. Super bad attitude. Bad place with no good environment. Illegal.Don't ever go there."
Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg304551d1915011r371726374EverGreenGuestHouseNewDelhiNationalCapitalTerritoryofDelhi.html,Date of stay: May 2016,Ever Green Guest House,Asia,India,National Capital Territory of Delhi,unknown,Best place in Pajar Ganj,"Man, what a place. The family here has been taking care of their little slice of Pahar Ganj for 40 years, so they know a thing or two about the business. The old lady who runs the place goes by Mamaji, and she will definitely treat you like a mother while you are here.I moved from another hostel nearby, Kuldeep Friends, because this place was just so much more superior.First the cons. For me, these didn't make much of a difference, but for others it may, depending on your lifestyle. They do not have attached bathrooms, the bathrooms are separated from the bedrooms by an internal courtyard bring your own soap! But they have towels for you. The bathrooms also contain squat toilets, so if you have weak knees, you're in for a challenge.I've been drinking the tap water located at the sink in the courtyard haven't gotten sick so far, it's been a week and a half, but if purified water is something you're adamant about, you'll need to buy some bottles of it in the road next to the guest house.Those aspects aside, I cannot think of any reason to not stay here if you're visiting Pahar Ganj or Delhi. The metro rail is a 10 minute walk away, and you are 3 minutes' walk from the main street of Pahar Ganj where you can grab rikshaws and autos local taxis. Transportation to the rest of the city is no problem whatsoever, the location is good enough for that.There is no food served the kitchen is mostly for the family who maintains the place, but you're in the middle of Pahar Ganj! There is so much food just on the street right outside, including a veg dhaba across the street with decent prices 110 rs will net you two dishes and a couple rotis, enough to enjoy a filling meal at the end of the day. There's lassi stands, a couple bakeries one Indian and a couple Western or ""German"", a fruit stand nothing beats a plate of watermelon for 20 rs, all cut up and fresh, and a few Bengali/Assamese restaurants if you crave seafood. If none of these local places meet your fancy, you're a walk away from the main street where there are more places to eat, including a Subway.Smoke stands are also right outside, and you can grab some bottled water at these places too. If you're looking for a place to drink, there is a cheap bar Sam's, happy hour is until 5:30 in the afternoon near the main street of Pahar Ganj, a 3 minute walk from the hostel. It's also a great place to bring friends and to use as a meetup location.The open courtyard is wonderful to sit in and read, smoke, or chill with other guests. You can drink as well beer, and there are a couple thekas, or alcohol stores, up the street from the hostel. It's easy to grab a little something and bring it back to your room.A big plus for this place is that Mamaji is very open about having visitors and guests over. I have a few friends who would like to regularly visit me from around Delhi, and the fact that they can come for five minutes or five hours, hang out in the courtyard or in my room, and even sleep over if they need to, is very liberating. Pretty much every other hostel or hotel in Pahar Ganj, Much less the entire city of Delhi, explicitly prohibits guests and friends. Some are racist even against other Indians and don't allow Indian friends or guests to come visit you. And nearly all are sexist on top if it and especially won't allow any local female friends to come visit. Yet these same places take female foreign guests and allow patrons to have foreign female friends over. It makes no sense to me and disgusts me, the double standards one finds in Delhi hostels and hotels.But Ever Green is DEFINITELY not at all like that. Mamaji is cool with everyone, true to her Sikh creed. And it's that aspect of her and her hostel that I think stands as a testimony to what kind of place you will be living in and what kind of people you will be dealing with by coming here.For your spiritual needs, there is a masjid and three to four mandirs within five minutes of the place. Not sure if there is a gurudrawa nearby, but Mamaji is Sikh so she will know I'm sure.So for the decent rooms for the price offered 300400 a night, the wonderful location with plenty of dining options around, places nearby to grab water, alcohol, medicines, toiletries, and the absolute 100 freedom you have with guests and friends coming over is why I must wholeheartedly recommend Ever Green.P.S.: the place does have free wifi. They shut it off around 11:30pm the router is located in Mamaji's room and she goes to sleep around then and it usually is back up by 9am, but that's enough wifi during the day. If you're here as a tourist, your days ought to be so packed that you'll doze off by midnight anyways!"

But here comes the story Weeks before our arrival I called the hotel twice and ask them if there was any charge for packages, to females told me that there were no charges for packages unless they arrive a week before my reservation and that in those cases they will charge a fee per day on each package. We finally started with the check in and I asked them if they already had my packages I got two delivered by that point and I was shocked when they told me I had to pay from 10 to 20 dollars depending on the wight of each one Even more than the cost of the item in one of the packages I told them I called to confirm and here is where everything started this people has no idea of how to treat customers, they show me a sign that was inside the hotel that described the charges and I kept trying to explain them what I was told over the phone. The lady decided to call another guy that was there I assume it was the manager because it was dresses different than the others he is the most racist and rude person I have ever met, I felt very mistreated about his tone of voice and his body language he even make fun of me when I was trying to explain him the situation and did nothing to solve the issue, not even apologize and instead offered me to go somewhere else If I wanted to. I can tell you that if my reservation wasn't already paid by then and an earlier time I WOULD DEFENETELY would go to another place. The fact that this hotel is a low cost hotel does not have nothin to do with the way I am expecting to be treated and It felt horrible to be in a Foreign country visiting and to be treated in this manner, I think this is horrible for Rosen image and I am hoping that you can take actions about this. Hopefully I did not see them for the next days, but I do regret a lot that I didn't ask for their names. The day we check out we did met a guy named Chris he was the only person in the reception who actually treated us with respect and was actually very nice, if it wasn't for him I would be even more dissapointed about the people they hire in this place."

Housekeeping services were below par, the towels were yellowed and smelly, the bathrooms were also not clean and the bath mat not changed daily despite being wet.  The rooms were only swept and floor not cleaned sometimes. The hotel wifi is erratic and remained so, the time I was  there.  I resolved to using my data bundles out of frustrations.  The meals were not to expectations as well and were not that tasty, I think they had overstayed in the freezer.  The hotel run out of essential food such as breakfast most mornings and one morning we were told the supplier was late.  This meant we missed our favourite food.  The bar service for all inclusive did not include popularly taken drinks and we were left with limited options or going back to our pockets to enjoy our favourite drinks. We felt that the facility was outstretched by all means; staff, food including utensils, our last night for dinner we had to wait for other guests to finish their meals to have free plates.  Staff did not seem motivated and I sensed racial discrimination,  which is improper in this day and age.  Overall, the hotel services are rated mediocre."

The employees was being racist, something NO child should go through especially as a family trip!!!! The employee male looked right at my son speaking to him in spanish that there were NO restrooms. Very rude, my son dis not even ask for a restroom actually we had just walked in for a reservation. The room was filthy, the headboard had obvious fingerprints/handprints. We did not shower that night, i went ahead and stayed elsewhere at the last minute. The tub was disgusting with mold and I made it clear to my kids not to touch anything!!! We tried our best to get to that room late so that we can just get there and fall asleep since it was very gross!!! This is our first and last time we will stay there, I dont care how bad I need a room, I will rather stay to sleep in my own vehicle. It all started with the racist male employee there!!!"

BEST EXPERIENCE!,"Do NOT believe the ONE terrible review from a 1time poster on Trip Advisor!  I am shocked to read that negative review because I found the owner to be caring and helpful and interested in me as a guest.  And coming from Japan, there was ZERO hint of racism!!  The owner actually Googled my city in Japan and made comments and asked questions about Kobe.  She was genuinely interested in where I was from!  Her daughter is a teacher in Germany and she told me about her and asked about schooling in Japan.  She was the most helpful hotel owner/manager of my entire trip in Germany for almost 3 weeks!  I am the FIRST person to pick up on racist things when traveling and there was NOTHING racist here.  I have around 140 reviews in August 2015 and not all of them are rave ones.  I will post a few negative comments about my Germany trip but nothing bad about the Grimmelshausen Hotel.One example of kindness that I witnessed was when two men who were not staying in the hotel wandered in at about 10 a.m. and inquired about having breakfast there.  I knew that the owner/manager had plans that morning shortly after breakfast and I could tell that she hesitated at first but having good businesssense, she invited them in to stay.  These two men were Spanish speakers so I am not sure if a racist owner would be so interested in Japan and then so kind to two Latin men non guests who showed up 5 minutes before the end of the breakfast time meant for hotel guests.  She welcomed them and chatted with them just as she did every day with all of the guests in the breakfast room! The breakfast selection was very good and they offer to cook eggs to order like other hotels.  I am pretty sure that I finished all of the homemade plum jam in 4 days from the 2014 harvest.  The bread was fresh and delicious!  I am guessing it came from the bakery across the street but don't know for sure.  The meat  cheese selection was also great.  I spent 4 nights here and I had a double room for single use.  I found the room to be very big and very very clean.  I am from Japan so I am used to smaller accommodations.  The room was NOT expensive and I had a flat screen TV and a room safe!  This was the only hotel with a room safe during my trip.  The bed was fine.  Nothing luxurious but I am not a great sleeper so I shouldn't say too much.  I do think it is odd that seemingly ALL German hotels do NOT put a top sheet on beds!  I need to have my feet tucked in at the bottom so it was hard to get used to a blanket on top of a mattress and just a fitted sheet.  That was in EVERY hotel though.  The bathroom was BIG and very very clean.  And the towels were great for this type of hotel in this price range.  I had towel issues in my next hotel so looking back, the towels here were like the Four Seasons, comparatively.  The housekeeping women were friendly and kind too.  Always sincere greetings which felt like home.  The manager/owner also called me by name from the first day.  This was the ONLY hotel where someone did that in Germany.  That is the type of service that I received when I stayed in the Four Seasons in Dublin, Ireland or other 5star hotels in the past.  The Japanese Yen is not as strong these days!  :The owner also suggested great daytrip ideas to me when I was looking to leave town for the day or half day.  And she would ask the next morning about how my trips were.  Budingen was an easy half day trip and I highly recommend it.  It is a beautiful little town only a couple train stops away if you are not driving.  I was traveling by train and I managed to find the hotel without a problem.  It was only about a 10minute walk and convenient for my two day trips.  I did it with a medium sized suitcase and a rolling carryon bag and it was not too taxing.  The hotel is just at the start of the hill so just when you start to regret the walk and question why you didn't take a taxi, you will see the hotel on the right.  A sure relief.Fulda was my fullday trip and I enjoyed that city a lot too.  It was further but the train ride was scenic.  I wouldn't go there on a Monday if you plan on seeing the inside of the palace there.  Monday was my only free day so I did it and there was still plenty to see without that museum.  The Grimmelshausen Hotel cannot be beaten for such good rates and service. Almost forgot, this was also the best hotel for free wifi.  I had so many problems in my other Germany hotels with the alleged ""free wifi in every room."" The owner also recommended a great cafe for CAKE!  So grateful for that suggestion!  I went there twice and wanted to go a 3rd time but didn't have time.  :   Pretty garden in the back where you can sit if you don't mind chainsmoking people blowing filthy smoke in your face.  The inside has great seating too."

Opening the windows  the only way to cool down as the radiator literally could not be turned off or even down  meant I was badly bitten by fearsome mosquitos, the scars from which are still with me after two weeks!.Locationwise its stunning as many have pointed out, the clockwork funicular down to the lake is charming, the waterfall energising, the lake view from our window was fabm and the October air was rather pleasant even if the narrow, windy road up and down seems like a death trap to those unused to alpine mountain etiquette.But no .. on our last night we were sat behind a shockingly arrogant Germanspeaking couple whose parenting skills didn't extend, it seems, to taking a continuously screaming/squealing infant to bed, but rather sat themselves in the restaurant for over an hour inflicting the howling on their fellow guests. The couple next to us paid and left after their starter, taking their nearly full bottle of wine upstairs, it was so unpleasant. We asked to be moved  reasonable I thought as it was early, we had booked in advance for a prime, waterfallview seat which would have been easily let out after the familyfromhell left  but no, all we were offered despite a nearempty restaurant was a table right next to a noisy Chinese group of 12. As my wife is ethnically Chinese, this looked to us like a racist putdown by the sneery maitre  'how dare you complain, look at what we have to put up with from these noisy people'  I pointed out a quiet table behind a wall, but was told that they filled the restaurant in sections over the evening, and that area was not being filled yet. The maitre's arrogance was defended up by the restaurant manager, so we paid up and went up to reception to complain. Despite some attempts at conciliation by staff especially after I emailed in a complaint from my room, picked up by the general manager, we left the hotel very disappointed. I spoke to the general manager by phone a few days later from home he had been on holiday in Italy during our visit but although apologetic he was irritatingly slippery.Indeed the whole experience put a disappointing spin on our entire stay in Switzerland  I'm a great lover of Germany and German culture, but Switzerland as a place seemed vacuous, moneygrubbing unfriendly and arrogant in comparison to visiting some of Germany's wonderful historic places. Happy to take Chinese money, but not to treat Chinese as people. How dare we complain! This is The Giessbach! I doubt I'll be back in hurry to Switzerland and as for the The Giessbach  well the location will always guarantee custom but I urge potential guests to be cautious about when they travel and to take no nonsense from arrogant, borderline racist staff. Actually looking at other reviews we are not the first to have experienced racist behaviour at this establishment."

There seems to be almost zero attempt at upkeep and maintenance even on a major health and safety matters rusted nails protruding from beach umbrellas, derelict exposed electric switchgear, broken fittings in the room and bathrooms, waffle iron broken since last December in the dining room etcStaff are openly racist. We twice had waiting staff serving us drinks walk away mid way through pouring drinks as they ran towards instead welcoming cacucasian guests. The eggs station staff served us burnt fried eggs and the very same day while serving an elderly German guest they were properly served on a tempered frying pan.The food for vegetarians was almost entirely carbohydrate based. Potato with potato was a common theme. You couldn't make it more obvious that you're trying to keep it cheap.Staff in the hotel generally treated us as if we were being done a favour. It's one thing for a place to keep things cheap but another to then allow staff to have a dismissive attitude towards its guests. Some of the bar and waiting staff were however above average. In particular the manager at the beach front bar was amazing."

'Indians' we said and lo and behold we were lied that the bar isn't open yet and we should come back after 10.30 all the while we could see people sitting right in front of us. We were than informed that we will have to also pay an entry fee of 2000 each while a discount of 2000 will be offered if you were a white skin. Later i found that even the local srilankan have to pay this color tax of 2000. Sad isn't it.

Me along with my wife entered the club on 29th Dec at around 11 pm. The guy at the gate told us that we need to pay 2000 lkr. I was just about to take my wallet out when I saw a bunch of white men stroll in. I asked if they had reservations. The guy at the gate said No Sir. Europeans are free. I was aghast that in the 21st century these things happen!! Never ever coming back to Sri Lanka again and especially this god forsaken racist place!!!!

When I told the staff that I am a foreigner too they said no you're asian that's why you have to pay! We both ended up not going there because of their sheer discrimination and for their staff being bluntly racist. For all those going to this place remember they are racist and they discriminate and judge you over your skin color! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."

My wife is from a wealthy family in Madagascar and took me to this resort thinking that I would love the experience of a pool side villa and beach. I'm an American from Texas and now living in Dubai. The service at the Restaraunt was horrible. The waiter refused to give us a table we desired, for both the dinner and then breakfast. At breakfast he didn't give us a menu. He asked ""what do you want!"" Rather rude we thought! Then we ask for a menu and he brings us just one. We finally gve up and asked for a different server. He comes back and makes up a story on how all the others are unwilling to serve us! We were shocked and walked into the managers office for help. He walks out with us starts to defend his waiter against our complaint on how rude he was. He asked are you still hungry and want to eat breakfast, to which my wife replied in French... Yes we are hungry, we have no other choice do we! The manager responds with... ""Talk to me with respect because I'm the Director here amped if you don't like our hotel then the door is wide open!!!!"" oh my god we were in shock! The racist trashy Director thinks he is more important than the customers who rent the most expensive villa and are essentially paying his salary! He sides with the rude waiter and offends his customer That's the best customer service I've seen. He clearly doesn't want our business! Can you Iamagine the type of trouble I could get this hotel into if it was in the states! We had to pay a good amount of money for horrible n offensive service and then leave.I'm searching for the owners information in France to complain about such behavior from his staff.No TV no Internet no service!

Racist management. Lack of security.,"Inout Hostel is located 16 minutes out of town, on FGC S1 or S2 line. I overheard management, talking in Catalan, making racist remarks about guests staying there. They had no idea, I understand Catalan. An ethnic waiter working here, was observed also discriminating against English speakers.  A Brazilian man touched a girl while she was sleeping in her room, making her feel afraid. Inout took 2 days to kick him out. When he returned a few days later, they checked him in for another night, and placed him in a room with girls. ZERO SECURITY for women. Smoke alarms are covered in dust and DO NOT work, especially in rooms above restaurant, and in restaurant itself. This hostel appears to attract unstable, old men. I DO NOT recommend Inout for solo female travellers, the atmosphere is creepy. On the plus side, some of the reception staff are awesome, esp the Mexican lady, but their brilliance cannot compensate for what is wrong with this hostel. The management are lazy and racist. Spend a bit more, and stay in the many good hostels in Barcelona."

In spite of prior arrangements that had been made for our group to partake of the hotel's evening buffet dinner, our group was provided only a small table away from the main buffet that was set with inferior food. We were told that we would be allowed only one serving of each item. When our tour leader complained that this was not what had been agreed to and that we were being treated like second class citizens, the hotel manager began to yell and very publicly berate our group. Needless to say, this was incredibly embarrassing for all of us. I can only surmise from the noticeable disdain written on the manager's face that Asian tour groups are not welcome in his hotel. Beyond the poor treatment received in the dining room, I should note also that the music in the hotel bar was noisy and went on well into the night. Rooms were poorly appointed. Internet was spotty at best. I would advise all travelers who do not wish to be a party to the sort of racist behavior noted above to avoid this hotel."

Things I like about it: 1. It's in a hipstreet artsydistrict Witt de Withstraat2. It's close to metro and tram 3. Ultra convenient4. No curfewNow get the bad part:1. The staff are racists2. They made Asians stay in one room3. They did not clean the bathroom starting day 4 onwards even if we requested it4. Extremely noisy from first floor because of bars around 5. They did not change sheets from day 4 onwards6. We got bedbugs after the trip 7. Hidden charges when you did not book online, rates are different on weekdays and weekends8. Laundry room is 2x6m and is shared with the house laundry like comforters and curtains9. Staff are annoyed when asked for assistance esp with washing machine. They think we cannot understand but if the machine is in Dutch10. Staff claimed to have seen 100 euro for the first time when we're ordering breakfast for 6 euro, they were just so lazy and ask us to change it somewhere else. 11. Yeah no free breakfast 12. No hang out place for traveler except the kitchen so forget about cooking 13. No group activities and tours. 14. Heater was controlled by the main desk and thermostat is impossible to adjust 15. Hazardous lighting per bed, and there's a 20 euro deposit for key which they don't disclose upon booking. I hope you try this and you would understand what I'm talking about.

When complained to hotel management, complete lack of interest even though problem has clearly been present for several weeks, so that guests could not use the public computer.  Hotel management also exhibited racist attitides, as the keyboard was French and so nonFrench guests could not be expected to use a French keyboard.  This was an inappropriate racist hotel management view, as the problem lay with a worn out computer keyboard, rather than it being a French keyboard.When the complaint was referred to the hotel General Manager, he surprisingly backed up the Duty Manager and responded in a condescending racist attitude to the nonFrench guests, as well as blatantly faiing to resolve the customer service complaints.  This is clearly a Accor group hotel to avoid at all costs, if you feel that good customer service is important factor, and quite unrepresentative of other Accor group hotels."

Because of his medical issues, he could not detect the smell. The  next day, he developed a severe headache and I checked in next day in the same room. As soon as I walked in I smelled the room. It was like mildew and mold and poop. It had a disgusting smell and later my son and daughter also arrived and smelled the same odor, because it was so late at night we tried to stay in without reporting it. The next day I found myself with a strong headache, and we went to complain, but the clerk Chad was very rude and defensive. He questioned us when this smell started to occur,  indicating that I made the smell. On 4th night we stayed, the alarm clock all the sudden turned on at 12am in the middle of night even though we never set it, I guess some people In this motel did something to it. While we were away on errands. I had to mention that cheap old junk alarm clock did sound so horrible that it almost made us have a heart attack. Also for some reason the soap dish inside the bath tub will light up at night behind the wall, it surely creeped  me out.  The manager, Steve Bovaird was also very rude when we tried to reach out to him, and he said to me, a Chinese immigrant: ""You people make your own problems"", referring to the stink in the room with his bully like manner. This was our nightmare hotel experience, I felt discriminated, and labeled in this place. Just stay away from this motel, to all my American friends.There was a lot of ugly laundry hanging at the balcony rails, very disgusting.All my Chinese and Asian friends, all immigrants, I advise you stay away from this horrible, racist place. We have much better standard and manner. A homeless shelter is better than it."

I checked into the Motel in Tallahasse Florida the day before my family arrived ahead of FSU graduation of our daughter, this went from what was suppose to be a joyous occasion to the nightmare on North Monroe Street. The room smelled like a combination of Vomit, Urine, feces, mildew, and mold. I was expecting my family to arrive that night but they were delayed until the next day. I have no sense of smell due to a medical condition and the management should have not taken advantage of me and rented room with no carpet and a bathroom with no tile and floors striped to bare exposing the wood. When the rest of the family arrived the next day they noticed the smell right away but as it was the day before graduation in a college town everything was booked so we stayed the next day in the room as well myself and my wife had terrible headaces from the rooms conditions while my brothers room dd not smell and had carpet and tile flooring.  On the morning of graduation we asked to be moved and compensated for the horrible condtions Chad at the front desk said he had to check with his manager to ""confirm"" the rooms conditions and would  move use to a different room after graduation. Chad was a very disagreeable fellow,  after we returned from graduation he did agree to move us and did not immediately agree that the room smelled only after repeated questioning in a nice mannor did Chad admit the room  had a horrible odor. Chad offered us a 50 discount on the room 131 for one night, when my wife and I insisted on additional compensation  and after much back and forth Chad agreed to comp the room rate of 175.00. On the morning we checked out my wife and I went to the lobby to get a credit for the day before as well since I have a host of medical condition and did not detect the unsanitary smell in the room since I was by myself. When we went to the front desk the clerk got the general manager Mr. Steve Bovaird. Bovaird came barreling out of the back office as soon as he heard my request for credit for the first nites stay in room 131 of 227.92.  He refused to give us any more credit My wife then stated "" you should not have rented this sick room to us""  He attacked my wife and like a gang member and did nothing but yell at us he looked at my AsianAmerican wife   Bovair pointed his finger at my wife "" You people caused your own problems"" I interceeded and told him he cannot talk to my wife like that. We were farce to face and and the next thing he said was you people need to leave so he was throwing us out. Screaming the whole time. Bovaird exhibited obvious racist intentions and La Quinta needs to separate themselves from Bovaird.  We also believe the managemnenbt set our alarm to go off at midnight to drive us crazy and get us to leave.  Do no ever stay here at this flea bag hotel. We will look into and reserve all our rights for legal action."

The easiest way to find it is to take the Kotoden train from Takamatsu Station to Kataharamachi which is just one stop away. Then, once you reach the station exit, you veer right and you then soon reach a larger street where you turn right again and then just go straight until you see the hotel in front of you. It is a large whitecoloured building with a blue sign displaying the name in Japanese only as  in front of which there is a large car park. You go left to reach the entrance above which the name is displayed in English.  Inside, the lobby is huge with a lot of seating and a series of drinks vending machines and a large reception desk. I dealt with several reception desk staff and they were all without exception totally unwilling to communicate with me at all in Japanese and refused to answer every question that I asked and refused to acknowledge  anything I said in Japanese even though they cannot speak English. They can only make oneword utterances consisting of meaningless  words such as ""this"", ""name"", ""up"" etc. Refusing to speak Japanese in Japan is just ridiculous, totally unhelpful and extremely, extremely rude. I found it extremely uncomfortable to deal with the staff at this hotel and there were no polite phrases or bowing at any time and no thank you for my custom or goodbye at the end.The room I had was on the 9th floor and overlooked the harbour so that the view was very pleasant. It was a small single room which was over 6000 yen a night on Agoda which I booked only because it was the only hotel left in town with affordable rooms during a Japanese holiday weekend. Now, I understand why it was the only one left. My preferred hotel, Takamatsu Century Hotel, was full where I usually stay. That is an excellent hotel where the staff are courteous, helpful and friendly.My room at this hotel was quite typical of any Japanese hotel with a carpet on the floor, a long desk, a TV which does have real television programmes on it and not just video on demand like at some hotels, a fridge, teamaking facilities, a telephone, torch, clothes deodoriser, hairdryer and a real wardrobe for hanging clothes. Night dress was also provided. The bed was quite comfortable with no protruding springs. However, there was boy car racing going on until late into the night when all I could hear were racing engines and screeching tyres which prevented me from sleeping much. The air con temperature in the room could not be regulated. You could only adjust the fan speed.The bathroom is also typically Japanese located in a cabinet with the usual small bath tub, wash basin and hightech toilet. Shampoo and body wash are provided as is a toothbrush with some toothpaste and plenty of toilet paper plus a couple of towels.I did not have breakfast at the hotel, but, you can have breakfast there between 06:30 and 09:30 for 1,030 yen, if you so wish. I had breakfast inside the arcade at Gasto  which can cost as little as 299 yen and they have all sorts of different breakfasts.  Check out time at the hotel is early : at 10am.Since most Japanese hotels are quite similar, good customer service is quite important. However, the customer service at this hotel is horrible, if you are a foreigner as you get treated like dirt. I felt extremely uncomfortable and intimidated by their racism. For that reason, I am giving this hotel an extremely low score and I would never even consider staying here again. It must be one of the world's rudest and most racist hotels."

The hotel is very easily walkable upto Rialto Bridge/ St. marco Square or any other part for that matter You require a GPS / Offline map to travel through this city. These areas are also well connected by water vaparitos at most hours of the date. The hotel immediate area is not having any bars or restraunt but at a walking distance of 10 mins.Venice is one of the expensive cities of Europe, and hence for the price i paid, i would have better taken some other hotel.Room:We were offered a very god room and it immediately charmed us. The walls were cladded with cloth and was very precisely concealed at joints. The room had a very royal feel and all the furniture aligned in line to maintain the theme.The room does not has any kettle or coffee maker. The hotel policy does not allow you to eat anything in the room. for people addicted to bed tea have to beg to hotel staff to get hot water and make tea of your own. Carry tea supplies as they won't give anything before breakfast starts at 8:30 AM.WIFI was disruptive and as per them they had informed the service provider to fix it.It would only work in the reception area.Bathroom and Bathing experience:The bathroom was marble finished and also had a royal theme. The Bathroom enclosure was a bit small and did not give a pleasant bathing experience. The bathroom was also less ventilated.Hotel StaffThe front desk is managed by Mr. modi During the day and Mr. Norman during the night. Mr. Modi is a polite gentleman and is very impressive with his email skills. Mr. Modi also gave a very descriptive information about the city as we arrived and was kind to keep our heavy suitcase to the room as well.Mr. Norman is on toes to help you during the night.Please read special note for the Hotel staff being racist in ""Special Comments of my review below""Breakfast:The breakfast unusually starts at 08:30 at this hotel.I did not eat in the hotel. I was not treated well and was made to feel like a bigger.Please read special note for the Hotel staff being racist in ""Special Comments of my review below""Swimming Pool  / Gym / Spa:No, Not at all. its tad small hotel.Special mention:The Breakfast lady who serves breakfast is an Englishwoman and is really a racist. We had a tour at 09:00 Am and for that we had to leave hotel at 08:15. The breakfast unusually starts at 08:30 at this hotel. We requested for a packed breakfast. After some discussion with Mr. Norman, a sandwich and boiled egg was shabbily packed in plastic bag. Later in morning, we figured out that we can spare 15 mins from 08:15 to 08:30 in the hotel and have our breakfast sitting in the restraunt.On requesting the breakfast lady which arrives at 08:05 or 08:10, she refused to use the restraunt area from which we just wanted a corner to sit and eat like humans. She told me that breakfast items are not ready. I asked that we can eat our packed stuff but in a proper way, but the next excuse she gave was that she has to wear the breakfast dress and get ready.Further, they do not allow to eat in the room, so what they expected from us was ""Take your packed breakfast and get lost and eat this on street not here"". I was really disappointed and felt being a victim of racism. For tow days of my stay i did not had breakfast at this hotel.I would urge if you can book the hotel without breakfast and instead explore much more beautiful places in city to have breakfast at.On informing the incident to Mr. Modi, he took side of the hotel. Also the hotel owner lady was present, but Mr. Modi also like a machine kept saying as per hotel policy the breakfast starts at 08:30 am only and further speaking in Italian to the Lady Owner. Again felt being a victim of racism. I being travelled to over 60 hotels in 20 countries understand what i am asking for and i also do not go overboard to make my requests.One more astonishing fact was that Mr. Modi told me bluntly to report this issue on TripAdvisor. In general the hotel listens to its guest carefully and tries to resolve. His attitude and way of speech made me feel ""go get lost and go report on trip advisor, do not bother me"". Also, when i came down on day 2 and asked him if he knew about the breakfast incidence the previous day, he acted innocent whereas he was updated by Mr. Norman and had an idea about the things. I feel somehow Mr. Modi is also not keeping to his job perfectly and is biased towards things maybe because of his pressure situation handling powerI would never stay in this hotel ever again and urge you not to be a victim of racism as well."

The biggest red flags that should steer anyone clear from this property include a racist owner who verbally assaulted us, an unprofessional operation lacking staff and basic hotel services such as access to waste bins, room cleaning, general assistance, and a laundry list of unspoken rules and expectations that are not communicated to you beforehand. When you break any of these surprise rules you will then be scolded like a child, and subjected to belligerent diatribes, locked out of community areas, and denied basic hotel requests such as the need for an additional towel, ice, etc.  In addition, there was no access to WiFi, even though its advertised as an amenity on their booking site. The antagonistic temperment of the owner, however, was completely unacceptable, and quite frankly appalling. You will notice some themes in other travelers reviews, which we experienced as well: a confrontational host exhibiting verbal aggression, pettiness, rules made up on the spot, and punishment doled out for not following these rules. Guests generally feel unwelcome and uncomfortable when confronted with her uncontrollable temper, and ultimately not surprisingly disappointed in their stay. I agree wholeheartedly with the other travelers experiences, and wished I had taken the time to do more research before booking our stay here. The uncomfortable feelings aside, by far the most upsetting part of our stay was the racism exhibited by the owner. She referred to my partner an ""uneducated European"" dozens of times during our stay because he is Turkish. For example, when we told her her we werent aware her policy of no outside food and beverages including bottled water in the privacy of your own room she condescendingly responded, Educated Europeans are aware of these things. For the record, my partner has a PhD in economics. The way she treated him in particular was very hurtful and sad, and its unacceptable in this day and age to encounter such an ignorant individual, especially one whose profession is in the hospitality industry. The property is certainly appealing based on the photographs, and is lush and green, but there are a dozen others just like it in the area run by experienced, kind people who are happy to have you as a guest. I will spare all the other grossly inappropriate details of our stay, but all in all, I certainly do not recommend this place."

So, the school had made the bookings for us there due to last minute issues with flats they have generally for DO school fellows. We also had the permission to use the kitchen in the contract since we stayed there for 8 weeks. But we had a horrible experience because of the manager named Alberto. Now in this program we were 18 fellows from different countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America. And this manager made racist comments on us at every opportunity that he could avail. For example, when we would cook in the kitchen he would come and ask us where are we from and then ridicule us by commenting that 'Is this how you clean in your countries' He would make fun of our foods, saying 'Curry, curry, curry, curry, my kitchen smells of curry, why don't you make some German food' He would shout at us for no reason and say offensive things such as 'You do not have brains to understand what I am saying' And even when we would walk in corridors he would stop us and comment ' Oh, are you from Morocco, terrorists are from there!' And when we would go to ask him for internet tickets he would make us wait or make us come back and ridicule our etiquettes even when we would be perfectly well behaved. This man made our life and experience of Berlin, Germany so bad and difficult that a lot of us stopped cooking in the kitchen even when we are all social entrepreneurs and on strict budget. Our school continuously tried to communicate strictly with him but he wouldn't budge from his behaviour. It was tough for our school to shift 18 of us somewhere else in the middle of the program in peak travel season in Berlin. It made ways for us to fell better by opening the school for longer hours and giving us the keys etc. But we have resolved to take this man down as we don't want any other person to suffer like this. And please beware he is perfectly nice to Germans but selectively troubled us from other countries.Please don't stay in this hotel if you want to enjoy a super excellent place like Berlin where all the rest of the people and experiences were super duper nice."

We only booked initially for 2 nights then a further three due to not knowing the costs of the area.  We were totally ripped off due to the colour of our skin being white.  We paid 1500 rupees per night after some haggling over the price, we than spoke with other residents who stated that they were only paying 500 rupees per night.  These were indians.  They also tried to rent us a bike for 1000 rupees per day which we found out later to be only 150 per day.  The room had A/C but was extremely basic, we found a better apartment 5 mins down the road with A/C, a swimming pool, cleaning everyday not per week with non racist management for only 500 rupees per night.  My advice is 'if you are a white tourist do not stay at Sunset cottages unless you are prepared to be taken for a ride on the racist wheel."

Rude and aggressive management and poor customer service and blatantly RACIST. They wanted all the women dressed in burkinis to use the last pool only. When we refused they got angry. Absolutely appalling attitude. The rooms given were not the ones promised. The lunch and evening meal are exactly the same. There was no fresh fruit ever. The fruit provided was on the verge of going off.

After arguing they then gave us 5 rooms that were to be changed the following day as we had booked 3 pool view rooms. Pics to follow This didn't happen either. The following day the rooms were changed but not to what we had paid for. Arguing with the staff was futile as nothing came of it. The hotel management was so poor, arrogant , rude and unhelpful staff. It's like once they have got your money and in their hell hole of hotel they don't care what your query is. We were just taken to our rooms, not told about meal times, activities, who to contact etc .MOSQUITOS The hotel is riddled with mosquitos, never have I experienced this before at this level. We had all purchased mosquito repellents but the moment we got out from our rooms to the lobby they were everywhere. FOODThe food leaves alot to be desired... same lunch  dinner is served no variety at all. Hence why we ate out every evening despite being all inclusive. You'd think you can't go wrong with breakfast but that was so basic, even skipped that as i was sick of the tasteless omlette and doughnuts everyday.Please do not be decieved by how the hotel looks from the outside.... it is beautiful but it's a shambles from inside. CLEANLINESS The pools that were ""allocated"" for modest swimwear were filthy; leaves, plastic , wood floating around, not just 1 odd day everyday. Outside my room there was a travel cot that had been dumped there for the whole week I was there and had not moved. Dishes and cutlery left in the corridor and not cleared.  see pics attached THE LIFTIf you happen to be on the 3rd or 4th floor then you are gone... 1st day I climbed 8 sets of stairs to get to the 4th floor as the lift looked very unsafe  dangerous. There was no second door to close so you can see the bare brick, wires etc as you are going up.REVIEWS ON TRIPADVISORWe had actually read some reviews and chose the hotel however if you look at the British or should I say well written reviews they are mainly negative. We met a British family who shared the same views as us and hated every moment of being there. RACISTThe most bizarre experience of my life. I was told because of wearing modest swimwear there was a separate area for us where we would feel comfortable.  that was for me to decide not them Out of the 6 pools I paid for I was able to use only 1. However on most of the days there were women in bikinis in the modest swimwear pool... this was clearly double standards... whilst I wasn't allowed in the rest of the pools she was . Told the manager who didn't do much . ANIMATION TEAM  REMIND ME WHO ARE THEY  Having been to several different hotels we were dissappointed with the animation team. When you think it can't get worse it does.. They walked around asking every single person but our group, on one of the days I asked why do you single my family out His response was because you are Egyptian  I'm not Egyptian  and people don't usually join in esp women. Clear discrimination and making assumptions...So they presumed that every single brown faced person is Egyptian and don't like taking part in activities. Most ridiculous reason. They didn't even ask any of the children or men to join in if they presumed women would be offended. Maro was walking around with a clipboard and hounding the rest to join whilst we watched. They have no sense of logic or reasoning.. so better to give upNO WIFI There is no free WiFi as advertised on the website. You have to pay extra.Overall a very bad experience: Avoid unable to upload pics as it states only 10 pics  I only uploaded 4"

He was rude to us from the very first moment he laid eyes on us until he kicked us out on the last day without the breakfast we had paid for. He called us ""you people"" so many times, I lost count. And, when we confronted him on his racism, he asked if we were going to ""assault"" him, as if black people automatically resort to violence.When we enquired about boat cruises, after seeing that the facility had 2 boats, he told us that their license had expired. We later found out from his staff that this was not the case.When we made the reservation, I called to enquire about braai facilities. I was told there were none. At no point, before our arrival, was I told that braaing was not allowed at the facility. We came with our own portable braai stand. We ensured that we braaied far away from the thatched roofs and organised fire extinguishers. The other guests also used our braai stand as they were also not aware of the situation with the braai. When we were getting ready to check out on the last day, the rude manager had confiscated our braai stand. He told us that ""you people have no respect"" said things like ""I don't want you people coming here and thinking you can do whatever you want"". He then proceeded to kick us off ""his premises"" without allowing us to have the breakfast we had already paid for.Facilities: The resort has thatched roofs and is located in the Vaal, a notoriously warm area. They did not have fans in any of the rooms. The beds did not have flat sheets in the beds so you struggled to sleep in the heat as you were forced to use the duvets and it was not. When the town ran out of ice and we purchased some from the resort, the racist manager proceeded to scream at his staff for selling ice to ""us people"". Only one pot on the stove was working. There is only one shower in the threebedroom chalet, so showering was a very long endeavour. The shower was blocked, flooded and sprayed water everywhere.Location and nonmanagerial staff: The resort is situated right by the river, with a nice view at the back. The staff was friendly and helping, with the exception of the manager. That is the only good thing I have to say about the resort.Stay away, especially of nonwhite."

We were told that we cannot sit in certain areas of the premises, for no reason, there were no nearby Braai facilities, and while there is an onsite boat that is available for hire, we were told that we cannot make use of it for no legitimate reason.

You're not allowed to bring in any food or drinks from outside the hotel as they want to be able to sell the same food/drinks at a much higher price to you. They do push you alot to buy meals from the hoteI. I bought breakfast thinking it will atleast be at a decent standard but what I got was beans on toast where you can see the toast had mould growing on the side crust. After that I didn't eat from the hotel again. I would honestly not recommend anyone buying food from the actual hotel. The hotel staff are incredibly rude and unprofessional. Many of the days when we had room servive clean up they would always forget towels. We went down to reception 3 times to ask for towels as each time they 'forgot' and recieved them about 2 hours later and one time we just got it ourselves from the room service people in the hall way. For some reason this hotel seems to have racism down as a normality among staff. The racist comments i heard against Asians, and Black people in particular were disgusting, they're too offensive to write here, but I'm still shocked, I could not believe the language that they were using. The lobby was the only place with wifi, three different days we went down at around 10 11 o'Clock pm to use the lobby wifi and the person there would turn off the router so we go back to our rooms and leave him there on his own. We'd be as quiet as possible but it was clear he just didn't want us there at all. No other hotel I've been to have ever treated customers like that. You have to pay 40 for air conditioning on top For 7days , even though nearly all of the other hotels near by have that as standard. We decided to buy the air conditioning anyway on the second day, and asked a different member of staff, who then bumped the price to 50. We were confused as they had already told us the price everyone pays so we spoke to a different person who said it was 40, then asked why this other guy said its 50. After speaking to him he said he was apparently just joking, which wasn't very funny to me...their hunger for money has blinded them from providing a decent level of customer service. Lastly I'm going to talk about physical assault. I went on this holiday with a group of friends, one of them litteraly got physically assaulted by the night manager in front of my eyes full on punches to the face and kick to his shin. Shocked is an understatement. It was a completely unprovoked attack mind you this particular night manager had previously made racist comments toward me and my friend earlier in the week. I've never witnessed such disgusting racist behaviour from any sort of hotel or even person before. If me or my friends didn't intervene the injuries to his face would've been much worse, the night manager then continued to threaten my friend. Saying that he won't be able to call the police because he 'was good friends with them' and 'they wont believe anything we say' and that 'he knows alot of people around here' and yes, these are his exact words. Being threatened in a country like Turkey was scarey and made us feel like there was nothing we can do, just take the assault and pray we make it home in one piece, this Hotel was clearly anything but safe. We had to even call the British Embassy, who sent over a rep to give us advise on what our options were. I don't wish that kind of treatment on anybody. Overall, this hotel is possibly one of the worst in Marmaris. There are alot of other hotels in the area with much better standards that cost nearly the same or just a little more with much better customer service and safety. For your own health, safety and security I would not recommend this hotel at all."

The location is great but one of the staff is racist and slightly sexist night staff in particular. On several occasions the night staff turned off the free WiFi. He was nicer to other Turkish guests and never complained when they would make noise, but whenever we spoke he would shout at us for talking too loud, bare in mind we were not speaking loudly. However there are some staff who are nice, the guy with the long hair at reception was lovely, also another young guy at the reception who doesn't speak much English. Also Vicky and her husband were lovely. I did not like the strict rule about how you were not allowed food from outside, but I do understand their reason for having this rule. I would definitely not stay at Laberna again as the way we were treated by a particular night staff member was completely unacceptable. We asked the day staff if we could arrange a meeting with the management about this but got nowhere. Also, when this same member of staff who was racist served us for breakfast he messed up our order and we were over charged. Overall, I wouldnt stay here again."

But as for the staff, more so the big guy in tattoos who looks like he just got discharged from the marines, was just the most consistently, passive aggressive intimidating guy I've ever come across. On many many occasions, especially when trying to have my measly disappointing breakfast, id have him march up to myself and my friends complaining that we dont purchase drinks from the hotel and the hotel needs to make money esp in the off peak seasons. And as far as i was concerned, that was not non of their business where i chose to eat and drink during my visit. The breakfast was really crap, limited choices. Honestly it was better to have had nothing at all. And on the day of checkout, we got accused of taking one beer out of the mini fridge. And non of us even drink. So we disputed and apparently it was the house keeping staff that had made some ""mistake"", the same ""mistake"" they made moving my mates room key around which could have meant paying 50 for a replacement. Snide little F.....s. Anyhoo. The pool wasn't so bad, if you're over 6 foot that is. I would honestly say, stay clear from this hotel, especially if you are Asian. Clear hints of racism received. Enough to ruin ones holiday... "

As for the local food choice, you need to be very cautious with the local taxi driver as they will always trick you to go for the longer route across the bridge. When we asked the hotel staff about the local good dinning area and they gave us a name and tell us to just grab a taxi and it ends up the taxi driver lied to us that its not opened and suggest us to go across the bridge for better breakfast options.

I have never been treated this bad in a five star luxury hotel in my entire life. My white Australian friend and I Asian recently stayed at the St Regis Macau for one night during our trip around Macau and China. I am a SPG Gold member. When we checked out, the front desk staff asked about our stay, I said we were happy, except we did not get upgraded to an enhanced room, which is a STANDARD benefit for Gold member. We booked a Cotai view room, and we did not even get the view from our bed. All we could see was another hotel, we had to stand by the window in order to see the Cotai view. I believed we had been downgraded. The staff apologized and told her Room Operations Manager, Aris Azhar about this. The manager then walked to my friend, greeted him by shaking his hand and handed a business card to my friend to apologize, and promised there will be an upgrade for the next stay. I was the actual Gold member and the one paying for this stay, yet the manager had zero communication with me. I put my hand out wanted to shake hand with him, but he pretended that he did not see me, walked around and went to greet my friend. I was very embarrassed and felt disrespected in front of my friend and other hotel guests, and I told the Manager that I was the one who booked this room, and he only responded with an ""Oh, sorry, hope you enjoyed your stay"". I wanted to make a complaint to the hotel GM or VP but we were in a hurry to take the next ferry. I really hate that he discriminated Asian in an Asia city, and behaved like a snob to look down on Asian. I cannot believe that it's 2018 and I, as a young professional hedge fund analyst had to faced with such disgusting RACIST behavior in my own region. I will email this RACIST issue to the Macau Tourist Board and hopefully they can stop this kind of behavior.There are thousands of Luxury hotels in Macau, just like Las Vegas, I highly recommend colored people not staying here."

Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg652134d566764r622164107HTOPCaletaPalacePlatjadAroCostaBravaProvinceofGironaCatalonia.html,Date of stay: September 2018,H.TOP Caleta Palace,Europe,Spain,Catalonia,unknown,Not a 4 star experience.,"Just arrived back from a 1 week stay here with my girlfriends family. Our first impressions of the hotel were very good. The reception area is immaculate with friendly attentive staff manning the desk. We checked in and made our way to our rooms on the second floor which was our first experience of their awful elevators. They sometimes took 510 minutes to arrive and frequently missed our floor despite us pressing the button and it illuminating. The hotel is located right on the beach and a short walk to the main town area with shops, cafes and restaurants.The rooms are extremely basic for a 4 star hotel lacking in all the basic facilities that you would normally expect. There was no kettle in the room, no fridge, no drawers, no iron, the towels were barely big enough to cover your body hand towel size and no adequate lighting for the evening. The bathrooms are very dated and ours in particular mine and my girlfriends was very dirty. The bath and sink looked like they had not been cleaned at all. The shower curtain looked as though it had not been changed between guests too. Nonetheless we did not let this ruin our holiday as we did not spend much time in the room.The bar is open from 9am until 1am but as an all inclusive guest you are only able to order between 10:30am and midnight. This includes ordering basics such as tea and coffee which as stated is awkward since there are no tea making facilities in the room. Something that is not clearly advertised is the different levels of all inclusive. By default you are booked as a premium guest but you are extremely limited to what you could order for free. You are given the opportunity to upgrade to gold all inclusive for 25 euros per person per day. On a positive note the bar staff were very friendly and made everyone feel welcome. We had some issues with the language barrier at times but they try their best to understand.You are given 2 cards per person on arrival at the hotel. One card is for orders at the bar and for access to the restaurant and the second card is for the glasses for your drinks. This means you have to queue to get your drink then queue again to return your glass to receive your card back. This kept the bar constantly busy due to the amount of queueing that you have to do. We gave up with the glass card by day number two and just accepted thin plastic cups instead. Their drinks menu is very confusing as it only shows what each drink costs for non all inclusive guests and a discounted price for the different levels of all inclusive. It would have helped greatly to see what all inclusive guests can actually order. They had a different cocktail on offer everyday which was free for all inclusive which we enjoyed.On to the restaurant which is very large with adequate seating for all guests. We only found seating an issue when a very large French party arrived and reserved a quarter of the restaurant every night but only reserve the large tables. We were in a party of nine therefore also required a large table therefore were sometimes either split up or had to squeeze onto a table for six. The food was fantastic every day with a wide range of choice but we found it was not clearly labeled therefore was actually unsure what we were eating sometimes. This did not pose a problem to us since none of us have allergies or restrictions but found it important to mention for awareness. Baked beans were regularly stone cold but there are microwaves available. We found it strange that you are unable to use the drinks machines during lunch and evening meal times, you could only queue and order at the small bar in the restaurant which was always packed so ended up going without drinks most of the time. The restaurant staff were attentive and helpful and always greeted us with a friendly 'Hola'.Evening inhouse entertainment was very basic and repetitive consisting of kids disco for 1 hour from 9pm then either live singing or just music played loudly. On our second night we were excited to find a movie theme quiz was scheduled so we put our names down for it. This was almost cancelled due to many complaints from a select few from the large French group. When put to a vote which should NOT have happened it went ahead. It was rushed and was ruined by the few French guests shouting comments out throughout the quiz and putting their fingers in their ears like you would see from a child. Live music was planned after the quiz however one of the rude French guests insisted his phone was plugged in and French music played for the rest of the evening rather than the international playlist as played on all other nights. To our disgust the entertainer allowed for the French guest to plug in his phone and therefore the nonFrench guests left.Although the majority of the French party were friendly, we still encountered incidents throughout the week that ruined our experience. Any time any children two of which were in our group were playing, they would shout at them and tell them to shush which is completely unacceptable in a hotel that advertises themselves as a family hotel. The children were regularly bored as there was nothing for them to do either in the hotel or in the resort. During a busy period in the restaurant a member of our party and a French man accidentally bumped into each other whilst reaching for food. My brother in law apologised and the other man accepted and then asked my brother in law ""are you English"" he responded ""yes"" to which the French man replied by rolling his eyes and saying ""ugh"" and then walked away. If we were sensitive we could have said that was a racist comment.The two outdoor pools that are advertised are both small, particularly the child's pool which could only be approximately the size of a king sized bed. The main pool is a lot smaller than you would expect for a hotel of this size. No floats or inflatables are allowed in the pool which again limits activities. There is nowhere to get changed near the pool but you are unable to walk through the hotel in wet clothes.I have noticed comments aimed at the large Welsh family in other reviews. Other than them being rude to the lifeguard once we did not find them that much of an issue. People need to remember they were on holiday too.Overall the hotel does have it's issues. It is dated and is in need of a makeover which I believe is currently in progress. We managed to enjoy our holiday but we will not be returning to the hotel and would not recommend to families or the under 50s."
Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg652134d566764r144405138HTOPCaletaPalacePlatjadAroCostaBravaProvinceofGironaCatalonia.html,Date of stay: October 2012,H.TOP Caleta Palace,Europe,Spain,Catalonia,unknown,Wouldn't recommend,"I don't usually write reviews, I read them and think people are being overly picky but I thought I should as there as so many reviews that are complete contrast so I would have my say. This is coming from someone who has slumped it in Prague to top notch in Turkey so I think I will be honest and fair. Firstly the location, Brilliant..... The beach although is more stoney is very nice, in a little cove hiding away around the corner is miles of clean beach, very relaxed and a place you can really relax so full marks there. The hotel, firstly you have to pay 4 euros a day for parking which is abit harsh considering your staying there but I can live with that. The check in was ok no issues really, if you want a safety deposit box it's 35 euros which you get 10 back although we were told on 3 occasions that it would all be refunded to when it came to check out I found out this wasn't true but at 6am and heading for a flight you can't stand and argue. We went up to the room and the first thing we saw was the bathroom which was a good size and was surprisingly good. That's where it ended. The room is as basic as it came with a couple of beds a table and chair which were pointless, the smallest tv possible on a rusty metal shelf unit. The room seemed grubby with racist writing on the wall. I had read on here that some people weren't happy with the room they were changed no problem. They were lucky as I asked 3 times for a different room and was fobbed off every time being told to come back later. To the point we got fed up asking and gave up. The drinks are served in small plastic glasses, that we got over but when some of the bar staff didn't fill the glasses up left a sour taste in the mouth as we wanted to relax not get up every 2 minutes after our shot of lager. We got over that Aswell. The food......... The breakfast was always the same which was fine as you can't really change it there was a good choice. Main meals for lunch and dinner were quite varied although no wonder there weren't any pigs about because pork was on every day and night without fail. The problem with the food was I can count on one had the amount of hot or even warm food I ate. I don't think the hot plates worked as the food was usually cold. Deserts were the same every meal without fail but I was ok with that as I don't eat deserts and my son was happy with ice cream. As for the staff, I was surprised more staff didn't speak more English due to the amount of English guests but that wasn't the problem. The problem was that there were a few rude staff, one waiter stood there shouting at me in Spainish because I assume we sat on a table he had just reset but then there weren't any others so what did he expect us to do sit on the floor Good job I didn't understand him as he may just have got a mouthful back. The main people who managed the door to the restaurant were very good, friendly and remembered how many we're in each group. The entertainment wasn't back and full marks to the dancing guy who did his best to get all the kids up dancing, he was a trier. The snacks are available at certain times and usually deep fried something. We didn't eat it so can't comment on the taste. The hotel also states that at 11pm they ask for respect and quiet but that didn't happen and on too many occasions when my son was trying to sleep kids were screaming in the hall and on occasions a group of French guests stood virtually outside our door having a meeting for about an hour before I opened the door and my face made it clear I wasn't impressed. Downstairs there were times when there weren't enough seats for the entertainment. There are also a few games to play at a euro each but there were a lot of occasions where the machines took someone's money without anything back and then the machines out of order. To sum it wasn't a great stay. Maybe it was a bad week but I always give an honest opinion and I think this is an accurate review. Anything else I can answer feel free to ask. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone who asks though."

The rooms were always cleaned every day with fresh towels, food was good and something for everyone, bar was good and we were not restricted on drinks at all. All the staff were very friendly. We were worried as people had said things about racisms towards the english tourists but this is rubbish, everyone was treated the same. The only difference is the staff speak more to the spanish guests im guessing because its easier to comminicate when its their language. For a cheap all inclusive u dont expect 5 star luxury if u want that go elsewhere, but if u want a friendly value for money family orientated hotel, close to the beach with a good bar caleta palace is the place to be. I have no complaints, the location and the views are spectacular!!"

Got to our room and found that it smelt of dog. Dogs are actually allowed to stay here!!! Room was straight out of the sixties and twin beds had waterproof sheets on that crinkled everytime you moved. Breakfast next morning was plentiful and awful, unless you are a fan of cold fried food, Lunches and evening meals were again plentiful and again awful, You could have as much as you wanted, just dont step on the roaches.No entertainment at night only the bar or go out. Apart from Benji at reception, whos mum is from Oldham,the rest of the male staff are rude,ignorant and possibly racist. I say this because they were fine with other spaniards or germans or french.Service at the bar is in 1/2 pint glasses only half full. Staff are not in the least bit friendly or helpfull, and for the record, my wife is a fluent spanish speaker and I can understand lots of the language so we did try, The day before we left,we asked reception to check our pick up for the airport and we were told to go out and use a coin phone in the street. The shame is that the location,the beach and the town are really nice. If you can get all in for about 20 give it a go and eat out. I have to say Ive never been so glad to leave somewhere."

Beleive what uread  the staff here are are racist.. i was autually told i wouldnt be served first because of the colour of my skin white. They will leave u stood at bar for ten /15mins plus and serve spanish or germans or whatever rather than serve the english.  One of the bar staff screamed in my face because she was stressed out and walked off in the middle of serving me. only a poor effort on entertainment.  eleven   is last orders , dont believ hotel brochures that tell u 12,u are  then ruddley told by a ""security guard"" whilst shining a torch in your face to leave the terrace  or they will fetch the police..most abruptly. I never saw a hairdressers here , the tv consisted of eurosport and cnn as only english speaking chammels and that packed up after a few days. Food is same enough more or less all the time and beware if you have allergies as nothing is labeled as to what it is. forget getting a sun lounger unless u a towel dropper as they all gone early with empty towels strewn across them. basically the area is beautiful the staff ruined it from  being a relaxable enjoyable expierence and the fact the entertainement was crap , and a lot of othere people were disapoointed to..never again ..listen to this its true!"

This place is the worst i've ever had the misfortune to have paid good money to be insulted. firstly, we arrived late to this hell and therefore it was morning when we realised that it was a haven for OAP's with zimmer frames at breakfast. I'm not quite that old yet and felt a little out of place. On the notice board bingo in spanish was the ""entertainment"" along with ballroom dancing! Nearly cried! On arrival, we were given a rules and regulation handout. On this information such as meal times and the times of the  bar was printed. We opted for the all inc before going and noticed that the bar closed at 12 midnight and thought the time was good. However, one particular barman made it very obvious that he did not like the Brits and was very rude to a number of people. He asked me if I wore a watch sneeringly and sarcastically when I asked for a Cola at 11:05. They changed the rules and closed the bar at 11pm  When I pointed out that the bar openings were printed, They pretended that they did not understand English although understood how to speak with sarcasm! I am not a lager lout and drink little or no alcohol but the bar really was the only entertainment!. I tried to ask for things in Spanish at all times.  Meal times were worse! After selecting food from a limited and tastless buffet, you would be ushered out of your seat and herded along with other brits with wrist bands to alternative seats. This happened every night and you were never sure where to sit as the head waiter kept changing his mind and barked in spanish. He just kept ""moving the goalpost."" As other poster has said, no reps or outside contacts, nothing to do,awful beach, awful hotel. I could go on but I think you get the gist. It was the second most miserable week of my life. The other being stuck in hospital with an infection. Go at your peril !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Things stolen and rude staff,"We second the review below that says if it wasnt for the Mediterranean Sea being on the doorstep, this place would be out of business Upon first arrival, it seemed like a nice place to stay, thats where the word nice stops in this review. We were shown to our room/cabin, which is when we quickly realised was more of a shoebox, which can only just fit two people comfortably... it was not pleasant at all! Basic hygiene was nonexistent and it seems as though the place hasnt been cleaned for a while. The beach is what you expect. But be warned, it costs upwards of 11 euros to even sit on one of the beach chairs, with absolutely NO sign telling you of this  only a man who comes around taking payment. This came as a shock to not only us but at least 3 other groups around us  we all vacated immediately.The bar area was completely cringeworthy, where despite people attempting to have a good time, on more than one occasion we could hear staff making crude and creepy comments to young girls. It was also incredibly overpriced  be prepared to shell out a lot of money for less than mediocre.What takes the cake however, were the staff, particularly in reception and in the eating/restaurant areas. Rude and lazy seem to come to mind. One of my possessions which holds a lot of sentiment went missing when we ate, and despite us asking staff for help finding it, none of them could be bothered one even said while laughing that one of the many Chinese tourists must have taken it. Lets add the word Racist to the description of this place... If they were even slightly helpful, it wouldnt have been the biggest deal, however there was no courtesy at all. IF YOUVE MANGED TO READ THIS FAR DOWN, I HOPE YOU DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND NOT BOOK THIS PLACE. Were definitely not your usual complainers and this is the first time Ive written a review about a place, its such a shame it had to be a negative one."

In fact, I dont think Ive ever been treated more rudely by any member of the service industry anywhere in the worldand I am an experienced traveler who has stayed at hundreds of hostels/hotels/campsites/etc. all over the globe.Commence rant:  I showed up tired after a long day of traveling you know the typenothing works the way its supposed to, and now that youve finally arrived youre just ready to lie out on the beach and relax. I had booked a fairly nice private room, having mostly outgrown the dorm scene. Checkin was going okI had handed over my passport presumably so it could be photocopied, as has been the case at other hostels that have wanted a look at my passport, and I was getting the little speech about where the bar/beach/rooms were. Just as we were about to walk over to my actual room, I realized I hadnt gotten my passport back, so I politely asked for it before I left. This is when everything took an abrupt turn for the worse. The main receptionist who had, for lack of a better way to describe it, a fairly derivative hipster mustache that would have been cool in Brooklyn in about 2008 laughed at me condescendingly and told me that the hotel policy was to confiscate all passports and that I would get mine back when I checked out. This surprised me, as Ive never encountered such a policy before; I told the guy that I wasnt really comfortable handing over my passport like that I think its pretty obvious why, and in response, he laughed condescendingly once more and embarked on an attempt to show off to a couple of fellow female guests who had just walked in the door.This attempt involved a number of tactics. One was to spew indiscriminate insults in my direction. Another was to laugh at me some more and call me a hysterical woman who didnt know how to calm down I really dont think I was being particularly hysterical either. Another was to rant about the fact that I was an American and thus, presumably, entitled and whiny. Still another was to take the antiAmerican posturing to the next level by being pretty shockingly racist direct quote: We dont have beards here; we arent Muslims. You dont have to be afraid of us.. And so on and so forth. I wound up just paying for the hotel room and then booking another room at a Starwood property. Once I got there, I burst into tears from a combination of exasperation at my treatment at the original hostel and relief that the receptionists at the new hotel were treating me like a human being. Reading back over this, I dont think Ive really been able to convey just how bullied and ridiculed I felt. I also dont think that as a solo female traveler its unreasonable to want to have control over my passports whereabouts. At some point in the exchange, it emerged that they would have accepted my drivers license as well that wouldnt have worked for me in any case as Id rented a car, but at the end of the day, the passport wasnt in itself the crux of the issuemy treatment was and for the record, the place where I rebooked did not attempt to confiscate my passport. So lookmaybe you'll have an ok time here some people seem to have enjoyed it, but I think it's a bit of a crapshoot. Fortunately, I'm 30 now, done with law school, and have a pretty comfortable budget, so paying double for a night was not the end of the world for me, but I've been on a shoestring budget before and know what it's like to be 22 and flat broke. If it were me, I just wouldn't risk staying here; Mykonos has plenty of beach party places to visit its not like this island is off the radar. Find another one!"

My parents who are Caucasian rented a room for a week to celebrate my Mom's retirement from the United States Postal Service after 20 years of service.  When booking the room they mentioned why they were going to be staying down at the beach and that some family and friends would be visiting during their stay. The representative over the phone told them that would be fine and that they even had some picnic tables they could use down by the pool.  They checked in on Wednesday, July 20th and had some friends come to visit throughout the first couple days with no problem.  Keep in mind that their friends that came to visit the first couple days were all Caucasian.  They were able to use their pool and spent time in the room socializing with them.  Saturday, July 23rd was when I, my fianc, and our children finally made it down to spend the day with them.  My father, who is a pilot, flew my Mom down to the Keys for breakfast and I was left a key at the front desk so I could set up some cupcakes, food and decorations for when they came back.  When picking up the key from the front desk I had no problem, the front desk attendant didnt even ask for my ID remember I am also Caucasian.  I got back in the truck where my fianc and children were waiting so we could unload the food and decorations.  As soon as we got up to the room, this was within 510 minutes.  I noticed that the phone was ringing. I didnt answer it because I thought it was someone for my parents and that they could reach them on their cell phone.   It continued to ring and by this time my sister n law had arrived to help me prepare some food.  The phone kept ringing so she answered it and said a man identified himself as the manager and asked for my Mom. She said she will be back shortly but can I help you with something  He then said that there are too many people going back and forth to the room and wanted to make it clear that any visitors are not allowed to use any of their facilities and need to leave the premises by 8 pm.  I contacted my parents to let them know of the phone call.  When they arrived back on the property my Mom was crying because she wanted to enjoy the day in the pool and on the beach with her Grandchildren. Her and my Dad went down to the office and were told things like we dont want people coming here from Miami to party and we dont allow frats to have parties here and that they have rules in place to avoid these things. My parents informed them that there were no rules broken and they were very confused as to why their family was not allowed to visit them. We are NOT from Miami and we are NOT a frat They then said that if they cant use the pool we can just take our stuff down to the beach and they were told they couldnt do that either and that the beach was private and they would call the cops on them!!!  This whole conversation was recorded and is still available.  After hearing the recording with all ignorant remarks about being from Miami and frat parties I became upset and realized that all of this happened as soon as my fianc and children, who are Hispanic, stepped out of the vehicle.  They thought that we were Spanish people from Miami and were coming to have a big loud party when in actuality just wanted to enjoy time with family and friends. I then went down to inform the front desk that they made my mother cry on a day that was supposed to be a once in a lifetime celebration and that she cant even go swimming in their facilities with her Grandchildren.  I voiced to her that as soon as the managerwho never showed his face saw my fianc get out of his truck they stereotyped him due to the way he looked. The front desk attendant then said that we DO stereotype so she admitted it. I told her for future reference if they dont allow visitors they should inform them of that when booking the room instead of making it seem like it is ok and even offering the picnic tables over the phone. She said she will note it for the future and then I left. Basically, my point is that if you have darker skin you will probably not be allowed at this resort and will definitely not be able to use their facilities.  This was a horrible experience and the Better Business Bureau will be contacted for this act of discrimination."

I have stayed there several years in a row. This year the management must have changed because they were extremely rude. My family rented several rooms and they kept coming to say we had too many people in one room when we got together. At check out the guy helping me was super rude and a little racist. My family and I will not be returning next year. We'd rather stay anywhere but there and be treated the way we were treated.

Every year the facility has had something new or updated. We come here because it's a great place to stay. It's very clean, beautiful, and most of all, safe. Ken and the staff are very professional and courteous to everyone.  We recently stayed in our favorite apartment 34, which is located on the third floor. The same days that coincided with the group that are leaving such ridiculous reviews. We were awakened by this group on their first night here around 1:30AM as they stood outside of our apartment door. They we extremely loud, with absolutely no regards to any other guests at the resort. Within a couple of minutes, I heard Ken the manager telling them to quite down. They were arguing with him saying he couldn't keep them from talking. He insisted that they return to their apartments and told them they were breaking the noise curfew. He told them that if they didn't want to follow the rules, they could leave. They finally started leaving as Ken continued to take their verbal abuse.We also were at the pool the afternoon when most of the women and teenagers from the group had their food and drinks in and around the water. As Ken was walking by, he looked over at the pool and saw them with their food and drinks. He walked up to the pool fence and asked them to get their food and drinks out of the pool. He told them they could only have it at the tables. Someone made a smart remark. Ken pointed to the Pool Rules sign that says that food and drinks aren't allowed in the pool. He then turned and walked away.I just can't believe how they are twisting everything around. Ken is definitely not a racist. Over 60 of his staff are Hispanic. Most of them have been there as long as Ken. It's pretty obvious that the group is doing everything the can to take make Ken into the bad guy. This is a great place to stay because of Ken enforcing the rules. Go Ken."

The condo was spotless and very roomy.  We left the sliding glass door open to enjoy the sound of the gulf.  Relaxed on the porch to a beautiful beach view.  The property is right on the beach with sugar white sand  cleaned every morning.  The staff was very friendly, helpful, and responsive.  We asked for a better corkscrew and one was delivered in minutes.  A mixer didn't work and a new one was delivered while we were out.  We were offered beach towels on loan and lots of local information.  I was pleasantly surprised to find our room had wireless internet, which worked beautifully.  They kitchen was fairly well stocked with dishes, pots, pans, cutlery.  They also had a DVD/VHS player available on loan as well.  Had to go to the laundry room for ironing board access due to the manager's having prior guests burn holes in the bedspreads.  They are planning additional services to upgrade the star rating  more parking and a restaurant.  I just hope it doesn't increase the price too much or make too popular  we want to return!  The rooms are private and quiet  racial/ethnic diversity was welcomed.  We saw families and couples  most had stayed multiple times.Some info:  We were there over spring break.  The property is on the quiet end of the beach but traffic over the causeway bridge can be awful, especially morning and evening.  Best to go the long way around on Bonita Beach Road and save the time and frustration.Suggestions for improvement:  Iron and ironing boards in the rooms, a decent corkscrew, curtains in the bedroom for more privacy they have vertical blinds, but curtains would be a nice addition."

My husband and I went to Durhamtown and needed a place to stay that accepted medium size dogs for the weekend. I made reservations a week before and called to get information about their pet policy. After 8 hours drive in heavy rain, we finally got to the hotel at 4am to discover their pet policy was not what they said it was on the phone or online and they were going to charge us more. First the hotel is really what you get for the price. The place smells, lights dont work, bathroom and bed dont seemed to be cleaned very often. The mini refrigerator had food from the last guest and microwave was dirty inside. That said we didn't expect much so we just endured it and I wouldnt come here to give a bad review just for these reasons.At check out, however, I decided to complain about the extra charge. I have never experienced discrimination against my nationality until this old lady named Pat that worked in the front desk of Jameson Inn Washington asked me ""Are you a travel agent"" ""Where are you from anyway"" followed by a pause making a superior face ""You are not American."" and after that accusation ""You should watch out!""First Im not an agent, but what did she care if Im an agent or not Whats up with this interrogation Second I have all the right in the world to complain about an unexpected extra charge of any kind, and me being an american or not should have no bearing on the situation. I thought hotels were aware that foreigners stay in them while traveling. Apparently not at this cy hotel. Third what the hell should I watch out for Am I supposed to be an illegal alien, in fear of her calling immigration She should be the one watching out for her job because I truly hope she has been fired by now.Pat is an old lady who needs to realize that the racist attitudes of the old deep south have no place in 21st century US and is quite lucky that her racist tirade didn't earn her employer the discrimination lawsuit her actions richly deserved."

VERY RACIST!,"We visit Cabo from Oregon often and usually enjoy it. At least 7 times a year. We are a diverse family. I have very light skin, my husband is African/Mexican and has very dark skin. Unfortunately we run into this situation where resorts in Cabo dont want Mexicans in them. It is getting better but it still happens on occasion. Ten years ago, it was much worse. Today my mother and children took a taxi from Pueblo Bonita Sunset to Cascadas to eat lunch and were welcomed to enter the resort from the street side. We walked all the way though the resort without a problem. We looked like the typical gringo tourists. My husband was already at the beach and met us from the beach access side near the restaurant. We ate and did some pottery painting. It was a nice day. My husband accompanied us today o take a taxi back to our resort. As we were leaving all together to go back to our resort, a security guard followed us and told us that we could not leave through the way we entered, he wanted us to walk around the side of the resort because my husband is Mexican and this was private property. We eat at Cascadas about 20 times a year. I walk though the resort every time. Then when my husband accompanies me, the resort security harasses us. This is enough. I needed to tell the public what happens here if you have dark skin at this resort. The restaurant has never treated us bad but the security are racist and I am not going to let my daughter witness this type of discrimination. This is a photo of the supervisor who I tried to talk to about the discrimination. He was even more racist than the security."

The rooms are decent but their service and attitude downright crappy and here are some details:1. Everyone from the reception staff to those at their restaurant/coffee shop are cold and barely smile.  Probably if we had visited them in summer, they would have been cordial.2. Their elevators suck and are an antithesis to German engineering.  So, if you are taking the elevator with a bag or two, factor 20 minutes travel time.  No kidding, I am serious.  They seem to have their own mind, close too quickly,  never arrive.3. Their breakfast spread is poor and their attitude towards nongermans bordering on being racist.  We were told that the breakfast is served at a restaurant next to their hotel within the same compound and not at the coffeshop inside the hotel for those part of group bookings.  We walk about 50 steps out in cold weather and then could not enter because the had lost their door keys, so we had to hang around in the cold for a good 10 mins and then ushered in via their kitchen.  Right throughout the breakfast service I never saw any of their staff make an appearance or even offer a courtesy smile. 4. Their wifi does not work anywhere but only in the reception and yes they will not tell you about it as they expect you to try from your room and then figure this secret yourself."

I'm one to read reviews over and over before booking a place and getting myself into a right stress. The hotel itself is nice, clean, good location to beach and bars and has very friendly staff that work long hours. Food was OK but nothing to write about it does need to be improved. I had read about the pick pocketers before leaving and unfortunately we did have an experience with this luckily I already clocked what the man was trying to do and bent his finger til he let go and ran off. So do be aware of this as it was right outside of the hotel. It's not that bad, few tweaks needed but can't really complain for the price we paid but I wouldn't pay anymore. There is a good mix of Spanish Russian and English at this hotel so don't be put off by the racist ""rude Russian"" statement's you can't tie everyone with the same string it's 2015 for gods sake. I will say though we did book a pool view and didn't get one. Balcony was huge and made up for this.But thank you med playa for not being as bad as first expected!"

Depending on what chef was cooking, it was raw. The entertainment was shocking , i have never felt so left out or ignored in all my life. they had a kids disco that lasted 10 mins, 3 songs and 2 of them were spanish songs. They had live music which consited of a spanish girl playing a keyboard and all the spanish were up ball room dancing. My dad took my daughter up to dance and they all started looking down at them and stairing at them, my dad and another man was actualy asked to leave the dance floor or dance ballroom, which didnt go down well with any of the english speaking people. The thomas cook rep Luke was useless we complained on the 2nd day he said he would sort it but nothing happened we told him again and he told us that he didnt think were serious about complaining, seriously get a grip. The rooms were tiny, there were 4 of us to a room and they had 4 single beds all lined up in a row along one side of the room , therefore we had to get on and off the bed from the bottom.

Charged room fee  deposit together and wont refund! Stay away! ,"I stayed one night at this hotel on August 24. The hotel itself is a bit off central Boston; however, nothing a short Uber ride won't fix. The property itself deserves its 4 start ranking. The room is spacious and has all the amenities; albeit I was surprised to see no complementary water and a simple 500ml bottle costing 3. Anyhow, the bathroom is very small, it is also dated and showing scruff marks; the bath itself was stained with dripping shampoo and conditioner from the containers on the wall. Not a very welcoming sight. My biggest complaint with this hotel is the customer service. The lady at reception checking me in was quite rude and racist, speaking and chatting with other customers while checking me in and ignoring me!  ADDITIONALLY, while my room  taxes  fee was 188, she charged 263.85 to my credit card and told me 75 was refundable deposit; it is a hold and will be released after 1 week or so. Now has been 2 weeks since my check out and no refund, no release. I find it PERPLEXING that she combined the room charge and supposedly deposit HOLD into one charge, how can she release part of the charge laterI have sent them 3 emails by now, detailing my case, and have yet to receive an answer. So, if you want to have security and good customer service and do not want to be overcharged almost 100 with NO REPLY or explanation, please seek other plentiful options of nice 4 star hotels in Boston.SCAM alert! I repeatedly asked them to provide evidence that they released the deposit, they said they cannot. I have stayed in worldwide hotels and all other hotels could give me a credit slip saying the deposit has beened debitted back, but this one special hotel cant. Dishonest! "

For the entire 2min conversation, despite me asking her multiple questions, she didn't even look at me a single sec.My room was not cleaned after a night of stay and a long day at the conference a sufficient reason for a 2 star. I went to talk to her after the conference in the late afternoon. She asked me 4 questions, ranging from ""did you put a do not disturb"" sign outside the door to ""did you check in just this morning"", instead of apologizing for the oversight. Basically she was trying to come up with all possible excuses not to arrange someone to clean my room, and blame me for their fault. Even worse, after a long discussion, she finally said she would arrange someone to come clean my room, which didn't happen after a 2hour dinner! Only did I call again after she left, her friendly colleague Mina apologized and literally found someone to clean my room in a minute.I wish Royal Sonesta stops hiring racist staff, and give them enough training to have the same attitude to all customs of all color."

After ordering drinks at the lobby bar we saw that, the same door man was letting in other guests, who were wearing round neck T shirts. After half an hour we tried entering the lounge once again, and the door man stopped my friend once again, and said I cannot let you enter wearing  a 2 dollar T shirt.      When I asked him why is there a discrimination with round neck T shirts, he told me, for no apparent reason that    you are Arabic and Im also Arabic now go.. when I told him that we were not Arabs  but Indians, he very rudely said  yeah Im also an Indian now just go away.

We arrive at the hotel ready to check to be greeted by Hamza, we were told we had to pay for the booking so we advised the booking has already been paid for and showed him the proof, he said this was a holding fee and we needed to pay again to get the holding funds refunded back to us, we agreed to do it, we tried with both a Visa card and a MasterCard and both were declined so he said we needed to pay cash, something about that didnt sound right to us, we asked to speak to the manager and he advised he would be in tomorrow after 11am. Hamza was very rude to us and refused to let us stay at the hotel, aswe were leaving Hamza followed us outside and started to hurl abuse at us calling myself a btch as well as other names towards my partner, he also said because he has our card details he would charge lots of stuff to it so basically being fraudulent. We left and found somewhere else to stay for the night. We went back to the hotel the next day Monday 8th October to speak with the manger, we were told that the manager spoke very little english so he would translate. Prior to us booking we had tried to cancel via email more than 48 hours previous which is stated in there policy, he said this needed to be done via the website we booked through, we booked directly through them and there was no option to cancel it.

Avoid and stayaway, very racist towards people of colour. Not a safe place and not worth the price.","The only good thing about this hotel is that its close to town centre. The rest is a delusion and fake printed picture of how BrownLows Inn Hotel actually treat their guest. Be cautions if you are a person of colour Booking at this Hotel and looking for a relax and peaceful day off. Yes, there are still illiterate people out there who still thinks it's fine to behave racist towards people of colour.It was all friendly and smiling until I realised what I have gotten myself into. Ended up in a basement without window and no facilities. When I complained regarding this matter and others, I was asked how much I paid for the room and where did I book it. The staff seem to appear understanding, but in reality, they are mocking you. I was told by a lady working at the bar that if I didn't like the room, I could leave the same day or tomorrow as it was fine with them. And when I check out the next day, this same lady told me to get my refund I had to call booking.com and let them know that I have checked out. She even told me everything was fine on their side and she had already checked me out. But to my surprise, since I informed booking about my check out, the Hotel has not responded to any calls or emails from booking. I even went back to this same lady and alerted her that booking had attempted several time reaching out to the hotel and her respond' they don't have to call, they should just email us, and the mysterious manager will reply. However, till this date, they have refused to respond to any emails sent to them regarding this matter and refuse to refund me back the remaining stay. The lady I talked to at the bar had a redlooking hair colour at the time of the conversation, and I was directed to her most of the time to address my complaint. I assume she's the manager, although every time I had a conversation with her, she always mentions this mysterious manager whom I did not meet. Its a shame what I experienced at this hotel and no one regardless deserve this.Their staff appears to be friendly, but extremely racist towards people of colour.  It's a basement or whatever it is that have been renovated to look like a modern standard, but do not be duped by the shine, cause its cover in dirt. Some of their room does not have windows, inadequate facilities, and no wifi access in the rooms. The bathroom had hair in the shower, the towel was very filthy, and the toilet was not clean, and they left the remaining of used toilet tissue. Although, it's doubtful whether some of the places do have these facilities, but yet, some customer will be deprived of this due to the colour of their skin.  On the first night, I was harassed by one of their staff, a young guy by the name of Jane, along with an older guy who was sitting at the bar. The older guy sitting at the bar was watching TV. I was on the cell phone and did not want to disrupt him; hence I decided to sit on the other side of the bar. He knew I was in the bar but did not say anything until Jane came out and this older guy told Jane that, 'there is a black person in the hotel sitting at the bar'. Jane then went on by making this into laughter stating Is there a black person sitting at the bar. He repeated this three times. The older guy at one point left his chair and started walking towards me starring right in my face, and at that point, I felt threaten and unsafe, as I was the only black person sitting across the bar.I asked if everything was ok or if there was a problem. Jane then walked to the other side of the bar towards me and asked why I was sitting at the bar and if I was staying at the hotel. It was extremely scared and for the firsttime fear for my life to even spent the night at that hotel. I couldnt sleep that night and had to secure my door, and it was a nightmare. Since I left their Hotel and forward the matter to booking, they refuse to answer any call from Booking and refund me back. Avoid and Stay away from this Hotel, not safe and not worth the price. No one regardless their skin colour, religious, gender, ethnicity, or whatever, should go through such horrific experience I had at the Brownlow Inn Hotel. Its a shame a disgrace and such behaviour is unacceptable. Be aware the kind of Hotel you book and be aware of the review as well and who is writing it. This Hotel is a bar/hotel which could also be a contributing factors to some of the beautiful review."

First of all it wasn't the hotel that we paid for through the travel agency. When we arrived to the airport we were informed that the hotel was about 40kilometers from the hotel. That was not the truth. They failed to mention that they would be dropping off everyone else at their hotels which ended up almost being a 2 hour bus ride. The worst part of our stay was the fact that the majority of the occupants there were Russian. It mainly wasn't the fact that they were Russian but  the fact that we are a biracial couple, made us the center of attraction wherever we went. Everything from sitting down eating, laying on the beach or simply sitting by the pool was VERY uncomfortable. The staff were not helpful in anything. The food was the same thing except for the last night there. The whole hotel is centered on Russians so please don't stay at this hotel if you want to expect an equal opportunity to enjoy turkey. "

First of all I hate writing bad reviews; some people find things to complain about however I am warning people not to stay here.Firstly on a better note; the hotel was immaculately clean and in good working order. The rooms were basic but that's all we needed.    The hotel was a fab location right in the hub of Lloret so everything was five mins walking distant.Sadly,95 of the staff were HORRENDOUS! On arrival all seemed fine but as all inclusive guests we were treated terribly. The staff would: ignore us when at the bar waiting to be served by walking away or starting a conversation with another staff member. One waiter 'Fernando'  we believe he is called very very tall man is a racist towards English people. Would refuse to serve on occassions aswell as serve the wrong drink and verbally attack if questioned. Or he would prepare the drink and either throw it at you or walk off and shut the door. Another barman told us we eat too much, refused to provide us with food because we're greedy only asked for a plate of crisps and they would all talk about you in Spanish. They would shout at you if you laughed around the pool area and were basically sexist and racist!! I saw a few reviews and thought nah can't be that bad but it was. If it was any longer than 4 days I would of found other accommodation As part of all inclusive we were allowed drinks 11am to 11pm with brekkie lunch and tea and snacks in between. Food was basic  and the same thing every single day. Fab place but terrible hotel "

It is not a 5star hotel at all at best it's a 3 star, I stayed here for 3 nights with a group of friends and by far the worst 3 night holiday ever.The disappointment began on arrival, the outside of the hotel was very run down not what any of us expected of a fivestar hotel. The room at first glance appeared clean but upon closer inspection, it really wasn't. On our first night, we found two cockroaches please see attached photos  in the bathroom which were reported to the staff and they were very apologetic and got the cleaner to come and pick up the Cockroaches and clean the bathroom again. Next morning we went down for breakfast and the mugs and plates were very dirty, my friend made a cup of tea only to see lipstick stain on the mug which wasn't hers.The food was terrible and always undercooked in the end we decided to eat out of the hotel even though we paid for fullboard because we didn't want to risk getting food poisoning.The staff at the restaurant were very unapproachable, there was one in particular named Carmen, who was very rude at a point, she started pointing at us speaking Spanish to other guests at the hotel and they all started laughing at us. On our last night at the hotel, we found another cockroach this time a big one. We immediately reported it to the staff at reception, again they sent a cleaner to the room but this time before removing the cockroach the cleaner stepped on it and left all the residue on the floor, she then walks away until we asked her to come back and clean it. This was the straw that broke the camel's back, we decided to go to the reception and speak with the manager, however, the manager was unavailable so we had to spoke with the deputy manager who was incredibly rude, offensive and racist.She was unapologetic but offered to change the room, whilst she was making arrangements for the room change she explained to us that it is VERY NORMAL for the hotel to have cockroach because of the hot climate. She then said we should know this because we are also from a hot climate we were all black British. We were all dumbfounded by this comment and decided to make an official complaint to which she replied in a very aggressive tone ""we don't take complaints at the hotel and all complaint needs to be written directly to the government"". She gave us a form and instructed us to complete and return the form before 12 am in order for her to process it.  At 11 pm we returned the completed form to her as instructed only for her to stamps it and inform us that she will no longer be processing it and we should send it to the government ourselves. She also said the turn around for complaints are between 3 to 6 months.When we asked her why she's refusing to process the forms she started shouting in Spanish and randomly said: ""oh well"".The next morning our transferred to the airport was arranged for 7:20 AM. Breakfast was due to start at 7 am but at 7.20 am they did not have any food or drink out.  When we asked the staff what was going on they just shrugged their shoulders and walk off. This is literally the worst hotel I have ever been to.  It is definitely not a fivestar hotel it is more like a poor quality threestar hotel.  There was no customer service and they do not have a complaints procedure.  This experience has put me off ever going back to Tenerife again"

The reviews for this hotel were however very good with the usual one or two exceptions There are always a few where someone blamed the hotel for the poor weather on arrival or expressed surprise and disappointment that they paid for five tourist stars and did not receive the seven star Burg al Arab!!  Ignoring the trials and tribulations of the insanely or commercially motivated reviews left only good things said about all aspects of this hotel so we booked online and paid our money!  Despite me being considered pedantic when it comes to receiving good customer service, we were not disappointed!Upon arrival at 22.30 we enjoyed a professional and friendly service in the reception including a very warm welcome from the Customer Services Manager Margarita who presented her business card and asked to be called at any time if we needed anything at all.  A minor situation with the room two singles after only 31 years of marriage  surely not saw a call to Margarita and the situation was rectified right away.  Rooms are typically Cypriot with full floor tiling throughout, nicely decorated and with fully functioning Air Con.  A pleasant and nicely angled balcony gives virtually all rooms a beach and sea view.  We booked only BB and tended to explore Larnaca and the local village most nights so cannot comment on the dinner service.  Breakfast however was delightful and the pool snacks at lunchtime very well prepared and presented and the service was so fast that if you were slow back to your pool side sun bed the food would beat you to it!!!  I was also impressed by the responsiveness of the food management.  When asked for a minor improvement to the breakfast food service this was put into effect the next day and was still operating on our last day.  Big thanks to Cornel at breakfast.  You could not have been more attentive.  The restaurant crew all worked so hard and we loved our breakfast times in the restaurant overlooking the pool and sea before the real heat of the day arrived.Talking of the poolside; the hotel operate a booking system for the umbrellas and associated sun beds across the whole pool and beach complex.  This worked very well and from the first to the last day we did not have any of the usual hassle up at 5 oclock to secure a position of defending a prime spot once territory had been taken!!   The system worked very well.  Make sure you select a good spot from the outset or if unavailable on day one look at the expiration date and be ready to move when a prime spot becomes available.  Suggestion to Stavros.  It would be good if a staff member checked for expired cards on a daily basis as most of the guests seemed unable to do this for themselves!  I read somewhere that the hotel was stacked out with Russian guests along with some racially motivated comments  not the case!  Breaking news!!  The Russians are now allowed to travel outside the borders of the Soviet Union and would you believe their economy now means some of those folks can afford the same holiday as you  get over it guys.  If it werent the Russians these people were complaining about it would, for the same small minded reasons, be the Germans.  The whole of Southern Europe is now being visited by the residents of the former Soviet Bloc so you will need to go a lot further than Cyprus if you feel the need to avoid this situation.  I believe the reason some of the Russian guests may seem to appear unfriendly is because English is not necessarily a priority for them as a second or even third language so it is probably a confidence as well as cultural thing!  The management of the hotel led by Stavros, were visible throughout the day and night and spoke to my wife and me on several occasions to solicit feedback, explaining that they would rather hear suggestions for improvements right away rather than seeing negative comments on trip advisor.  Why any sane person would wait till they arrived home to mention some minor problem beats me!! We rarely re visit the same location or hotel for our summer vacations but if we were to reconsider this decision then the relaxed and hassle free holiday enjoyed at the Golden Bay Beach Hotel would be the reason.  A big and genuine thank you to the whole team.  Phillip and Tracy.  Want to know more  phillipclegg1@gmail.com"

I explain : they rent bikes less cheaper than in the rest of the city. So we wanted to book 2 there are only 4. But they said it was unbookable, that it was the 1st come 1st served rule.

We made a booking there a few days ago. When we arrived, they said they didn't receive the booking. And they said it the fault of the YHA China website. If you put your hostel on a site for booking, people expect you to look at that site, but that was below these people. They said all the rooms were taken now, but five minutes later a Chinese couple came in, and they gave them a room. Apparently, there is a double standard. When we asked the reception to help us find something else, they wanted to send us to a hostel with only dorms, which only had space for one night, and they were very rude. When we asked for hotels in the neighbourhood they said there were none and were very rude again.This is a very unfriendly, bad hostel. And they call themselves many trees, but there are no trees, it's a shared courtyard in an ugly building."

As if we wouldnt pay for it .the prices at the restaurant and the bar were too expensive a can of Redbull costed 3.50 and in Lidl in Calpe costed 1.50 , for a meal they wanted 37 which included a starter, main course and a desert. The place is too quiet they dont put on the radio or anything. You have to pay 15 for 7 days for the internet which is only for one phone/ device you want to use. You also have to pay extra money for the remote controller which was also 15 because you cant switch the programmes or put the volume on. The rooms were okay..but  it could have been better for the money we payed though. The cleaning service  do not come clean the rooms or bathrooms during the week and the service dont provide enough hygiene they didnt provide us with toilet paper or anything. It was fine with us as we hired a car from victoria car hire  but for someone who doesnt drive or cant afford to hire a car its complicated. A man that lived near us went to the bar and asked them for a toilet paper and they told him you have to buy it your self we do not provide toilet papers. Which was horrible.However i wouldnt advise this holiday resort to anyone beacause the service at the village is awful, mean, not willing to help the people that are there and plus they are racists. Other people that arrived there at night had to sleep outside the restaurant and the service didnt prepare nothing for them. Overall we tried to enjoy the holiday as much as possible and stay out of the hotel as long as possible also."

If I could give this racist poop hole NO stars I would. I haven't lived in Prince Rupert for 5 years and have only stayed at this hotel maybe twice in my life. My boyfriend Josh Bunce and I were in town for the Craft Fair and chose to stay at the highliner. While I was at the fair, my boyfriend went to check us in. The lady working the desk was HEIDI  and upon checking in my boyfriend had a very pleasant conversation with her. My boyfriend sad she was very chatty and bubbly. She was super friendly and helpful and checked my boyfriend in and charged him no problem. When she asked if he would have a guest he said his girlfriend Kylee Ryan would be staying with him. Well it's like a switch was flipped. She suddenly got very uncomfortable and didn't know what to do. My boyfriend was very confused and asked what the problem was. Heidi mentioned that some RYANS were on the banned list and she would have to double check. My boyfriend was even more confused as we have stayed at this hotel maybe twice. He mentioned we were from out of town. I grew up in rupert and there are a lot of ryans here. My grandpa chimed in and mentioned my mothers name and heidi responded sarcastically that she knew my mother very well. Heidi skimmed the banned list 4 times desperately searching for my name. When she didn't find it, she slowly handed my boyfriend the keys and said ""no partying"". My boyfriend picked me up and told me about his experience and how uncomfortable he felt about the way Heidi acted when my family name was mentioned. To clarify, my sister and I went to school with Heidi's daughter and Heidi didn't like my family based on assumptions her daughter made. Fast forward 3 hours and we go to our room, we were on the tenth floor and put our belongings in the room. We went to the front desk because we had a family friend arrive and he needed a room. A different lady was working at this point. When my boyfriend gave her his name, she was confused as his name wasn't in the system. We explained we had just put our things in the room and our keys were working, she asked to see the key and my boyfriend handed it to her and she literally snatched them from him and said ""sorry your room is cancelled."" She would not tell us why it was cancelled or why we weren't even notified. And she would not let us grab our belongings from our cancelled room. We spent 20 minutes trying to let her get our belongings or tell us why the room was cancelled. Finally she gets the manager and he comes in looking grumpy and all huffy immediately. HE WOULD NOT EXPLAIN WHY OUR ROOM WAS CANCELLED!!!! He escorts us to the room, and I am asking him to clarify on what the heck was happening. He was being extremely rude and arrogant and still wouldn't give us answers. I asked if he was kicking us out because I was native and my last name is Ryan and he responded ""we do not want your business."" I was appalled. Haven't been home in years and this is how I was treated trying to stay here. Not to mention my name was not even on the room It was all under my boyfriends name who ISN'T A RYAN obviously. So we had been kicked out by this racist jerk who ASSUMED because I am a ryan that I was going to be partying. He kicked us out on that assumption and Heidi's vendetta against my family. So thanks Heidi  and David  for your absolutely disgusting customer service. Do you not understand where your business is located! Refusing aboriginal people business on disgusting racist prejudice. Is it just me who thinks people working in customer service should not be judgemental, bigotry jerks!! This situation could have been handled way differently. Heidis job is literally to take our money, give us keys and thats that. Not judge people and decides its up to her who can and cannot stay at the Highliner. We immediately left and went to Inn on the harbour literally across the street. Checked in with NO PROBLEM. The lady working was very polite, the room was the same price as the highliner except the rooms at the inn on the harbour are 1000x better than the highliner. We enjoyed our two night stay and the exceptional customer service. I guess I learned my lesson and know where to stay from now on!"

Not because of the accommodations, which were better than average, or because of the location, which was okay though not spectacular. I'm white and my girlfriend is black. I speak fluent Portuguese, but it was her first trip to Brazil so she was at the entry level with the language. We're from the U.S. and are not strangers to funny looks and worse from intolerant strangers. I'm also fairly aware of the forms racism takes in Brazil, and that the image of a black woman who happens to look like a Bahiana and a white man creates certain assumptions in some Brazilians' minds.  But we weren't prepared for what happened at this pousada. Arriving at the pousada door after a Saturday night out, we were let in by the portero on night duty. I told him in a clear voice what room we were staying in, so that he could give us the room key. He immediately informed me in a very stiff manner that ""irregular persons are not allowed in the pousada"" a literal translation of what he said. I suspected racism right away, and asked him what he was talking about. He repeated himself and said I'd have to pay extra to bring a 'guest' in.  Which told me two things: 1 he assumed my girlfriend was a prostitute, and 2 they seem to allow this kind of thing at the pousada. I told him he was being very offensive and racist, and that this was my wife in Brazil there are two definitions of 'wife/husband', one of which is a kind of commonlaw version when two people live together.  I think my vehemence in confronting him caused him to rethink, because he then shuffled some papers on the desk and said he'd confused me with another single guest who was staying at the pousada. This in spite of the fact that I'd clearly stated upon entry what room we were in. I again told him he was racist and that I'd be speaking with the manager. He denied the racism, claiming it was a case of mistaken identity. We got the same song and dance from the manager the next day, and NO APOLOGY FROM THE POUSADA OF ANY KIND, which didn't surprise me much since the manager and the doorman had clearly gotten their stories coordinated.  Though not surprised, this denial only added insult to our injury. I would say these people need to learn how to run a business at the very least. Amateur and parochial. Minus five stars."

Detail mentioned below1, They will tell you it's fully booked even if it's empty  and will be giving you accommodation in higher price room only.  I was given the same but when I stayed realised it was almost empty as I was only one in whole dorm of 8 bed2, Don't even think of exchanging money there Just pay in Euro in case you don't have just exchange outside and pay in Euro. They will reap you in exchange3, Staff are complete Racist, they knew I was not European hence they didn't bother to worry weather I was happy with their decision or not. I saw them talking to others very nicely4, I was planning to stay for a week but decided to stay 2 days after the first dishonest interaction at reception but since I paid I thought of staying one night and leave next day. I asked them I am letting you know one day in advance can I get refund. She just said I can't, not even bother to say anything and was busy watching movie on her computer. I told her very clearly that I travel a lot and this is not acceptable I will write review about you and she still smile and say nothing.Location is the only good thing about hostel nothing else.

However, I would not suggest going if you are a lone female traveller with children,or even a couple with children.  I went alone with my children and the first 2 days were great there was a different lifeguard on each day. They were fine, they allowed my children to enjoy themselves in the pool. I obviously made precautions to put my children in the correct swim gear etc the pool area is lovely and you can easily keep a watchful eye on they as the loungers go right round the pool its small. Day 3 we had a different lifeguard and he was there until the end of my stay. He ruined our holiday! My children werent allowed to do nothing, they werent allowed bouncy balls from the bouncy ball machine at the pool, they werent allowed the lilo or football we purchased from the hotel shop, they werent allowed in the shallow end, they asked why they kept getting shouted at!The rules changed on a daily basis,The lifeguard knew I was alone and targeted me shouting at me constantly. He humiliated me constantly in front of other guests. He understood every word I said but refused to speak English. He was racist, he was sexist and he was trying to intimidate me for 5 days. When he put his rules in place and I was on my balcony he would watch up at me and allow foreign children to do what my children couldnt. I endured 5 days of him watching up at my balcony constantly. The hotel manager didnt want to know and said I need to follow the rules there were no clear rules by the pool so when I questioned the actual rules because they were inconsistent and changed daily and the lifeguard clearly ran the hotel his exact words were I will throw you out of my hotel with your children! My Thomas cook rep tried to help but the hotel refused to liaise with her and she actually paid for me to go out for a day out of good will because she witnessed the abuse for herself! One morning my toaster set alight my room filled with thick black smoke and the hotel staff couldnt care less. Im not the type of person to complain, Ive never complained in my life, Im happy with cheap n cheerful but the customer service in the hotel was appalling. Ive never been victimised for my race or gender before but here I was. Id avoid at all costs if you are English, female and have children. Theres plenty of hotels around Puerto Rico that would be worth spending the extra money for x"

Not suitable for family but suitable for solo/ couples travelers It's still trial and error for them but I'm sure it's gonna be better when it's fully ready. 1 The Room. It's simple but nice The bed is super comfy! Personally i prefer the garden view more than pool view because it offers more privacy.  10/10 for the room. 2 Private Beach. During high tide is beautiful but surely not during low tide. You can expect all beaches at Kuah to be ""meh"" during low tide. You can't swim during low tide and you can see few dogs prevent you from going to the beach during low tide. 7/10 for the private beach. 3 The staffs. Some are friendly, some will only friendly if you're ""white"". You can't work in hospitality industry if you wanna be racist. 4/10 for the staffs. 4 The Surroundings.A bit isolated, but it's their concept. It's not fully done so a bit of construction can be heard. At night, the dogs barking nonstop. The sound of the forest is really calming though. 6/10 for the surrondings."

Check in is at 3pm and we were there for checkin on time only to be told our room is not ready because the previous guest decided to extended their check out hours and they couldn't give us a time of how long we had to wait.Unfriendly receptionist2. False advertisment we have booked a family room 1 queen 2 single bed.The owner/ investor Joe Chong bluntly said, full arrogance that such room does not exist and admits it was false advertising.3. Racist Management, the solution to our situation was to take 2 separate rooms behind facing the construction ground else we can leave if we are not happy with this alternative and apparently all pool facing units are taken there is nothing more he can do for us. No remorse and no apologies, all done full with arrogance and gangster like attitude. Mind you this was after close to an hour waiting to be checked in. During our wait at the lobby we noticed another group of foreigners were facing the very same issue but their matter was handled differently by Joe. He repeatedly apologised to them and gave them an 'upgrade' to side by side pool facing roomswhich during our time was apparently not available and there was nothing he could do about it but when foreigners of a certain skin colour had the same issue everything was possible.4. The resort is located is a rather isolated area which transportation is an issue unless you rent your own car. No eateries walking distance or at the establishment. In my opinion not suitable for families as the rooms are very small, bathrooms have no doors. Don't be fooled by the private beach either. Anything extra you need in the room example hairdryer requires a separate deposit to the on that you have already paid during check in.5. The only good thing about this place is the pool but that is surely not enough for me to recommend this place or ever return to it again. For the price they charge there are many other better resorts in Langkawi with superb customer service and facilities. Potential is there but the group that runs the resort needs to be changed or at least trained. Rude, unprofessional, arrogant and very obviously racist. 6. Also beware that there are CCTV around and they do take your picture without your permission and publish it on social media for advertising purposes."

I have never experienced such racist, atrocious customer service in my life, I have traveled across the world and this was the most horrible experience we ever had.

First time coming to the hotel will be the biggest challenge. because for a strange reason they use do not use the name tivolli inn rather its ""Tropicana Inn"". quite confusing! Even though these are some tiny flaws the most shoking and alarming fact is their staffs! That's the first time I was worried about my security in malaysia with a serious concern of being a victim of racism and hate!  I was a long walk and a hike from the jetty to the hotel. Going in there in my shock and tiredness I was met with person in reception who was from pakistan. Rude as he is with no english he was asking about my nationality. No check in no welcome no request to wait. Acting like a investigation police he started asking all kinds of irritating question. For ur information I am a half malaysian muslim and was travelling with my female friend. After knowing that the guy literally abused me in a racist chant in the desk! I told him it was none of his business and ask him to give me my key. Instead he answered with another conservative religious abuse about my nationality and my race. I received a horrible treatment and rude shouting behaviour in my own country from those guyz from that point onwards! starting from the reception untill the housekeeper everyone is from pakistan and there is no sign of local hospitality or taste. u will be feeling like ur in a radical violent observation of what ur doing with ur family and friends and receive negative feedback time to time! I had the worst experience of my life this time and thought to call the police when I found out one of the housekeepers is peeping through the window to see us in early morning. My God! I checked out immidietly after that.  In a nutshell not what u pay for.

If you ever book here manage to not have a bunk bed in second floor as they do not have side protections and you sleep with the panic that you will follow hard on pavement and bring your own towels. You have to prepare yourself the bed and 2 sheets and a pillow is given. You will be charged for anything else you may require and you have posters allover threatening you for fines up to 5,000 Euro.WHATS THE MATTER WITH THE PILLOWS Its hard as a stone, it looks like is filled with old cotton and robs since its plenty of bumps and very very hard. One of the staff , a youngster probably in its 20, time to time made racist comments and gave ironies about clients after they left the desk. Yeah, i understand Italian very good and i didn't understand were to complain about this behavior.At 9 a clock the bell of a church very close wakes u up. To me that as a good thing and also have some fashion on it. As mentioned the only good thing of this hostel is : location , location, location. But they don't need to profit so much and have a racist staff in their crew just bcs. of location. "

We did not enjoy our stay at this Hotel. The maids were very rude towards us, our rooms were not cleaned and had a very potent smell in the bathroom from the moment we entered. We asked at the reception for a room swap, which they were unable to give us so we had no choice but to stay in the smelly room. We had two rooms, one of the rooms the air conditioner did not work, which we asked for it to be looked at but never did they sort it out or even get looked at, The other room was filled with ants in the bed and on the floor and both rooms smelt absolutely atrociousThe people who were visiting were not friendly at all and as a family we felt very out of place and were continioulsy stared at. This made my children feel very uncomfortable and very awkward.One night the hotel put on a dancing show, which people of all ages took part in, my youngest daughter wanted to take part but no one wanted to even hold her hands in the dance. Some of the staff at the hotel did not advise us about anything the hotel had to offer, whether it be about the bus to go to the beach or about how the wifi worked and the times of each meal. We had to constantly ask about these information from the staff eventhough it is their duty to inform us about their hotel.The only people that were friendly to us were the staffs who worked in the Kitchen and the lady who cleaned the lobby.On a whole we were extremely disappointed with our stay at Angela Beach and would not recommend this Hotel, especially not to a coloured black family or person."

The manager Quinton reassured us that the situation would be handled but still haven't heard from anyone from the property. Quinton and the female chef were very comforting and cracking jokes with us and making sure our order were made even though Alicia showed no concern. I don't think that anyone should work in customer service if they have such hate in their heart. The hotel was beautiful as well as the city. But Alicia really ruined the whole experience.

Since it was too late at night did not realize the issue with the view then. When we woke up in the morning we realized that our so called sea view was blocked almost 70 by the branches of a palm tree.  pic attached. When we complained the next day, we were then offered a room in the lower floor which was not possible then for us to move since we had already unpacked all our luggage. The bigger issue we had was that the room  202 which was offered to us was the ONLY room in the entire hotel with a blocked view and since we were brown skinned it was promptly offered to us! When we complained we were assured that 202 was the only room available at the time which was a completely false statement since the room 203 next to us with an uninterrupted sea view was unoccupied from the date we checked in till the date we checked out.The hotel was unapologetic about our issue and did not consider our complaint to be an issue at all. That's what was even more annoying.My tip: if you are any thing other than Caucasian avoid this racist hotel at any cost!!!"

We ask to change room, they said it's sold out funny because some one came in just right when we were checking in asking if they have any room they said they have 4 left. I then told the guy name Dan that we will go to a different hotel. He said yep but I will charge you for the whole night, he then mumbled to the guy next to him "" Fword China Men"". Well I am not Chinese for one and that's just straight up racist. Not upset at all that they charged us money for staying in the room for 5 minutes, but very disappointed and shocked at the way we were treated, especially by Dan the receptionist. Do not be curious and check out a room, they will charge you  for even if you stay there for 5 minutes. The worst part is that we asked them for a different room but they said no then acted like we were poor immigrants from China. Pretty sad to run into these type of people."

While i prepared to go out in the town, I invited my family whom I was visiting in Guatemala to come up to my room to have a refreshment and I wanted to try some Guatemalan food treats they had brought for me to try. Well, as my family attempted to come up to my room, they very aggressively stopped at the lobby and were told they couldn't come in and they were kicked to sidewalk to wait for me. This is racist against their own Guatemalan people, they may not dress fancy and do not have a lot of money but they are hard working people  they not deserved to be treated as dirt or criminals. I went downstairs to speak to management but he was very demeaning towards mefamily and didn't care to hear my plea to please allow a 2030 minute visit, I even offered to pay, His power ego was bigger that his professionalism and lack of heart.

DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE TREATED LIKE GARBAGE!!!!!!!,"THE MOST RACIST TREATMENT I EVER GOT FROM A HOTEL!!!!!! DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE TREATED LIKE GARBAGE!!!!!!! Our story starts at the end of December 2016 when my boyfriend was supposed to travel to Dubai. He booked a single bed at Montreal Naif Hotel. A couple of days prior to departure, I was able to take off from work and join him as well, so we changed the reservation to a double bed. Once we reach Dubai, after a 24 hour trip, we get to the hotel and discover that we are not allowed to go into the room. THE REASON!! The receptionist told us that interracial couples are NOT ALLOWED TO SLEEP IN THE SAME ROOM AND THEREFORE WE CANNOT GO UPSTAIRS. I want to mention that my boyfriend and I both live in Canada. The receptionist said that it doesn't matter where we live because they could get fined by the police for allowing interracial couples sleep in the same room. They said that it's against the law in Dubai for interracial couples to sleep together. We calmly explained that we are able to pay extra to get the room and we were still denied. At which I asked the receptionist what should we do Should we go sleep on the streets To which he simply gave us a shoulder shrug. I need to mention that this was close to New Years in Dubai and that all hotels were completely booked. Eventually, they started blaming agoda.com, the website through which we booked the room. After being on the phone  with Agoda for hours, the customer service representative said that such law forbidding interracial couples to share a room seems absurd and that they are willing to speak to the hotel manager to clarify the situation on our behalf. Of course, the hotel manager was nowhere to be found for hours. We spent a total of 6 hours in the hotel lobby trying to persuade the receptionist to allow us to enter the room. I'm going to mention again that our trip to Dubai was 24 hours on planes, so we were exhausted. We tried to go up in the room to at least freshen up and leave our luggage in a safe spot and we got called on the phone IMMEDIATELY to come downstairs. At this point, it felt like harassment and racial discrimination.   Eventually, after many long hours and back and forth conversations they allowed us to access our room for an extra cost. They eventually denied all racial discrimination and said that they only wanted us to pay extra and let them know ahead of time. This experience made my boyfriend and I want to NEVER GO BACK TO DUBAI BECAUSE OF THE RACISM AND HORRENDOUS WAY TO TREAT TOURISTS!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!!!!!!"

I didn't know anything about it and never did any research on the resort either.The setting of the resort is beautiful. It's got a beautiful lawn with a nice platform overlooking the river.As the food was included in my trip price I didn't really pay attention to the prices so I can't tell you if it's expensive or not. But I can tell you that it still takes them around 45 minutes to cook everything. The trick is to be earlier than other people so you'll be the first one served or be a lot later so you don't have to wait longer than necessary. They take so long because they don't have anything precooked so there's no waste which I think is a good idea and certainly worth the wait and you'll have everything freshly cooked. Having said that, the food was excellent. I had different things every day of my stay 10 days and all of them were good. I've got absolutely no complaints about the quality of the food. They were very forthcoming in out wishes regarding the food. However, if you find the food expensive, there's a supermarket across the street and there are all kinds of cooking utensils available in the room.One of the downsides is that there are power outages every evening, but that can't be helped by the staff/owners. That happens all around Port St. Johns.Another downside is that they have gasheated water. Which means that when the gas runs out and you're in the shower all of a sudden there's no hot water anymore. Even though that happened to me the chance of that happening is very, very slim. And they fixed us up with a new gastank in notime. So all praise to the staff for taking quick action there.We were notified that ownership had changed a couple of months before and the new owners were trying to get rid of the ""bad"" name they have on the internet. I read the other two reviews and can understand it. I never came across any form or hint of racism in my ten days there.As far as I'm concerned this is now with the new owners a good option if you want to stay around Port St. Johns."

My family and I made constant use of their deck overlooking the river. Rooms: Each unit has two rooms  one with a queen bed, one with bunkbed, small tv, table, sink/fridge/microwave. Everything is very clean. In our 3 night stay, there was not one time the deck was being used. Canoing: For R30 you can rent a canoe for 1/2 day. I took my 8 year old cousin out and we had a blast, very relaxing. CONS:Shower: In our 3 night stay I was not able to have one decent shower. The temperature is temperamental, and even after some maintenance men came to fix it, it still did not work properly. My family and extended family stayed nextdoor to each other, and there shower was just as bad..can you imagine our frustration!Restaurant: DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT eat in the Spotted Grunter restaurant! Upon arrival, all the adults were craving seafood. Being right by the water we thought it'd be delicious  boy were we wrong! We ordered sea food platters prawns, crawfish etc. The manager assured us ""it was to die for"", but that it is cooked slowly and would take 45 min  we agreed it was worth the wait. 1 hr 45 min later we got our food and it was awful! In addition, the kids pizza tasted like cardboard. When we politely told the manager about our dissatisfaction she put her head down, mumbled something and walked away. Racism: On our last night as we had a BBQ outside our cabin, we found ourselves witnessing a completely unnecessary confrontation initiated by the owners husband and wife. At 8:30pm, they accused the Indian family nextdoor of having too many people in the cabin, of ppl complaining of noise certainly not us! and got in the father's face calling him a racist name. The owner apologized to us for our neighbors, and we immediately let her know we have absolutely no problem with the men. It was disgusting to see such ignorance and poor customer service, and we vowed we will never come back."

I was happy with the location and the rooms were very clean.  There is a lovely deck over looking the river which we loved.  We spent as much time there as possible.  We are not a fishing family, but I hear the fishing is great here too.The grounds are lovely with a very beautiful well kept garden.  The braais outside the units were even cleaned and scrubbed every day.  I was very impressed by that.We were excited to have a restaurant on the premises.  Unfortunately this was short lived! The menu prices were very, very high.  When we ordered we were told the meal would take 45 minutes to prepare.  We didn't mind that as they warned us.  Well! It arrived 2 hours later!  Not only did it arrive so late, but it was awful.  When asked if we enjoyed our meal, we very politely mentioned that the wait had been very long and that it wasn't great.  The grumpy manager just gave us a look as if to say she didn't believe us and turned on her heal and quickly disappeared.  We even overheard her in the bar next door telling the owner that we complained and he wasn't concerned either.  I think that is very poor management on their part.We had some Muslim people staying in the unit next door to us and the following night the owners came down to the units and started shouting at them very loudly.  They were being very racist and told them to leave immediately.  I find that unacceptable.  If they had a problem with them, they should have quietly sorted it out, not shout so everyone could hear.  They then had the audacity to apologise to us the next day for the commotion the Muslim people had caused.  They in fact, hadn't bothered us at all.  On those grounds I would never go back there or recommend it to anyone else.Before that all happened, I would have highly recommended the place as I could live with the dinner problem as we just found other places to eat.  It was very clean and well located.  However, I find racism in this day and age in South Africa, absolutely unacceptable."

Totally nasty and lacked any sense of how to service a client. We were on a redeye flight and hadn't slept in 24 hours. We asked to possibly checkin early. He behaved with no compassion as though it was unheard of and stated that the checkin time was 1:30p, instead of saying he would see what he could do. I began to fall asleep in the living room space. He was clearly a control freak and couldn't handle us hanging in the living room and ended up getting us a room earlier.He had mentioned that day that check out time was noon, however, the next morning he called the room demanding that we leave earlier than check out time then screamed it was because we checked in early. As I waited for my friend to come out, he rudely screamed at me saying we had caused problems while telling his mother or some elderly lady who tried to get me to wait outside. I refused and she asked if I was African. I was appalled at her racist nature and sarcastically said yes, just like you...Anyway, everywhere else we have stayed has been amazing.

No special attention for the prestige guests no welcome in the room No coffee and tea facilities  No complimentary water in the room  You are still in the middle ages and you need to pay your SAFE   hairdryer is also from Mathusalem  and wall mounted, the flat screen with a dimension that you use nowadays for your computer  No duvet, still using the old blanket.And using beach towels to stop the rain coming in should not be done in a five star hotel.Also 2 women fell at the buffet during our stay so there is certainly a security problem with the floor around the buffet.Last but not least, we already stayed three days at the hotel when my husband, who was singled out by the lobby boy amongst all the people in the lobby with a question: WHERE ARE YOU GOING  Would that anything have to do with the colour of his BLACK skin  This ruined our holiday that after 3 days you do not know your guests and there was only 1 black person in the hotel as guest.  I find this from RUI hotels limit and I let you to be the decision maker of this racist approach.  Anyway this ruined our holiday in a so called 5 star palace sold by TUI as prestige hotel."

Staff are definitely  white fearing individuals. All white individuals needs are met before any other guests of colour. Made us feel really uncomfortable and unimportant even though we pay the same price if not more. Security guards are also racist and clearly have a problem with younger individuals as theyd pick on us at least twice a day maybe even three; harassing us with the same questions every time they saw us; they even went as far as to ask us if we stayed there. As if white or Europeans are the only individuals that can afford such a place.  Pretty sure theyre not even natives of the country and they have the audacity to pick on other tourists. Eden Bleu really needs to look into the way they treat guests of colour especially because their country is made up of majority individuals of colour. Very disappointed."

All the details in the room are excellent. Nice bathroom, comfortable king sized bed and the balcony overlooking the view. Pool area is always clean and properly maintained. They also offer airport shuttle/taxi for 27 which is a 10 minuteride to the hotel. Guests can avail free daily shuttle to the Beau Vallon beach with free use of beach towel. I would like to thank Amanda, Veronica and the other lady in the reception who were very nice and caring so as the guys in the concierge as they let us leave our bags in the hotel for one week even after our checkout date. One thing I don't understand are the waitresses in the dining area for the breakfast buffet who seem to only focus in serving coffee to men. There were only three occupied tables that time and they did not seem to care offering me coffee, when a guy came, the waitress immediately offered him coffee. I am not sure if they are just being racist or I don't know what to say..  Also, when housekeeping cleaned the room it took very long time and she left the floor slightly wet from mopping that I had to dry it for 15 minutes with a fan so I won't leave shoe marks on the floor. I guess housekeepers should be trained to properly clean and dry the room. Anyways, since the receptionists are very nice and the hotel facilities are excellent, I did enjoy my stay."

The room that we got for almost 150 euro was a disaster. when we got in, there were like 30 C degrees in the room, we tried to open the windows but that was not possible, one was nailed and the other one was just broken, there was quite a lot of dust all over, the bathroom door could't be shut, the shower drain was clogged, we had to stay in the water while showering, and get out of it as soon as possible to avoid the water to run over the shower tub, even so the water somehow managed to get in and the floor was disgusting. the liquid soap they have is so full of chemicals that requires a warning on the bottle ,, not allowed to be used by children'' , the carpets where stained    4. if you are there while a religious holiday you will be woken up by the church bells5. you need the TV remote from the reception if you wanna watch TV6. they gave us a password and a username for WiFi, but surprise it didn t worked, our phones couldn t even find the WiFi network."

One of the staff members handed us a brochure for consideration. While stepping out one shabby looking lady barged onto us and snatched the brochure from my Dad's hand saying they only give this to foreigners and was very rude in her behavior.  She called herself a manager but believe me she had no sense of what hospitality industry is all about, cant believe the managed hired her as the hotel manager. Her remarks were quite racist and we are quite outraged with this behavior. I am looking for a public apology from hotel management on this forum  for insulting Indians and if no action is taken against this so called lady manager I am sure to take this ahead with tourism authorities and government agencies."

Jaya has a wellpracticed, slow, genteel manner, full of yes madam this and that. But this surface politeness is deeply deceptive; know that if you challenge him, the ugliness of his personality will come out.My driver and I frequently shared meals around the country, as is the case with many foreign tourists and their drivers/guides. We never imagined this nonissue would turn into a hostile crisis at this guesthouse. After all, this is a decision solely up to us  whether we dine together is something between me and my driver; its not up to anyone else to dictate.We had informed Jaya and his wife that we both planned to have dinner at the guesthouse my driver had paid for a room there too. Shortly before dinner was ready, the wife knocked on my door and told me it would be ready soon. I asked her to let my driver know too, and she gave me a strange excuse that he would need to eat later at a separate table because his food needed to be spicier. Minutes later, Jaya also knocked on my door and reiterated the same thing. The whole thing felt very strange.Soon after, Jaya brought me out to the dining room, where I sat at the main table with a friendly couple from New Zealand. I mentioned to them in passing that my driver was still waiting to eat, apparently because separate food was being prepared for him. The New Zealand couple rightly said there was plenty of food indeed, with the huge spread of more than a dozen dishes, there was probably enough food to feed six people, and why dont you just knock on his door and get him to join us This made obvious sense  there was plenty of food to go around, so why should he wait any longer We had eaten lunch together earlier in the day, so I knew my driver hadnt eaten in nearly five hours. My driver was surprised when I told him dinner had started without him, and once I returned with him to the dining room, mayhem ensued with Jaya and his wife, who bitterly argued with us back and forth that my driver was not allowed to sit at the table, even though I made it clear that both the New Zealand couple and I were perfectly fine with it. You would have thought that with the ferocity of their arguments that my driver was committing a serious crime, not simply trying to eat! Jaya and his wife flung around all sorts of excuses, and finally the real truth came out: Jaya does not want locals and tourists to mix. Essentially, in his ridiculously racist mind, my lowly local driver is only allowed to come out and show his face once all the foreign tourists have left the room.Jaya's wife finally said that if you want him to eat at the table with you, you need to pay the foreigner price for his dinner. To which I obviously said fine, just so the poor guy could eat! After more arguing in Sinhalese with my driver, she went into the kitchen and brought him back a separate plate of food  even though he could finally sit with us, he was not allowed to touch the dishes on the table, only eat from that one plate of food! It was absolutely ridiculous  you would think we were in British colonial Sri Lanka, not the 21st century. Both my driver and I were obviously unsettled and upset by the incident. I assure you this was no misunderstanding because of language my driver got the full version in Sinhalese but a very disheartening, unnecessary, ugly act of racism and classicism by the owners.From the dinner onward, Jaya proceeded to give me the cold shoulder, staring at me in stony silence until checkout the next day. Even when I returned from the Yala morning safari note that Jaya charged me Rs 6500 for the trip, while everyone else on my Jeep was charged Rs 5500 by their hotel, the same ridiculous racism happened again when I was served a late breakfast. Both Jaya and his wife suddenly claimed that breakfast was only included in my room rate, not my drivers room rate. If I wanted him to eat with me, I would need to pay an additional fee. To which I told Jaya flat out, Im going to take my driver out to a nice restaurant, as I prefer to spend my money elsewhere. At that, Jaya turned his back on me and walked away in anger.The final bill I paid for that sickening dinner was Rs 600 for me and Rs 700 for my driver, plus 10 service what service! The wife claimed that the small piece of chicken on his plate merited an extra 100 rupees. This is not a lot of money to tourists, but locally its a lot, and I can tell you that my driver and I have had shared much better meals together for a total of less than 700 rupees. Moreover, drivers who lodge at hotels are typically given a courtesy meal in their room rate, and he got nothing but a huge helping of racism. Clearly, this couple saw it as yet another opportunity to profit, even if they couldnt get their racist way in the end. But its not the money Im upset about  but their shockingly racist, classist attitudes, and subsequent hostility toward me and my driver when we rightly challenged their ridiculousness. This horrible couple needs to wake up to the reality that the colonial period is long over."

He never replied the complaint with smile and I wasn't even rude to him just asked why the water didn't run out and the water heaters was not working.He asked me: "" Do you have any kind of this problem in your country""I answered: For 75 per day, No I never find any situation like this in any country and I traveled many countries even to Africa.He said, well..that's your problem, here..we face the problem.That's not the way you treat your customer and I'd rather stay at the Plaza Hotel for the price 80 per day.

He asked his staff to call me to come to his office to pay the bill while I was eating my breakfast. The menu for breakfast doesn't change everyday, so you will eat the same menu. Sometimes his expression is just unconcerned with my complain about my room, for example when the water doesn't come in the morning, or when flush of the toilet is being clogged.  He is very rude with his staff. Most of the staff who work are local women. I don't want to call him as a racist but it happens. You can do a short interview with the women staff to know how the manager treat them. However, the staff are very friendly. They will treat you better and always be ready to service you"

I have just returned from zefir, and would like to clear them up. For us English tourists. food, the food is brilliant although by the end of the week it does get a little boring.But there are numerous food stands around the hotel for like 3 6 lev. Just watch out for the chicken kebabs as tasty as they are, I still have the trots.rooms and facilities, the room we got was a little bit small and we had to pay 5 lev a day for air conditioning which we thought abit bad as it should have been included! The hotel is very clean and the pool is great, although. People do leave towels on the sun beds over night, a sign needs to be put up saying, any towels left over night will be removed, as we spent our holiday sunbathing on chairs... it is fair  enough to get up early and nab sun beds, but over night takes the piss. the wristbands, I see loads of people on here crying about the wristbands. English gpb is the strongest currency. The drinks are about 50p after 11pm so stop your crying. In all honesty sunny beach offers so much to do. Who wants to sit in the hotel anywaystaff, we had absolutely no problems with the staff, my friend loved the animation team they were pretty cool. The guys in the pool bar are great. I see alot of reviews  moan about the girl on the bar fatme, the first night I went down she and 2 other girls on the bar laughed at me speaking in Bulgarian. And I just thought it was funny, and throughout the week she was just more friendly. Us English are racist to foreigners and tourists. Let them take the piss out of us haha. We are all alcoholics when we travel.Overall the stay was great fun loads to do, the train outside runs from 7am  12am costs 6lev and takes you to the attraction where you will have the greatest nights of your life. But beware they water down drinks and charge 1lev every time you need the toilet. Its about a 30min walk back for the night owls after partying. Don't get taxis they just take the piss.Thank you zefir for a.great holiday and I will most likely return soon :D"

We soon discovered as well as being the most rude member of hotel staff we have  ever met there was also a cash point two minutes walk away . Her rudeness increased as the week went on , we also noticed as soon as some of our staff saw our ""green band of shame "" which showed we were from the UK we were treated apalingly! However to the hotels credit Thomas behind the pool bar was really lovely and hard working and should probably  get a promotion . Also the childrens entertainer girl  and a guy called the animator were nothing but smiley and friendly all week. The rude girl called Fatma should be avoided at all costs ! I also unwittingly started an argument amongst two members of staff as I asked for some milk. The waitress was yelling ""no milk no milk"" at me while the chef was yelling at her then they both walked off arguing leaving me with no milk . It was really weird. We also asked about air con in our room and told we would have to pay extra , apparently this varied between five and ten levs depending on where you were from. However the cleaners who were absolutely lovely and cleaned our room daily switched it on for us mid week and we didn't pay anything . I think it was by accident but it was much needed as without it we had to leave our window open at night and the street is really noisy as there is a pub across  the road which has karaoke until the early hours of the morning and the seagulls are crazy noisy ! Despite all of this it turned into a comical week as the staff were so terrible and we managed to laugh it off and enjoy our holiday . There is a nice beach bar called Musai nearby and if you go into old Nesebar there are some great restaurants and museums. If you head to sunny beach be prepared for crazy bars , bungee jumps ,all night markets , strip clubs and lots of pissed people! I have to say it was an experience I will never forget !"

Where do I start  We paid for 3 star and expected 3 star but this place is less than 2 star.The staff are miserable and won't even look at you never mind acknowledge you. The food is bland, boring and repetitive.The rooms are very basic and old fashioned, though ours was clean.The beds are almost solid and very uncomfortable  I had bad shoulders and back by the end of the week just from the beds.The 'All Inclusive' wasn't 24 hour for the British clients, but it WAS 24 hour for the German clients, we weren't offered an upgrade at all, when we asked about an upgrade we were told, if you want to upgrade it'll cost you another 200 that only includes drinks 24/7. Really not worth it.They won't let you have a cup of tea or coffee with your lunch or dinner, it's only available at breakfast.There were a few live electrical sockets hanging off the wall, very dangerous.The cleaners don't knock before entering your room, I was walked in on a few times while I was getting dressed.The animation team were good but had very limited resources.There was no evening entertainment for adults only a short disco by the pool for small children.On 'All Inclusive', drinks, including soft drinks and alcohol were only available from 11am until 11pm at which time they would close the outside bar and switch the lights off leaving clients sat outside in complete darkness, but German All Inclusive was 24/7.We arrived early Saturday morning and were leaving the following Friday evening, so actually stayed 6 nights, checkout is noon, we were then charged to be able keep the room for an extra 4 hours even though we had paid for 7 nights  RIP OFF!In my opinion this hotel and it's staff are very racist!I would NEVER go back there and would not recommend this hotel to anyone."

INCLUDING DISH SOAP and a pool. You may think the price is good but please factor in that you have to pay 2.50Euro to get from Rhodos to Faliraki and another 2.50 to get back again. You may think you could just walk. I thought so too. It took 5 hours. The man that runs the place is nice but his wife is awful. I couldn't believe how openly racist she was. It was really uncomfortable. She just kept going on and on about her small minded views. I thought it was beyond unprofessional. Also, keep in mind you can't bring your own drinks so if you want to enjoy a drink by the pool you'll have to pay for it. The reception is only open for a couple hours everyday so outside of that if you need anything you're on your own.Overall I would say DON'T SUPPORT RACISM! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"

Fresh, crisp towels every morning, and good quality sheets and pillows. The location of breakfast makes for a wonderful start to the day, although the breakfasts themselves are just about OK, and no fruit is offered. Their ""wine experience"" is a good one. Le Cinque Terre produces some lovely whites, and the sommelier was very knowledgeable.NEGATIVES, NEGATIVES, NEGATIVES: The accommodation is best likened to a favela in Rio de Janeiro. The Gianni Franzi is not a hotel by any stretch of the imagination, but rather a collection of disparate rooms spread across a few buildings some hundred steep steps away from the main port and reached through tall, dark, narrow alleyways.  Our room was extremely basic; it was very small, had no air conditioning although there was a fan, and the single window was headheight to all passersby who kept peering in, thus making it impossible for us to have the window kept open.  I've never slept on a shorter bed meant for an adult! At  5'6"" my feet were just barely accommodated. The ABSOLUTELY WORST part of the Gianni Franzi is their socalled reception staff barmaids at the owner's restaurant. First off, they are unprofessional  they got our reservations wrong several times thank goodness I emailed twice to check before arriving. Secondly, they have no idea of proper customer service and their approach to problemsolving is to shout and gesticulate and keep repeating themselves ever louder and with more gestures. But the absolute clincher is the outrageously RACIST remark that one of them was heard to make to some guests who were checking out. Having lived in several multiracial countries for a long time, I can say that I have never, ever experienced firsthand anyone actually making such a disgustingly racist remark, the likes of which I can't repeat. The second 'receptionist', instead of apologising for her colleague, tried to cover it up in a very stupid way which was just as racist as the first remark. We were totally disgusted by this experience and checked out the same day. We took the train to Genova where we found a fantastic boutique hotel in the historical centre, with two wonderful suites that cost us less than our rooms in thefavelathatistheGianniFranzi, and which had highly professional and wonderfully hospitable staff."

AVOID !!!,"It is the most RACIST hotel I ever stayed! Not Asianfriendly. The front office staff is super racist and only favor Caucasian or White guests.I arrived at the hotel around 8 or 9ish pm. The IHG member checkin area was not staffed, so I queued up near the counter. I have been waiting there for couple minutes, and more people showed up and lined up after me. Then, two arrogant White men just cut the line and approached one of the front desk staff after the staff just finished checking in another guest. I politely talked to the two White men about the line in case they missed it. They took a peak and ignored what I just said. What's more furious is the front desk lady started to check in the two White men and ignoring the long line and the fact that they were cutting the line! I complained to the lady who checked in me, and she did not bother to apologize and reacted like it's not her business. Later, a lady in a suit approached and welcomed me as a Spire member. I complained to her about it once again, and she kept saying we upgraded your room but no apology at all. It turned out my room got upgraded to a higher floor, but the room type was exactly what I booked. I am Chinese and IHG Spire member. I am grateful for the upgrade but really disappointed about the racism experience, especially given that I am a Chinese staying in a hotel in China and discriminated for being a Chinese."

I was incorrect..........My husband was made several keys by different staff which none worked. He ended up sleeping in the parking lot in his vehicle overnight as he attempted to waive, knock on the window to be let in with no response. As it was the middle of the night. He stated she say him but refused to open the door. Im not sure if it was due to race or profile. He is a large guy football player build and due to his job as a promoter he wheres a lot of jewelry but when he finally got in the next morning the housekeeper in front of the door was telling him that someone went into rooms andnstole kureigs, chairs and towels. I called the front desk the light before for his physical key because I had a digital key it did not allow 2 phones access. I brought this to the attention of 2 young women the next day as they were speaking about partying. They never apologized but kept stating the doors should never be locked and asking me the ladys name who was on shift . When checking out I attempted the same thing expecting my money back as my husband wasnt able to sleep in the room. She said sorry a manager would call me in 3 days. I went to a different hotel after this contacted corporate and was promised a refund as I called to speck with a manager personal and was told she informed the young lady when I was checking out to provide me bonus points. SERIOUSLY!!! I was promised a refund after Corp reaches the GM I looked in my account the next day and saw not on did the charge me for all day and it had cleared but the again had lots of money on hold status. I called to speak with GM directly to demand all money back and was told he/she wasnt there then in a meeting and would call me back........nothing.

They like the swimming pool and the kids facilities. However, the PS3 station was not working on the first day, it took  7 hours for the maintenance team to confirm that the playstation is not working and they will change it on the next day for us. On the next day, playstation is changed. However, remote Controllers are not tested if they are working.. obviously they are not working... another 2 hours of waiting again... kids are quite disappointed with the playstation for not able to play on the first day. Duty manager Asvaty offered us with deducted room rate and igh points and a brownie for all these issues... I was delighted with the good attitude from the receptionist and duty manager.On the next day morning, we went down to hotel cafe for breakfast, Susie served us at the entrance of cafe, at that time cafe is busy as usual. We asked for a big table for 6 persons, as we have 3 young kids, one of them is 3 years old. She was reluctant to go in or ask other staff, and told us that no big table, we need to split to 2 small tables. Furthermore she said we already have 1 person came down before us, which we did not.. we as a family with young kids.. everyone goes everywhere together. She dropped that topic, and continue to asked us to split if not have to take the big table under the sun without shade. In my mind, I was thinking will she take that seat if she in my position I told her let me think, then just had a short talk with my hubby, less than 5 sec. She asked us to help her and dont make things complicated with unhappy facial. Im very puzzled why she said that, but did not argue with her.. we decided spilt table, but want 2 tables to be near to each other, so that we can take care of our children. Again, without checking table availability by herself or her staff, she continued to stand there and said no tables near to each other.. we need to split with 2 far tables away! This time, Im pissed and I walked in there cafe and checked it by myself. There are more than 5 big tables are available, some are clean tables some are dirty. I asked my family to come over to join me with the big tables. I did her job and she did not say anything about it, just insisted no big table for us, this is very lousy service that I ever experienced. One more unprofessional and racist which I noticed from her is when I walked to search the table, she immediately changed to smiley facial, and turned to the back forgein white guests, very warmly apologised to them for keep them waiting.. the whole episode of this, making me feel like Holiday Inn service staff is very unprofessional and racist!!!! On the first day, I told my husband we shall come back again on Dec for the kids holiday, after this bad and awful experience, Im not sure if I will come back again. You should learn from Starbucks, close the hotels and have a racist training for all your staff."

The hotel is very dated and is in desperate need of a major refurbishment.  At this moment I would not advise anyone to book this hotel if it maintains its current standards of service.   Travelled with my young family and disabled mother and without wishing to sound racist, we were very intimidated by the muslims wearing veils and their general behaviour ie some actually spat at my children in the pool. The staff were fully aware of this behaviour but seemed to condone it as the whites were in the minority. Didn't serve pork either  only seemed to cater for muslim tastes rather than an international cuisine.  Don't bother going to this hotel, there are plenty of other four stars which are actually four stars and are of a better quality and service."

But the the experience i had with the managers was another story. The called Khanyi she is not friendly at all, but maybe that how she was thought to be not friendly to black clients. Then the Bad part about this hotel was when the motor bikes guests booked the hotel, everything started changing for us black guests. we were chased away from eating a buffet with the other guests, and if we were dishing up this guy Willoh or i dont remember his name who was at the buffet had so many question about , you guys dish up a lot of food and again you still eating he had a lot to say to us black people.I'm not racist , that why i hate it when someone becomes racists to us. The guy who was in charge of our conference venue...I give him 100 , he is very good with his guests.All i can say is this , Look into your managers, they are not doing their jobs right."

You could tell it was quite old from the decor. Our room was for 3 people and actually had a second level where there was a bed in an attic type of thing. And it had its own little balcony. It had a very cool view of the rooftops in the city. And despite its old age, it had great air conditioning. It has a great location and is close to the main square. The hotel staff  at reception especially  were phenomenal.The only thing is that there are two very racist statues in the lobby when you first walk in. I wish they would remove them."
Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg187870d232953r427862091HotelGiorgioneVeniceVeneto.html,Date of stay: October 2016,Hotel Giorgione,Europe,Italy,Veneto,unknown,Racist Front Desk Officer Mauro,"We booked our room through Kayak which redirected us to happyrooms and for whatever reason, the booking agency happyrooms failed to pass the number of guests to the hotel. We booked the room for 2 adults and 1 infant 10 months old while the booking agency passed the information to your hotel as 2 adults. While checking in, Mauro was curt and told us that he can't allow the baby 10 months old to check in with us since we hadn't mentioned it in our booking but he being broad minded that's how it looked like he would allow, but we may be charged extra for the infant.We have faced this situation before as some booking agencies don't consider infants under 1 year old, that cosleeps with parents, as ""child"". When we asked him why would we be charged extra when the infant is going to cosleep in the same bed, Mauro almost accused us, as if we were sneakily trying to bring in another person to stay with us. He also remarked that, ""May be in your country, you can book a hotel for 2 people and let 8 stay, but it doesn't work like that in Italy"".  He assumed and accused us as if we had intentionally left out our infant in the list of people staying with us. When we tried to explain him our point we were asked to first listen to what he had to say and we were lectured for about five to ten minutes wherein, he remarked, ""May be in your country, you can book a hotel for 2 people and let 8 stay, but it doesn't work like that in Italy"". With what temerity did he utter those words Looking at our skin tone and assuming stereotypesWe would like to ask Mauro, if he had ever visited our country, Singapore. Singapore is a thousand times systematic and organised than Italy and please be mindful of your words. We don't write reviews complaining unclean linens or toilets, because we believe, you get what you pay for. But service and attitude That has to be top notch, regardless of the star rating if the hotel.Mauro also told us that, he will have to ""withheld"" our passports for 30 minutes for police verification and we we were made to wait for nearly 45 minutes at the reception before we got our keys. But our passports weren't given back to us and when asked again to another receptionist he told the same reason. We asked him to take a photocopy and give our passports back which is the norm in every hotel and yes we got it after another ten minutes. Why was our room not ready, despite we checking in after almost 2 hours past the ""Checkin"" time When the fault was on your end, why were we blamed forWe totally understand and agree that there was an error in the booking that was neither our fault nor yours. But the way you talk to your customers is unacceptable. Treating customers like criminals and ""withholding"" passports and making racial taunts at them Horrible experience.On the plus side, Andrea was very helpful and so was the other receptionist forgot his name, a short guy with spectacles. The breakfast was also good. I would have easily given this hotel a 4 star rating, but racism has absolutely no excuse and I'm shocked and horrified by the experience I received. Hope this review helps other prospective Venice tourists."

I then discovered Green Dot Travel, would highly recommend going through this company ask for Rinkal they were so hopeful. We arrived just before dinner on the 29th October, and we were completely blown away; yes it's probably not 5 stars by some peoples standards if you go to Jamaica and places like that... but for two 18 year olds, Beach Club Doganay was out of this world. Our transfer had took about an hour and a half I'd recommend going with smaller companies as there is less drop offs and our friends took 3 hours with their transfer. We were taken up to our room very quickly and we were VERY HAPPY with it, found the extra single bed odd but hey ho, just used it to put out bags on as we packed our clothes away etc. Loved that they had a bath, found the tap a bit rubbish so I'd run it with the shower head, but I couldn't complain as I was just happy to have a bath really haha. The food was great and my boyfriend loved it, but after about 4 days it was getting a bit repetitive and they stopped the live cooking outside as the end of season was nearing. We were completely gutted that we never got to eat at the a la carte, we went to book a table and they were fully booked then closing 4 days before our stay was over! Another complaint was the  poor quality of desserts, I have a proper sweet tooth but found nothing very nice the whole week... I couldn't see any evidence of racism from the Turkish staff towards the English till about half way through the week where one of the waiters with filthy fingernails ew, would put extras in the cocktails for the Russians then ask us English to pay extra or point blank refuse, we ended up reporting him to the night manager and he never bothered us again! Entertainment was great on the nights we went to them but not long enough in all honesty, the free shuttle bus was brilliant too but we also caught the other bus on occasions and that was only about 1 anyway. The walls were a bit thin in the rooms too, I kept hearing an Arabic man singing in the shower when I went in the bathroom, the free use of the safe was good also. Mini fridge was restocked daily, but our friends on the first floor didn't get this treatment. We found some good television for when we were getting ready on the nights etc, which was good. The phones to buy phone cards for were rubbish and wouldn't phone back to the UK, i'd suggest using the machines in Alanya harbour rather than the ones in the hotel by the shop. The indoor pool should have been heated really, i think the idea of free turkish bath and sauna was good but i didn't fancy having a fat greasy man rubbing me down in all honesty... I nearly had an asthma attack in the sauna and it burnt the inside of my nostrils but don't let that put you off as I'm probably a bit of a drama queen aha.All in all a really good stay, I'd suggest going to Kleopatra Beach as the sand is marginally better than that of the private beach and it doesn't cost much to hire a sunbed for the day, the selection of all inclusive drinks was excellent and I really liked the seating area near reception, would recommend to others, and I myself would come back if I hadn't already been to Turkey a few times. Really good value for money!"
Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg297961d548362r184233560BeachClubDoganayAlanyaTurkishMediterraneanCoast.html,Date of stay: November 2013,Beach Club Doganay,Europe,Turkey,Turkish Mediterranean Coast,unknown,"Poor management, racist staff","I have stayed in many nonEuropean 5 star hotels and know what to expect. Last year we stayed at the Viking Star in Kemer also Turkey which we gave 5 stars to on Tripadvisor and paid a similar price for. However, this hotel was extremely poor in comparison. It was no 8 on Tripadvisor when we booked and is now no 20. Having looked at other reviews on this website, we can only conclude that different people receive different treatment at Beach Club Doganay or standards have dropped a lot.Our rooms were grubby and dirty see pics, dirty carpets, damaged bathroom, dirty staff area directly outside our rooms where staff would sit on the floor at different times of the day, blocked bathtub that was not fixed despite request. Two days after raising the issues we were offered a familly room which we did not accept as it was smaller than the two rooms we had paid for. We were then showed a larger clean suite but were asked for 50 euros per night extra, when we refused to pay the manager said 30 euros. When we said we had paid for 2 rooms already and were not happy, they eventually offered two cleaner rooms which we settled into.This hotel is unique in that the management do not care about customer experience. I showed the General Manager Mr Mustafa the pictures I have posted here as well as the Front of House Manager. The General Manager just made excuses that the room would be refurbished after the season offering no alternatives and the Front of House manager was just plain rude, with no manners in how he dealt with guests. Staff in general, apart from reception staff, were not friendly or helpful.On top of all of this, two in our group of 6 became sick with severe stomach bugs during the trip. My wife met a lady from Manchester in the restaurant who told us her son amongst other guests were also very sick with the same thing, her son ending up in hospital on a drip for two days. She kindly gave us some mild tablets to settle the stomach. On return to the UK our doctor said the illness was most likely due to poor food hygiene, and I did notice flys sitting on food during breakfast.I also felt that one waiter in the restaurant in particular was racist. He would pull out chairs for European guests but when we asked for basic things like cutlery he would ignore us. I mentioned this to the waiter earlier on and to one of the managers on my last day when he was in the restaurant, he seemed to take the issue seriously but then approached the waiter, chuckled something and walked on.One big negative was that the indoor pool is not heated and cannot be heated. For a late season holiday this is a must, as our children normally spend two hours a day in the pool during holidays. This was not possible at this hotel.The hotel is isolated and Alanya has little to offer apart from the Castle and the beach. The beaches in south Turkey are poor compared to other countries we have visited with stony/grainy sand and narrow strips of beach.I would not visit this hotel again or recommend it to anyone as I have done with Viking Star. Overall we had a poor experience which spoilt our holiday. There are many other hotels in the area, don't take the risk  book elsewhere."
Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg187323d2481544r581474111WaldorfAstoriaBerlinBerlin.html,Date of stay: May 2018,Waldorf Astoria Berlin,Europe,Germany,Berlin,unknown,"Awesome Property, Snobbish  Unfriendly Staff","Booked room ""King Delux with View"". While booking the hotel the pictures which hotel has uploaded were not true and deceiving. The room category I booked the pictures were showing the view of the church with bathroom tub facing it, that was the reason to book the room which is eastside facing. To my surprise, when i reached the reception the receptionist ""Tatjana Shorling"" talks me into having a west side room which is suppose to be equally exciting according to her. Upon going to that room 1109, i see construction site from my room, i come down with my luggage complaining that this is not the room i booked, I show her my booking pictures of my room category. She says, these pictures are from our junior suite bathroom, and you have booked King Delux with VIEW, so the view could be anything and these are just some random pictures uploaded for the room category you have booked. So I was like ""Wow, waldorf astoria does that, so far the room category from any other hotels i book online, i always get the same or similar, not completely opposite of what is shown to me as a customer"" My argument was: So that means your marketing department has uploaded the pictures of Junior suite bathroom view to the church only to deceive customers booking the room and then you give them a view of noisy constructions site west side room claiming this is what you will get as a VIEW which is mentioned in your booking. I asked well if the view of the west side construction site is so exciting, why don't your marketing team uploads the pictures of that view and let the customers book the room anyway. Why this making a fool out of customers and lying to them. To my surprise, they did have the room with east church facing which Later she supposedly pretending to do me a favour gives me room, 1303 Which is still not the one I had originally booked had finally the west side church view. It was around 9pm checkin and having the room available with church facing, but not giving it to me and talking me into taking a room with an inferior view was very mean and unfriendly of her and its absolutely unfair trade practice to show something else online and give something else. Later that evening around midnight passing through the reception, I asked ""Mr.Joshua Beckel"" on the reception ""What time is the breakfast from tomorrow morning"" His reply ""Its from 6:30am to 10:30pm, but it depends if its included in your room tariff or not"". I have never heard a remark like this before after 25 years of my travelling. According to me while checking in, the receptionist, does ask you ""your room doesn't include a breakfast would you like to add it or the host at breakfast room informs you after asking your room number, that sir your room doesn't include breakfast and this will be additional charges. These are the two people you expect to get this information from generally, but asking just for the timing of the breakfast and the guy replies ""It depends if it's included in your room tariff or not"" is purely racial based. He wouldn't dare say that to some rich European guy wearing suit and Rolex on, walking around. I was very upset, and wanted to talk to the manager, who refused to meet and then i was sent the business development head Mr Sean Woods to listen to my complaint, and all he did was bragging about ""We are Waldorf Astoria"" ""If you have been traveling for so long, you should know germans talk like this, this how they talk"" blah blah blah. I told him, I am sorry but I do not agree with you, I have been to cheaper hotels than yours and I have been coming to Germany for 25 years for business, and never experienced this kind of biased treatment and judgemental remarks from the hotel staff, that it is the reason it's coming as a shock to me. Because my impression of Germans has been always straightforward yet friendly to their guests. Finally, next day i have moved the room which I was originally shown the pictures of online and which i had booked, but after all this talking and hassle. Staff at concierge, bell boy, breakfast room were very friendly. I would have checked out of this hotel for sure next day, if i hadn't set up all my clients meetings in this hotel already."

Racist and rude owner!,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel after looking at the information provided but the information written has nothing to do with what we experienced. First of all the hotel does not have spacious rooms as stated. One of the two rooms we booked was different from the other and was as spacious as a coffin. Secondly the rooms are definitely not soundproof as we could hear our neighboring rooms' conversations. The hotel owners have 4 cats which live in the hotel and walk around in the kitchen, on our towels, bed sheets practically everywhere!!! Hotel smelled of cat urine.As my sister in law is allergic to cats and as the hotel did not provide the same room as seen on the pictures, they had to cancel their room. The owners charged them for a cancellation fee which they did not have a right to as they provided erroneous information and they duped us. Not only they overcharged us but the owner was insolent and very rude. The worse part was when the owner made screamed at us, made racist comments and told his wife they shouldn't accept our kind in their hotel."

We are a white American family and we ended up with an empty extra room bc our kids wanted to stay altogether in their own room.  The extra room was nonrefundable so we offered it our safari guide, rather than leave it emptybutpaidfor.  The manager refused to allow this and he would not budge, even when we pointed out that we paid for the room so we should be allowed our guest/friend to stay.  The manager assured us that the guides'/drivers' quarters were lovely so we asked our friend to take photographs.  The pictures revealed abominable conditions:  filthy, crowded and with overflowing toilets.  That is where he stayed, while our luxurious extra room remained empty.  We did try to leave and stay elsewhere but everything was booked.  The management also discouraged us form having our guide dine with us  they eventually allowed it, but charged us a ridiculous price in trying to dissuade us form doing so.  He was the only African man in the dining room, so I guess their tactics are normally successful.  Other highend lodges we stayed in did not have these same segregated policies  many encourage guides and families to dine together and provide the same or similar lodging.  The racist policies here and at the Seronera truly ruined this portion of our magical trip.  Our schoolage children  were also horrified."

The food is typical all inclusive, the drinks are served in reusable dirty tumblers. The staff only speak to the Russians. The dj threatened my daughter and caused a big row, cause she done the thumbs done sign because again it was another Russian song!  The manager did nothing! Even though staff members witnessed it. The dj called us liars, ok, what man says hes going to hit a 21 year old then goes to his possee who was a bristish woman who fancied him and tried to get them onside. Look out for the lady shell be soon in chat magazine for leaving her old man for a Turk . The life guards were that busy chatting up young girls, my daughter in law was pushed down the slide by a Russian and all they could do was give her some cotton wool! The male receptionist with glasses is the most arrogant person ever,  we paid for a room only for him to come and kick us out an hour before our time was up! Ive read another review where hes done it before. I paid good money to stay here, and Ive travelled to turkey numerous times this s the first time we have ever experienced anything like this! Read though my other reviews. If I could give a lower score I would, racist they only want our money.  The manager is a joke Seriously find another hotel, this is horrendous. Shame on you eftalia for letting turkey down. Shout out to Hanil the waiter, he was our sunshine, he should be manager! Absolutely lovely man. Fights every night always the Russians starting and they allow them to carry on drinking. Disgusting."

Firstly, the hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms are kept clean with clean bedding and towels every day.  Also, little touches like shower gel, cotton buds, shower cap, sewing kit, shoe horn etc in the room.  The maid that cleaned our room was friendly and very sweet although she did not speak much English well hardly any.  In fact, when she asked us if we were German and we replied that we were English, she shook our hands and hugged me.  More of this in a moment.If you are looking for a quiet peaceful holiday, then stay away.  When we arrived, it was in the middle of a storm and therefore all outdoor activities were a no no.  Therefore, the children's evening activities were right slap bang in the middle of reception area.  Madness, as the receptionist could not hear us or we him due to the disco music blaring out.  It was frankly a din.  We later realised that there is a meeting room and on other nights, they actually used this for the kid's entertainment when the weather was wet.  The room was ok, as I said, clean and had enough drawers and hanging space etc, but the main areas of the hotel and the lifts were tired and definitely need a refurbishment.  For instance, the lifts were shabby and the furniture in the bar area worn and needing to be replaced.  Also, lots of the chairs in the dining areas were broken and unstable.I must add here that I am not a racist  in any way, but being outnumbered by about 1,000 Germans to around 30 of us Brits, we felt very out of it.  The Germans were by and large, noisy, greedy, some quite rude and the children were so unruly running around the dining rooms and other areas knocking into people and waiters.  Carrying hot soup and food in the dining room was a bit scary with hundreds of these kids running around.  We were told by Thomas Cook that there would be few children around as it was not half term  wrong!  It was the German school holidays and there were hundreds of them there.  They were waiting for food and lining up long before breakfast dining room opening and also lunch and dinner.  We found it very difficult to get a seat at times and even turning up 10 minutes after opening, we found that our favourite deserts were all gone onto their plates.  Honestly, they piled  their plates up like there was going to be a food famine. Food, ok, but lots of chicken.  Very samey and we have had better at other hotels in Turkey previously.The whole of the area is geared for Germans.  The waiters approach you speaking German and shopkeepers around too.  They even price things in Euros.  If we had wanted to use Euros, we would have gone to Europe.  We insist on paying with Turkish Lira as we are in Turkey and love Turkey as a country and the people too.  When we did encounter another English speaking couples, we were embraced with glee as they could talk to us and understand us.  I felt the holiday was very spoiled by the noise, crowds and difficulties at meal times in the hotel.  We got out when we could and had fantastic trips as the surrounding area, especially Alanya and Manavgat are very beautiful.  If travelling by Thomas Cook, then seek out other means of excusions.  A lovely, helpful Turkish man has a little travel agents directly outside the hotel just up the  road on the right.  Does great excursions at a fraction of the price in the hotel.  You just have to go on a pirate ship for the day  food, entertainment, fun, swimming from the boat, excellent. Ours was Ali Baba boat.  The captain dresses up as a woman and is a hoot.All in all, for noisy family holidays then you might like the hotel, but be warned,even the entertainment is German.  Honestly, being English is not a good option in this hotel.  We ignored the bad reviews, but I was in tears one night as we could not find anywhere to sit in the dining room, Germans 'bagged' tables for their large party of friends and family and I almost put my food down and walked out.  Another annoying thing is that there was never enough cutlery, plates etc.  Nobody seems to keep them washed up and flowing which is not good with such a high volume of people in the hotel.  When juice machines or coffee machines ran out of coffee, milk, juice etc nobody replaced them and this happened most days.  The juice labelled was rarely the flavour you actually got and they were not real juices anyway.  If you wanted freshly squeezed orange juice, that was 1 Euro for each glass."

We stayed at this hotel from 08.08.2016 till 165.08.2016. We got a room that not worth the money..i can say it look like a two stars hotel room. The bath there was soo little that a fat person can't fit in. In the second day of our seat, we received only cold water at the shower and they  have not announced this problem I called at the reception and they said no ""sorry"" about this problem. If you don't have all inclusive, you receive water at price of 4 euro a bottle..even if you payd for lunch. They only beheave well with italian people. Every morning they bring cookies for 'colazione' but poor american breakfast for the rest  only eggs, two kinds of ham and two kinds of cheese  that's all. This hotel is too expensive for the services they offer. By the way, they don't tell you that you must pay the water...till the end. Nothing good about it. In the penultimate day they moved us in other room...and the reason for making this was a lie..they had other guests to put there from that day. It sucks!"

Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg298115d1155441r517961520ANACrownePlazaHotelKanazawaKanazawaIshikawaPrefectureHokurikuChubu.html,Date of stay: August 2017,ANA Crowne Plaza Hotel Kanazawa,Asia,Japan,Chubu,unknown,Racist CheckIn Staff Ruined My Experience,"What would have been a otherwise normal stay at the Crowne Plaza was significantly marred by how I was treated at the checkin desk. In short, I was treated like an illegal immigrant by a staff who acted in such a discriminatory manner that I was brought to the verge of tears. My initial impression is that this hotel was rather unfriendly to nonJapanese guests.Firstly, upon checkin, I was abruptly informed by the front desk that I would not be able to checkin one hour early, which was a surprise to me, as I have never had trouble as an Platinum member in checking in early. I understand that hotels have operational constraints, so I did not mind, but her mannerism towards me was rather abrupt.What I found unacceptable is what happened afterwards: the front desk lady asked to see my passport. Now, if this was the United States, I would happily hand over my ID, as every hotel does that for security reasons. However, there is no such practice of this in Japan. In Japan, hotels only ask for the guest to write down their name and address, and for nonJapanese residents, a copy of their passport number. What she did to me would be the American equivalent of demanding to know if I was a illegal immigrant or not. Frankly, what she did was extremely discriminatory, as I speak Japanese fluently as I am halfJapanese. She assumed that just because I had a nonJapanese name, that I was a foreigner, and thus subject to her looking at my passport. Words cannot describe how appalled I was at her racist behavior, especially in front of my colleague.As I found her behavior unacceptable, I asked to see her manager. She informed me that there was no manager available for the time being. Candidly, this has to be a lie  every hospitality business always has a MOD on duty. At this point, I was so appalled and saddened by her actions that I just left the hotel. My colleague, who is a journalist for an American newspaper, was simply shocked by this whole ordeal. Fortunately, upon my return to the hotel, the manager on duty Tetsushi Nishimura came and introduced himself to me. He seemed preemptively aware of the situation and apologized for the earlier misconduct of the staff. He acted in a very professional manner and I would like to commend how he handled the situation.However, words cannot describe how saddened I am by an incident like this. I specifically chose the Crowne Plaza in Kanazawa because I thought a hotel run by IHG would be to an excellent standard. I did not expect to be treated as if I was a illegal immigrant with no right to be in Japan, especially in a country that was my childhood home. What would have been a wonderful stay in Kanazawa was marred by how I was treated by the hotel, and I would not feel comfortable returning there again.Aside from my experience, other reviewers are correct in that the bathroom would look dated by American, and especially American Crowne Plaza standards. I suppose that Crowne Plazas in Japan have different standards. Furthermore, the beds that were used were rather hard, which I surmise would be uncomfortable for people who are used to Westernstyle hotel beds."

WORST. HOTEL. RACIST.,"One word: racist. Me and my friends one week holiday was nearly ruined by the staff here. The females receptionist  manager offered the worst welcome. There was mouldy 'complimentary' food left in our room when we arrived. Other things that happened were cleaners would come into room when told not to and when we were not in, our driving licenses disappeared from our rooms, they would go near our things without telling us, we were locked out of our room for nearly 2hrs cause the key and room door they gave us was faulty  they wouldn't fix it. Wifi was not free as advertised. The extra bed was a hard sofa bed, that was not sleepable. The only nice staff was one of the night security guards. The only good thing about the hotel was the scenery and look of it. Posh looking but the worst service. Everywhere else in Ayia Napa made us feel so welcome, we made many friends in our short stay in Ayia Napa, but Limanaki Beach Hotel was the worst hotel in the whole place. Other people weren't even surprised when we told them how bad they were treating us. I guess we wasn't the first and won't be the last."

Sam said I couldn't have towels because he didn't like me. Shani said I couldn't come ask for anything because she didn't like me. These people have absolutely no training and no professionalism. They are running a cess pool, not a hotel. If you want to be discriminated against and disrespected on a daily basis, by all means stay at this property. Shani is ALAWAYS stuffing her face and walking around barefoot. Sam should not be managing a hotel. He has zero problem resolution skills and has not been properly trained. He is not professional at all and he is very violent and aggressive. If I could have given this place a zero rating, I would have. Please don't go and spend your hard earned money at a place like this. Angela is very very messy and also very unprofessional. Angela is always saying your room number out loud in front of people, but she claims to have all these years of hotel experience. Whoever owns this place has a bunch of unprofessional bulies running this property, and it's going to lose them a bunch of money and clientele. I promise I'm going above and beyond to report this hotel and its employees but the right department. This place is Trash."

I think this hotel is still finding it's feet, because when they spotted our group entering the hotel, the counter clerks quickly grabbed the 'free' apples and jars of lollies off the counter to hide them away.  Small fauxpax perhaps, but when we got to the room, wanting to cool our nice German beer, we found the fridges locked !  Of many international hotels I've stayed in, I've never seen this before.  Asked at the front desk, the otherwise attractive blond German female in charge said we could pay a deposit to open the fridge  this offended me and I refused.  Asked why they lock the fridge, she said 'maybe not you caucasian, but these groups empty the minibar'.  I felt this was racist to not trust Asians and told her so, and got no satisfactory reply.Asked directions to the closest shop, the same female gave me totally misleading directions to something we eventually found 200m in a straight line away, after we walked around half the neighbourhood.Very poor advice from a local.At breakfast, with noone to greet us at the entrance, we filled plates from the buffet, and my partner found a table, sat down and started to eat.  Shortly after a waitress came over and asked her to move to another table.  Annoyed at this inconvenience resulting from their lack of service, my partner refused, and an argument ensued, ending in me shouting ""we're eating breakfast  don't p!ss us off ... !!!"" in front of about 30 various breakfast guests giving the adjacent Italian matrons great gossip material for the next 5 minutes.Recommend you don't stay at this hotel."

So this unlovely lady, Connie Bargerstock, which sadly is the hotels General Manager, is employed by Country Inn  Suites Dearborn. I highly recommend not one person or pet to this location. This lady is racist, rude, disrespectful and not worthy of her ""General Manager"" title. After having a group purchase six rooms in total she acted an a complete fool because she felt there were ""too many people in the pool"". Now, per her justification of 4 people per room there still wasn't even half that many people in the pool area. She demanded to know what room numbers and ID cards so she could verify what room types were purchased. Now I had just arrived when I walked towards the pool and she was yelling at a group of children when another mom stepped in. This is a sad woman and I pray karma bites hard."

We booked this hotel through Expedia for a NONSMOKING and 2 full beds. We got confirmation from Expedia for the booking. We reached the hotel past midnight. We went to the checkin counter and Emily was at the reception.She checked our booking and said, unfortunately, they don't have 2 Beds available but can give us King bed. We said, we have confirmed booking and business travelers. We can't just have one bed. She said please find another hotel since she can't give. I think she was racist since we were nonwhite. We tried to call Expedia and as soon as customer representative came in, Emily said she found a room and will give us a room with 2 bed. All of this took 2 hours of waiting.Once we reached the room, we learned that the room is a smoking room. We couldn't sleep. We had an important meeting in the morning and due to lack of sleep, we really had a very bad day in the morning.Just to add more salt to the injury, when Emily took our credit card for deposit, she didn't return it since we didn't notice. I had to call the bank to cancel the credit card.Really bad experience. AVOID at any cost."

Should advertise as ""WHITES ARE FAIR COMPLETION FAMILIES ONLY""","Hi All, This was a mail below that I sent to the Hotel Management and the Turkey Tourism. I received a reply from the Guest relations saying sorry but its securities duty to do so ... Please note that I have copied the Turkish Holiday Complaints, Turkish Tourism Ministry and the Turkish embassy in South Africa to this mail.Turkey is an amazing country and every time I visit beautiful Turkey I try to visit another town and city.However, this mail is not to tell you all how beautiful your country is but to complain about the most unacceptable behaviour from the staff at the Kaya Palazzo.I spent four nights at the resort which is beautiful, probably one of the best resorts I have visited in recent years however the staff made our holiday very uncomfortable and we felt like we never belonged at your resort.The staff were absolutely racist, they would never smile while talking to us or would never great us when we walked pass each other, However they would great and smile at all the other guestOn the second day, I was walking back from the pool area with my 8 year old son when the security guard approached me and started shouting at me and asked me where is my room card and where am I staying. So I asked him why, and he said he just needs to know as I am not allowed there if I was not staying there. So I asked him why did he not go and ask everyone else that was walking around me who is white and fair in complexion He said no, he needs to check mine and I said I dont have it, its with my wife. He continued harassing me for my card in front of all other guest and embarrassed both myself and son. I then just walked away.I approached the resorts guest services as there was no manager available and advised them on what had transpired and they advised they will look into it and advise me later on, when I passed guest service later that night they had apologised and said sorry as the security guy was just checking up on me. Does the security guard check up on every guest or only when the guest is not white, fair or from European CountryIt is quite obvious this was due to the colour of my skinUpon departure from Istanbul met a couple at the airport who said they will never go back to the Kaya Palazzo as their staff are very racist, they said they experienced it 2 years ago.To management of Kaya: you have a loverly resort but your staff being racist and not friendly to nonwhile guest will not take you a long way.When guest are paying you and spending, you are not questioning the colour of the money Its all the sameKaya Palazzo had dampened our holiday sprits and gave us an absolute nightmare of a feeling during our holiday which was pleasant at all.Your staff and management need to be thought that we live in a diverse world and everyone should be treated the same.When you advertise your resort, you should advertise it with a saying  WHITES ONLY. Doing this, you would not receive unwanted guest and you would not need to ruin anyones family holiday which should be a joyous occasion .I will definitely post this on TripAdvisor and Bookings.com when I am back in my office on the 1st of Nov."

Most of the positive reviews about this resort seem to be fake! To begin with, the check in to this so called 5star resort was roughly around 7 pm. The staff placed our luggage in a car and drove us to our resort since our room was further from the admin hall. Upon entering the room the floors and bathroom were filthy  both bathrooms were infested with ants and roaches The worst part was the bed. We found food fragments tucked under the sheet covers and food stains. Called management who apologized and sent two workers to clean up the room around 8 pm. Quite annoying as no guest would like to come to a hotel after a long flight and leave their room cleaned because it was done prior to checking in!  Came back and not much had been cleaned apart from the bathroom and one of our bedspreads. Had uneasy sleep that night! The fact that we paid money for housekeeping and the rooms were filthy for the 4 days that we were at the resort just went to show that this hotel is stingy and does take into consideration customer reviews  Looking back at the reviews it is evident that similar experiences were shared by other guests. The cleaners seem to do a lousy job at cleaning and generally don't start cleaning till 2 or 3 pm in the afternoon.  Another issue that arose was the OHS. The workers were cleaning the driveway in front of the customer service hall  it seems like that's the only place they know how to clean there was no sign of a wet floor. We made a booking for the shuttle bus and was heading back to our resort when I slipped on the wet path and actually hurt my back. Pathetically enough all the workers could do was laugh and just look at the situation that had unfolded before them. No apology no Sorry. Frankly, the workers here seem to be extremely racist and do not know how to treat people of colour, nationality or race. Being a large resort it is assumed that you would train your staff to have appropriate customer service and empathy when dealing with international customers. We often felt intimated by the staff and hence why stopped asking for assistance as we did not feel safe. To top of the experience upon checking out and your staff were sleeping at the counter  it was roughly around 8 am in the morning which clearly goes to show that there is no sense of professionalism or work ethic that exists in this resort. We made a complaint to Wyhdham and till this day we have not had a proper follow up regarding this terrible service. To all the customers considering this hotel don't bother. You can find better hotels that are cheaper and will go above and beyond to make you feel safe and comfortable."
