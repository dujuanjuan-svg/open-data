Yes, you get a decent overview of life under apartheid pre1994, but it is portrayed as being an incredibly dark, gloomy period as if it suddently improved after 1994 it did not, at least not markedly so for 99 of poor blacks.  You will not find a single bad word said about Mandela here.  A museum's goal is to inform, not pander to.  And an internationally acclaimed one such as the Aparthed Museum should try much, much harder in the future to lay out the pros and cons of South African history."

The organization of the exhibits can get a bit confusing, so you may have to do some backtracking, however, they offer a map at the ticketing counter to help. If you get hungry and feel yourself starting to breeze through some of the interesting parts of the museum, there is a small cafe towards the middle where you can get some food and recharge. After visiting this museum, you should have a better understanding of what Apartheid is, how it came to be, and how it came to be no more. If you want to get a souvenir, there is a small shop by the restaurant, but the selection is limited."

It is well curated with 2 ways to explore the museum, a shorter 12 hour visit or, if you have more time, a longer visit in the 24 hour timeframe. I only had 2 hours and found that it was not enough time. The museum forcefully confronts the development of racial segregation as it leads to what became Apartheid. The history of the English and Dutch settlers, and how they interacted with and ultimately dominated the native tribes, is explored in frank and moving ways.  The museum also covers the student uprising starting in 1976, the reconciliation period starting in 1990 which led to Mandelas release and the ultimately the new Constitution and elections that ended the Apartheid era.  I would suggest spending some time in the room with the film of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which shows a critical piece of the process of how the country moved peacefully away from the Apartheid era.  The film is about 40 minutes but you I would suggest spending at least 1015 watching the Commission process.  This was a fascinating museum addressing a painful period and horrible policy of racial interaction in South Africa."

As one enters one is arbitrarily assigned a racial classification. There were official classifications back in the bad days of apartheid based on such improbable things as the colour of fingernails, width of nostrils and whether pencils would fall out of kinked hair. The card evokes strange feelings in me. Apartheid classified and divided people.Outside the museum a group of school children shriek noisily. Their visit to this museum is a peep inside a world they have never known and probably cant imagine. Inside one faces a world most South Africans, black and white, who were old enough to have experienced would rather forget. This museum is an exercise in wrestling with the past.The exhibits are somewhat on the academic side, and if one is inclined to move quickly through a museum, stopping only for when something particularly grabs ones attention, then one will probably get through this is somewhat less than the recommended twoandahalf hours. Like most South African museums, the Apartheid Museum nearly always has a beautifully researched temporary exhibition. Until August 2008 the temporary exhibition at the Apartheid Museum focuses on Steve Biko and his place in the history of the country of his birth. The exhibition traces this from the establishment of the African intellectual tradition, through the move to Africanism, Pan Africanism, Black Consciousness, the student movements and official resistance and oppression. The exhibition has some very poignant moments. The medical evidence and the findings of the South African Medical and Dental Council which finally struck Dr Tucker off the role are shocking, even to people who remember the newspaper account. The comments of Minister Jimmy Kruger on the death of Biko are horrifying. The tributes to Biko by various public figures in widely diverse spheres are very moving. But it is the fact that South Africa was not alone in its growing awareness of the need to recognise the human rights of black people which impresses me most."

A museum that depicts, in a modern way, the horror made by man, by people that justified the political system by referring to God. People that thereby found legitimacy in opression by legislating racial segregation and thus constitutionally deny black, colored, and Asians all the human rights and liberties we, the people of the western world, enjoyed for so long. If you re not a great fan of museums in general, I say, this museum is not like any other museum I have ever visited. Do not miss the opportunity to see, feel, and learn about the cruelty of mankind when evil oppresses goodness in the name of God. The museum is combining modernity with the history of apartheid in a well structured and great storytelling way. One part is dedicated to Nelson Mandela, and the other to the Apartheid; how it was constructed and how it worked and what it meant to the people of South Africa. It depicts the struggle of resistens, the grand finale when it eventually broke down. You learn about the call for forgiveness in the truth and reconcelliation commission, and a lot more. Having said all this, it is really a shame that people still suffer as they do. They have a long way to go, still."

The place tells the story of the rise and fall of that horror called apartheid which separated whites from other racial groups and in the process oppressed people of other races in South Africa. The museum tells the story mainly through pictures and words with supporting videos and artifacts. It takes a fair amount of attention to follow the many complexities involved. I kept thinking I was missing important elements as it was sometimes difficult to follow the signage from location to location. That was aggravated by a special exhibit on Nelson Mandela located near the entrance that seemed to be organized topically rather than chronologically. That made it hard to follow. We literally kept losing our way through the museum and through the unfolding events of the story. Unfortunately, the challenge of physically navigating through the museum took us out of the experience. While still a mustsee, I think the layout reduced the impact of bearing witness to one of the most compelling stories of triumph over oppression in any era. "

The Apartheid Museum documents the struggle for freedom during the period of racial oppression in South Africa.The National Party came to power in 1948 in a surprise election victory. There were many reasons why it triumphed, but one of the major reasons for it was that it offered segregation of the races in simple, easytograsp terms.This was taken to such a height that the South African Bureau for Racial Affairs was launched. This led directly to a number of racial laws, including the Population Registration Act, which assigned every person to a racial category; and the Group Areas Act, which enforced separate urban areas for each race group.There were countless other repressive measures. It was a crime to strike and freedom of movement was severely curtailed. 'It was a crime to walk through a whitesonly door,' wrote Nelson Mandela, 'a crime to live in a certain area and a crime to have no place to live'.Apartheid led to growing resistance, which brought greater oppression and a reign of terror by the security establishment. It is this struggle for freedom that is the focus of the Apartheid Museum at Gold Reef City in Johannesburg.Set on 21 acres of land, superbly landscaped grounds, this historical museum has 22 exhibition areas designed by a team of curators, filmmakers and historians.

While that facility takes a broader view of racial issues at the time, this site is much more specific and focuses on the goings on at the Little Rock Central High School.

When Little Rock's white high school Central High was integrated in 1957, the governor of the state, Orval Faubus, called in the Arkansas National Guard to help block integration, precipitating a crisis which required the U.S. president, Dwight Eisenhower, to call in federal troops to protect the Little Rock Nine, the nine AfricanAmerican students integrating the school.This small museum commemorates the 1957 events, and does so splendidly. It's an easily toured museum because of its small size, but the rich resources it contains are outstanding. Through a multimedia approach involving wall displays, video screens with sound, computers, etc., the museum walks visitors through the history of racial turmoil and oppression of people of color in the state, leading up to the Central High crisis. An added plus is a gift shopcum book shop with a nice array of books about the history of race relations in the American South and Arkansas in particular, and about the Central High crisis and the Civil Rights movement. The museum frequently also displays local art by AfricanAmerican artists  a mustnotmiss feature of the museum.My one criticism: though the displays in the museum link the struggle of African Americans for rights to the struggle of women, laborers, the poor, various ethnic groups for rights, I have never seen any mention at all of the struggle of LGBT citizens of the U.S. for rights in this museum's display.In a city and state with an undistinguished record regarding LGBT rights, this is a major lacuna  especially when important Civil Rights leaders from Coretta Scott King to James Baldwin, Bayard Rustin, John Lewis, Julian Bond, Mildred Jeter Loving and many others have emphasized that the struggle of African Americans for rights is linked to the struggle of LGBT people for rights."

I was going to take the course through PADI in Cedar Rapids. However, since I live in Iowa City and DiVentures is closer to me, I chose DiVentures. It turned out to be a biggest mistake. Heres my experience. 1The store operation was very disorganized. No one ever picked up phone calls, forcing me to drive there to get my questions answered. What ridiculous was that different staff gave me different answers for the same questions. One staff told another student the open water dive check began at 8 am in Cedar Fall, whereas it started at 9 am. My impression was that those staff had never been properly trained. In addition, no one ever informed me the schedule of classes and open water dive check. Only until the minute that the class started, I knew the schedule, interrupting all my own plan. The store only gave out the schedule at the last minute. Even worse, the store failed to follow its own lastminute schedule. The swimming pool reserved for the course was not open as scheduled. It asked us to meet at the swimming pool at 8 am on Sunday, had us wait outside of the swimming pool for 2 hours, and then told us it couldnt find any personnel to open the swimming pool. The whole Sunday was ruined.  I paid 500 and imagined getting a decent training, but solely get crappy experience.  2It closed the store early without any notification, so I couldnt return the rental gear when I arrived the store. After my open water dive check on Sunday, the instructor who is also the store manager refused to open the store and take the rental gear back in the same day. Therefore, I returned the gear next day at my earliest time possible. When I arrived the store, a note was posted on the door saying that the store had to close early due to staff illness. The open water dive check instructor/store manager knew that we are going to return gear that day. However, she didnt email/message us the early closure of the store. I complained the early closure without notification to the CEO of the company. He said to me, is it you first time to encounter a store closed early No wonder the whole store was disorganized. If the tone at the top is to deny the wrongdoing, its not surprising that the store doesnt have any standard.  3Whats worse. Its instructors made racial comments/jokes. In the incidence that no personnel opened the swimming pool for the class, the instructor shouted out loudly, its more acceptable when white people screwed up. I complained it to the CEO. He thought I just made up stories. If you are a people with color, think twice before you choose DiVentures. Moreover, from its own staff, I learned that the retail price of DiVentures scuba gear is twice of the manufacturing cost. If youre economical, think twice before making purchase from DiVentures. Check out cheaper equipment online. There are plenty available online. The class and open water dive check were so simple, and the depth was around 10 or 15 feet. You dont need expensive equipment for it. If you plan to dive in ocean, there are plenty local dive centers to rent you a full set of equipment. Plus, scuba fin is too big to fit in a baggage. Also, ask around the dive level before you choose DiVentures. I learned it the hard way. After I received my scuba diving certificate from DiVentures, my friend who earned a certificate from PADI compared our certificate. Although both of us are certified for Level 1, mine allows to dive only up to 60 feet, but hers would allow up to 100 feet. It must be that DiVentures split the Level 1 course in PADI into 2 different courses, so it could charge students another couple of hundred bucks. In sum, if you are new to scuba and want to have a pleasure training experience, stay away from DiVentures. Its disorganized operation, horrible leadership and racial discriminated instructors will ruin your scuba experience."

We recently went for a oneweek ski vacation, renting a lovely chalet Unterberg 153 with my wife, children and their young families.  The people were generally nice and the skiing was good, until we run into the gondola police.  On the third day of our vacation, our two sons decided to stay back and take care of the babies instead of skiing.  So my wife and one of our daughtersinlaw borrowed their ski passes to go up the mountain to enjoy the view.  Little did we know that this was not allowed in Austrian ski resorts. We later found out that there is a sign in German informing the public that ski passes are not exchangeable, but nothing in English to warn foreign tourists.  So when my darkskin wife and our blond daughterinlaw went to take the gondola up to the mountain, one of them was controlled and fined 50 Euros.  What was most upsettingin addition to being punished for not understanding Germanwas that the supposedly random check left the blond passenger alone and focused on the darkskin person.  So here is my advice to you based on this unpleasant racial profiling experience: Grossarl is a nice ski destination if you speak German, but if you dont you may want to think twice about going there, especially if your skin color designates you as a foreigner!"

That stance is unfortunate because she took great liberty  on her choice of content and we had a tour with minimal facts about the building, its pathbreaking impact or how the architecture displayed Jefferson's concept of higher education.  We got quite a bitand it was valuableon the role of enslaved staff and how they were treated. However, she used Pavillions I and III and the racial prejudices of two of the first faculty members as illustration without any attempt to mention anything positive about them or other personnages of that period. Then we heard a lot about student protests of the '60's and '70's and more recently, involving politics Vietnam and racial inequities based on the experience of a personal friend of hers. These are valid topics, certainly, but we were there to learn about the Rotunda, newly reopened after a long restoration, not politics. She covered Jefferson's involvement with Sally Hemings, an enslaved servant at Monticello, framing it as a scientically proven fact that he had fathered several children with her after his own wife had died, adding that the relationship was nonconsensualperhaps true but certainly not yet accepted fact. In any event, Jefferson's sexual proclivities had no place on a Rotunda tour;  we can go learn about that at Monticello. The University should at least require the guides to stay within a certain range of topics or alert potential visitors that topics covered may vary."

I believe all prospective customers should know how this casino condones racial discrimination before affording them the opportunity of your time and money. The CSM did contact me the day after the incident, however, no future action was taken. Hence, I emailed the director of HR on December 28 and still yet, no follow up. Hence, this casino has absolutely no respect for their customers and allows racial discrimination to occur.""My experience tonight has been such an eye opener and has motivated me to begin creating some changes for the upcoming year.Tonight, my family and I decided to go to Table Mountain for a fun outing. Upon arriving to the casino my cousin's and I decided to ask a server for a complimentary drink. After, the server allowed us to get a drink I noticed a hair in my cup. I politely told her there was a hair in the drink and she rudely responded, ""Well throw it away."" I then asked her can I have another one and she replied no and walked away. I followed her and asked her once again, nicely, ""May I have another drink."" She still persistently replied no. Then, I asked to speak to her manager and she responded, ""No you may not, but I'll take you to security."" I said no I'd like to speak to a manager. Seeing as a officer was right there she told him I was harassing her. The officer was very professional when I stated what happened and allowed me to speak with her supervisor. The supervisor informed me that it would be handled and offered me another drink.Moments later, a man walked up to my cousin's and I and asked to see ID Identification. We showed it to him and then he told us that he'll need them to run a check on it, we hesitantly agreed. Confused at what the ID was needed for since it was checked at the gate, he said that the server claimed we were harrasing her. We restated the same story. When speaking to him and restating the story he had such a biased facial epxression. Reluctantly, he let it go.Later into the night, another server came by and we asked for a water. She served everyone else around us expect us. So we decided to ask one more time. She rudely said, ""Wait."" And after she handed us water she went to speak to the officer behind a machine and asked him why haven't they kicked us out yet and that she wants to file a complaint on us. She then went to speak with the biased ""manager"" and told him ""her story."" As we clearly saw what was going on we decided to talk to him ONCE AGAIN. He was rude when telling us we need to, ""Be quiet and listen to him."" He stated that the 2nd server said that I knocked over her cart and took a water."" Extremely puzzled, I said that never happened I sat in the same seat, her cart was still in tack with all its items when she came over to speak with you. My family members once again defended me because they were EYE WITNESSES. The manager said he's been watching the survielence and I told him well if he was he would have seen that I never knocked her cart down. Then he told my family members and I we have to leave the premises immediately. I've never felt so discriminated against. How is it that I was attacked from the very first interaction. No matter how educated you are or well spoken you may be, it doesn't matter. Your voice, your concern means nothing because of the color of your skin."""

The main reason for going there was to educate my grandson for a school project on Martin Luther King.I was fascinated by the exhibition depicting the lives, struggles, hopes and ideals of three great person in different parts of the world fighting against racial discrimination and social injustices meted out to their people.  The exhibits display the injustices suffered by the people, their hopes and their struggles to overcome them.Gandhi  This display section shows how Gandhi got involved against injustice suffered by coloureds including Indians in South Africa and later in India against the British colonialists who meted out unfair and unjust treatment to his countrymen.  The display include two of his possessions, his bicycle and the spinning wheel which he used to weave his own clothes.  The exhibition highlights his nonviolent movement, Satyagraha to achieve independence for India.  His life ended at the hands of an extremist.King  Black citizens in USA were not treated equal to whites.  White people had their own schools, shops, parks etc where black people were banned.  The exhibition shows various events and Kings fights against these injustices committed against his people.  The exhibition also displays a film about his life and resistance together with a display depicting his famous speech I have a dream.  His vision was to see black and white children attending the same schools and playing together.Mandela  fought against the apartheid regime in South Africa where blacks had no say whatsoever.  Blacks could not live in white areas, seating in buses were segregated as well as in the churches.  Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years at Reuben Island and was forced to work in a quarry.  His greatness lies in his vision and achievement of racial harmony between black and white people.  After he became the President of South Africa, by his actions he won the hearts of many white people.  His true achievement is the present South Africa considered a rainbow nation where all persons of every race has equal opportunities.This exhibition was an eye opener for me and a great learning and thinking experience!   In addition to the exhibition do not forget to enjoy this ancient church with its majestic interior."

One such place is the former Carver Theatre, a twostory, stucco faade brick building located on Harden Street across from historically black Allen University. Built around 1941, the Carver Theatre was one of two exclusively black theaters in Columbia that showed movies and hosted weekly talent shows during the racial segregation era. The other black theater, the Capitol, has been demolished.The Carver continued to operate as a movie theater until 1971. Though its been commercially repurposed with a first floor renovation, the National Registerlisted structure still sports its distinctive vertical marquee and has many original features inside, including a slanting floor, a lobby with ticket booth, and a balcony with the original seating and lighting. When I saw the exterior of the structure yesterday it was easy to see that it was a theater in its former life.  There is a historical marker in front of the building"

It's very disorganized. No one ever picked up phone calls. Those staff had never been properly trained. Different staff gave me different answers for the same questions.  In addition, the store only gave out the schedule at the last minute. Even worse, the store failed to follow its own lastminute schedule. The swimming pool reserved for the course was not open as scheduled. It asked us to meet at the swimming pool at 8 am on Sunday, had us wait outside of the swimming pool for 2 hours, and then told us it couldnt find any personnel to open the swimming pool. Even worse, its instructors made racial comments/jokes. In the incidence that no personnel opened the swimming pool for the class, the instructor shouted out loudly, its more acceptable when white people screwed up. I complained it to the CEO. He thought I just made up stories. If you are a people with color, think twice before you choose DiVentures."

The house we toured was very close walking distance from Mark Twains house, but his house was 90 filled with his original belongings; hers was not.  My husband and I felt like the guide we had was our teacher and we were in school to be taught about race relations.  Yes, Uncle Toms Cabin was an important work by Stowe back before the Civil War, and it was interesting to see what led to her wanting or feeling compelled to write it, but from the moment we walked in to the Visitors Center to the moment we left her house, we felt like we were being judged on hw we could relate this novel to todays racial climate, including what novels we had read that were socially important somehow.  The house had a homier feel than Twains but it was smaller and had been recently refurbished to feel like someone was living in it today.  It just felt less about Harriet and more like a civics lesson to us."

I had to leave him because he was not only insulting he was unbelievably rude. I cannot believe that such racial preferencing continues to run rampant in Dubai. Celebrated by organizers that deem it okay for caucasians to dress however they want but for anyone darker than olive its unacceptable.

We are writing an urgent complaint regarding the 2 tours we took with GLT tours in Rome from 15th July 2018  Rome by Night and 16th July  Tivoli. Here are the highlights Paid for ONLY English means only English not English and SpanishWe had paid for an exclusive English speaking tour for 'Rome by Night' 'Tivoli with Adriana Villa'.On both the occasions, we had company of mixed Spanish and English speaking guides with majority emphasis given on Spanish words. If we exclusively have paid for English ONLY, then you cannot provide another substitute without prior knowledge for the same price. This is absolute wrong and termed as cheating.Rome by Night Tour was hopeless. The guide kept laughing at her own jokes and for no reason. We began to think she was drunk or too ignorant.The guide was very unclear when speaking English and was more loud and clear for Spanish making the English experience a disaster.The tour was mostly in Spanish and some of that was translated to English in blurry sentences.She could not pronounce the English words and had very little to talk about the history of Rome, its culture or any of her extended knowledge during the tour. It was mostly laughing her at own silly jokes which made the experience awkward and a disaster for us all as majority were English speaking tourists.Miss/Mrs. Samatha MacinatiWe are writing to urge you to remove/withdraw Miss/Mrs. Samatha Macinati from her existing or freelance contract job role of 'Tour Guide' GLT before further action is required to be taken by us.On 16th July, we took an exclusive English Speaking tour with her.Total of 64 assuming tourists were on board with 58/59 English and 5/6 Spanish.She began speaking more seconds per min for Spanish translation in the bus, and I understand that English words take longer to translate and even then her Spanish felt longer by the second. Other guests will agree with us. She skipped saying few important details about Tivoli in English which she mentioned in Spanish, and which other fellow tourists told us about later.We asked her to speak more elaborately in English upon arriving to Tivoli and she rudely answered that 'I am speaking in both'. She refused to even look at my father and me.This was clearly a racial behaviour. Here sudden favouritism to 6 Spanish tourists was beyond embarrassment for asking a simple request question to a tour guide. She was so blunt and rude and kept laughing at us, who were then the only Indian family with her on board.We believe she was thinking racially that we do not seem to understand her English which for your kind information was as hopeless as her attitude to Indian tourists and we disapprove of this behaviour. I have few other American witnesses, who were angry with her on the tour and are thoroughly disappointed with her rude, arrogant and overconfident attitude of a tour guide. Upon reaching Tivoli, she started purposely speaking more in Spanish and when she asked us all, 'how many Spanish people are here around', hardly few any hands were raised in the crowd.I pointed out, that 'this is what we mean', she arrogantly replied 'So what, they also paid for this too' and yelling at me instead, that 'Don't you know Spanish"" to me  a tourist. I have witnesses who can confirm this behaviour.Her over friendly mode towards the 6 strangers was getting annoying to all other fellow tourists as she was only talking in Spanish during break time and we had common voice head phones attached to all our ears so we could only listen to Spanish and not even talk between ourselves during the common head phone tour.If we talk about payment assuming 64 guests, we English chosen tourists being majority, would hold 90 of your profit on 16th July. And yet, she chose to ignore us, 90 tourist request and kept mingling beyond limits required from a tour guide with the other 6 Spanish chosen tourists. We thought they were her family.My father started telling her to understand her customers requirements and pointing out that she was doing the wrong thing. So she immediately changed to being rude and arrogant with him. She demonstrated obvious raciest behaviour  thinking that 'this Indian old man does not understand any English'. So she raised her hands in strongly disapproving motion to my father in front of everyone, when he was talking, and moved her head to the other side. Her behaviour startled and astonished my elderly father and all other people. I thought she was about to slap him. Her behaviour was uncalled for and very raciest.Miss/Mrs. Samantha Macinati, has no basic manners for customers, guests or elders. She is not fit to work for this job with tourists.She is highly raciest with her conclusion about my father and was inappropriately favouring the other 6 Spanish chosen language tourists during the entire 6/8 hours of the Tivoli tour.We have many witnesses who spoke to me and my family to share their disappointment about Miss/Mrs. Samantha Macinati and her arrogant attitude towards us.Upon reaching Rome, we and more tourists with us, went to speak with the reception staff at Green Line tours office who was very poor in supporting our complaint and instead telling us to leave. This was horrible experience at your office and we will inform all friends to never take the tour with you. To avoid further public embarrassment and rascal complaints on social media, I strongly suggest that you remove Samantha Macinati, from the position of GLT guide. She is not worthy of this position and is therefore creating a bad experience for all tourists. She is destroying the name of your business in Italy and worldwide. I have told this to everyone in my global contacts and they will also be spreading the news about Miss/Mrs. Samantha Macinati 'favouritism to Spanish and racism to Indian' behaviour and her links with Green Line tours. I request you to take this matter as top priority and take action as required. Your company's image and customer satisfaction is being misshandled by this employee. She has not only demonstrated racial behaviour towards my father in front of 64 international tourists but she has humiliated us for asking her to speak more in English and was very rude, obnoxious and arrogant with her biased favouritism to the only 6 Spanish tourists on board. Other guests were equally  disappointed and angry with her attitude. Such are not called 'tour guides'.Pleas contact me to speak about this in more detail.Saloni Sonawala44 744 754 9441UK"

We got to visit the debate rooms also which was a bonus. The only issue I observed and felt very offended was when I was searched by the security guard whilst my family and other visitors who came in at the same time were not. Its racial discrimination as I am mixed black well black in their eyes while my family who were with me are Caribbean Indians. Also their were seemingly Scottish older visitors also who all were not searched by the security guard after going through the scanner. They cant claim that I had anything unlawful on me as the guard who allowed me to pass through the scanner said I always ok to go on yet the other security guard chose to search me ALONE amongst almost ten other visitors who came in just after including my family members. Racial discrimination will accomplish nothing in this land if people are so naive, and racist. Sorry but no sorry, it was very apparent. It seems some of these people still have a long way to go.

We gathered, in a circle, at the lodge to gear up and we're told we need not touch the gears coz they will fix them for us.  TWO staff started fixing the gears after telling us to put our feet into the loops of the rope device. The after a while 5 to 7min or so the other 6 people were all fixed and even helmet and gloves chosen, and the my partner and I were totally ignored. At one point we started pulling the buckles of the gears but a staff immediately told me to stop, he'd take care of it. He and the other staff NEVER did. We were left in this weird group unequipped standing there like idiots, so I sat down in a rage. After a few seconds the 3rd staff jumped in to help us.There was no excuse whatsoever for singling us out, were there A staff handled 2 visitors, then went on to the next 2, and all were geared up and happy. The other staff sticked to the 2 visitors he started with, never cared to continue on us EVEN he noticed we were upprep for by telling me to stop tightening the buckles.We flew 21horus on the plane just to get here and with all respect and appreciation for the New England leaves in fall and USA people.  I thought the racial thing is over esp in a popular tourist attraction, and yet here we are again. We had done nothing wrong to piss anyone off and yet we have been treated so unfairly. I do hope that your staff will appreciate the fact that we came into the place excited for the zip experience because of the good reviews you have worked hard to build and on the assumption that we are no different from any other human being."

They also allow you to take your own cold food and drink in. Hot food isnt allowed as 1 it tends to stink and 2 people may wipe their greasy hands on the seats. So think thats fair enough. Never had an issue here, staff are friendly and the previous comment about someone saying they were racially abused because there were no seats left in the film. Never heard anything so ridiculous....Your skin colour has nothing to do with this. No seats left means no seats left. Simple.

The store is full of native artworks, crafts, stone sculptures, jewelry, music, etc. However, following my visit in August 2018, this store has lost my patronage. My friends and I walked in looking to purchase a few specific items but the staff was completely disinterested in helping us. My friend asked for help and was abruptly cut off in mid sentence by a salesman who told her that he didnt have time at the moment to wait on her. And then we watched while he continued to schmooze another customer who was looking to buy big ticket jewelry items. As we waited for service, we proceeded to quietly browse around the shop until a younger sales lady snapped at another one of my friends; accusing her of taking photos of the stone carvings in one of their display cases which she was NOT doing at all... she was texting someone. There are signs everywhere telling customers not to take photos of the artwork they sell. They claim the reason is to protect the artists. As a side note, I fail to see how this policy protects anyone. Both the store and the individual artists who sell their works there are missing out on tons of free publicity and advertising by not allowing people to take photos of the artworks and share them. Also, if an instore customer knows someone who wants to buy a piece but they arent allowed to take photos, the store is losing out on a potential sale. Anyway, after this rude sales lady wrongly jumped all over my friend, an older man came out of nowhere and started to stalk our group around the store like we were shoplifting or something!! I finally said to hell with this place and we all walked out without purchasing anything. Later, we came to the conclusion that our poor treatment by the staff had been a case of racial profiling. 3 of the 4 of us are native and all of the staff we interacted with were white. And this store sells Native American ephemera. How ironic is that! And this whole episode bothered me enough that 4 months later, Im still thinking about it. Anyway, please dont spend your money here. This store puts dollars ahead of customer service and clearly has no respect or consideration for indigenous peoples."

My girlfriend and I walked in on our last night in Barcelona expecting a great experience after checking the reviews. The two young ladies at the front checked our IDs and then looked me up and down. One of the ladies then asked us to wait while she checked if I could get in with my Adidas flip flops on. She picks up a phone and then speaks to someone for about 23 minutes in Catalan while the other gave me multiple dirty looks. After the call the young lady states that I need closed shoes to enter and that beachwear was not permitted. I was fine with that, until. My girlfriend and I stepped back out and contemplated me going back to our room to change shoes. Before we could even come to a decision we witnessed 3 males in the span of 5 minutes walk in with walmart style thong flip flops, show their ID and be granted access to the casino. They were not required to have closed shoes as their beachwear was acceptable. These men were Caucasians. No calls were made. Now I have to say that I don't know if this was racially or nationally motivated but it didn't sit well. It put a slight damper on the evening but it wasn't ruined completely. Was this call made because we were black, Americans or a combination of the 2 We will never know now. All because of my flip flops"

Really the only places we got to learn any was in the First African Baptist Church and here.  While the museum certainly presents the negative aspects of race relations in Savannah Jim Crow, the KKK, overt discrimination, that was not the overall takeaway.  I walked away inspired by the people who made the nonviolent movement work in the city.  I learned about the sitins, boycotts and the movement to integrate Tybee Beach, none of which I had heard of before.  The more well known civil rights leaders including Hosea Williams and MLK came to Savannah; however, I thought this museum did a great job of highlighting the lesser known heroes of the city's fight for equality.  While I understand that the racial history of the city may be uncomfortable for many Savannah natives, it really seems that they have something to be proud of herea successful nonviolent movement that aided the progress toward racial equality in this country.  These heroes should be celebrated, not relegated to a museum featured on the ""Savannah Off the Beaten Path"" list.  The museum does not seek to blame or shame white Americans in fact, there is a whole panel dedicated specifically to white Americans who assisted in the movement.  Instead, it seeks to educate and celebrate this important part of the city's history.After going through the museum, we spoke with Troy Lance, who was an attentive and helpful tour guide throughout our visit.  We learned about the struggle to get this museum on the Dot route, on the mainstream tourism maps, and on the list of recommended museums by the Visitor Center which is only a few blocks away.  While the museum is not ""flashy"" and does require a lot of reading from panels, that shouldn't stop you from coming.

While primarily focusing on Charlotte itself, it also touches on achievements and problems of the South in general. Being from the North, I found the information presented to be very educational and interesting.The museum's primary exhibit, ""Cotton Fields to Skyscrapers,"" starts in the mid 1800's during the cotton era and ends with modernday Charlotte. The exhibit does a great job educating the public about the financial and racial struggles the South has faced in it's past, while also pointing out it's enormous growth and success. Visitors really get a good understanding of how difficult it must have been to be a cotton farmer in the South, especially as a tenant farmer or sharecropper. The men and women of the past had to work so hard just to provide basic necessities like food and clothes for their families. It definitely makes you realize how fortunate we are today.The museum also does a good job at covering the Civil Rights Era and the boom of the Banking Industry in Charlotte that helped contribute to it's population explosion. The museum also has a few other exhibits upstairs that you can check out, but they are rotating exhibits and weren't quite as interesting as the primary exhibit downstairs.I visited the museum on a Sunday and admission was free. I believe admission is normally 8 for adults. While I wouldn't want to pay much more than 8 to visit, I would still pay that much. Plus, they do validate your parking for 2 hours if you park in the Seventh Street Station Parking Garage."

The museum chronicles some of the history of the indigenous communities in Chiapas, including a very fascinating piece on the Spaniards' obsession with racial mixtures.  We heard from several people that the museum is not included on organized tours because of some business owners' opposition to the positions that Don Samuel took during his years of service, and also because the museum has a policy of not giving tour operators a cut for bringing tourists there.

Only to find out that your policies are a lie.2 When I asked him how long it would take for the next bus he said  it could be in an hour, I dont know. Ill try to put you on the next bus. What is that supposed to mean, to try and put a paying customer, so if again I am unable to get into the queue first then I wont get on the bus3 When I was waiting at the door of the bus, both the driver and supervisor present, looked at me, and then the bus driver told the supervisor I only have 4 seats remaining, two of which were for a couple whose children were already on the bus. This meant that there are now two seats left. But to my surprise, I was told that I cant board, just because two girls who havent yet paid for their ticket were standing behind me, and have been waiting4 I think you should train your supervisors better, and to actually educate them on your companys policies regarding travel, and how to deal with customer complaints.5 when I got frustrated that I had to removed my bags because your supervisor didnt let me board the bus, I wasnt going to wait for the next bus.

Nothing prepared us for what is shown here, the ignorance and brutality of the white supremacists, and how they denied a whole people  their rights to live as human beings.This exhibition should be made compulsory to all those who believe that racial intolerance and segregation can ever be justified, it may open a few eyes.What comes shining though here, is the quiet dignity of those protesters who forced the South to change, and how their nonviolent actions showed the bigots in authority for what they were.Well done Jackson for building this place of learning and for facing up to the events of the past.The sad fact is that some people cannot accept that the world has changed for the better, so there has to be airport kind of security at the Museum entrance.The building has a small restaurant which is reasonably priced.

To those that will read this review, there are two separate museum collections that are connected by the main foyer to the other. The Museum of Mississippi History as other reviewers have stated, displays artifacts, narrated videos, and features famous Mississippians from 13,000 BC until the present. The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum displays artifacts, prolific speeches, narrated videos, and film footage of AfricanAmerican life from slavery to the present. There are a total of eight galleries in this museum and it has interactive stations like the quality of a Smithsonian museum where you can listen to audio recordings of interviews and speeches of those who fought for racial equality in Mississippi. You will see the love and the hate that came with the fight for equality in this museum. The museum rivals other civil rights museums across the Southeast that I have visited.There was so much to see and read about some of the history of Mississippi and the Civil Rights Era that I, an educated person and native, wasn't aware of. My heart rejoiced and my soul was stirred. Some of the exhibit was emotional for me at times,  but it was well worth the emotion to continue to learn about the past and how it has impacted the present. The museum gift shop was stocked with tshirts, coffee mugs, magnets, cookbooks, cheese straws, pencils, and other trinkets that were decent souvenirs. There is a small restaurant in the museum that sells sandwiches and other baked goods, but I didn't eat there. Perhaps on another visit when it isn't as crowded.Plan four hours to visit the museum of you tour both museums and take a break for lunch. My suggestion is to go during the week as early as the museum opens. I went two days after Christmas with my family and it was packed with families and visitors that I met, as far away as Washington state. I doubt if the newness wears off anytime soon, so anticipate a large crowd with school field trips, family reunions, etc."

The planes, parachutes, deconstructed engines, and other devices offer a great window into the technology of the time. The displays do an excellent job of explaining the world of racial segregation and disenfranchisement that was prevalent at the time.

While you are visiting the college, be sure to visit the arts and crafts studios in town, the Kentucky crafts center, and enjoy the beautiful gardens maintained by the college.  Berea is a very attractive choice for a college education, but it's not easy to get in to.  It is ranked as the most selective college in Kentucky, accepting only 17 of its applicants and among the top 50 liberal arts colleges.

The focus is on young people from the rural areas of Appalachia 70, but the college also has students from 46 states and 20 of its student body is AfricanAmerican.  But there's more: Berea college has a labor requirement min. 10hrs./week for all of its students, whether it's in the workshops producing quality artisanal arts  crafts, or the wait or hotel staff of the collegeowned Boone Hotel and Restaurant, or any number of other tasks the students might be asked to perform.  And Berea has held to its motto ""God has made of one blood all the peoples of the earth"" for nearly 120 years.  Imagine a college that chose to respect the principle of racially integrated education in late 19th century Kentuckytwo of the college's chapels were burnt to the groundand the college was finally forced to deny education to its Black students in 1908 by a law passed by the Kentucky state legislature, enforcing the educational segregation that was the norm in the South.  As soon as it could do so legally following the Brown vs. Board of Education ruling by the US Supreme Court in 1954, Berea reintegrated its student body.  This college is a truly inspirational institution, a real gem that we can all be proud of, and it's a spiritually uplifting experience to take the studentguided tour."

Haunting. Gutwrenching.,"Exploring the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC was one of the most emotionallydraining tours I've been on. You hear of the Holocaust as a young kid, but the experience is elevated to a whole new different level when you get to see artifacts of one of the most horrific times in the history of the world with your own eyes.It was offseason when I visited no entrance fee, so the line to get in was not long. Security was tight; they'll check your bags before you get in. Then you'll head to the elevators, where you will be given a booklet detailing the story of one Holocaust victim. You are encouraged to think of this victim during the tour. You can easily spend four hours in the museum. It is huge. And masterfully designed. I think the crowds could detract from your experience. Avoid peak seasons. Come early in the morning if possible.The Holocaust Museum is filled with a mix of actual artifacts and replicas from a grim period. Shoes of innocent victims. Hats. Wedding rings. It shows tons of pictures of thin workers, cramped in tiny bunk beds. Dioramas of the gas chambers. Movie clips of the killings and burials. It is thoughtprovoking. It makes you think about the twisted ideology of racial supremacy. It makes you think about the innocent victims fighting for their lives, struggling to thrive in an environment where death is in the foreseeable future.One thing that should be pointed out is that the Nazis targeted hundreds of thousands of other groups, aside from the Jews. Jews became their main target, but they also singled out various groups for persecution because they were either ""enemies of the state"" or they were sources of social, racial, or biological ""degeneration."" Communists, trade unionists, liberals, and pacifists were arrested for their political views. Dissenting clergy faced imprisonment if they spoke out against the regime. Jehovah's Witnesses were persecuted for their refusal to swear allegiance to the state. Homosexuals were targeted because of their sexual orientation. Gypsies, Czechs, Poles, and Slavic people from the Soviet Union were stigmatized as racially ""inferior."" Mentally and physically disabled people were regarded as ""lives unworthy of life."" What kind of twisted thinking is that!And the sad part is that persecution still exists today. People are discriminated based on race, religion, sexual orientation, mental health, etc. The Holocaust Museum made me emotional. Furious. But it also reminded me that although we have moved forward and have gone a long way, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. I need to be more vigilant. To speak out when needed. And to be the voice for people who haven't found their voice.Powerful. Haunting. Gutwrenching.The U.S. Holocaust Museum needs to be on your bucket list. Take a break from your fastpaced life and visit this museum. You will come out with a renewed vigor for life."

But, this is much more than an emotional journey into one of modern history's most inhuman moments.  It is a jarring reminder of of the banality of evil and the persistence of hateful prejudice that  unfortunately  seems to have no trouble justifying even the most horrifying exercises in persecution.The museum's exhibits are truly stunning from the photos to the documentary presentations right down to the sense of foreboding and the realization, perhaps the most important revelation of the museum, that these horrific acts were carried by human beings just like us!  While in one sense the direct perpetrators of the Holocaust were surely among the world's most heinous evildoers, the more striking recognition may be to ask the question: ""How could the Holocaust have happened""  And then to recognize that the answer lies not in the manic presence of Hitler as a political leader, or in the mass hysteria that gave rise to the Nazi party, but in the passive acceptance of an absurd and surpassingly ugly set of beliefs that allowed a political movement to invest in emotional scapegoating, to justify mob violence and, in the end, quietly crept its way to the unimaginable  genocide.There is no more powerful museum in Washington nor one more emotionally arresting.  The message goes far beyond the promise of: ""Never Again!"" to a far more haunting query: ""Can you be so sure""  Have we once again entered an era of mass political rallies that generate a frenzy of hatred and justify nearly any action in the name of nationalism and alleged racial superioritySimply put, the Holocaust Museum should be on any and every tour of Washington, DC.  It is a good counterpoint to the impressive monumentalism of the Mall and the federal institutions that fuels a justifiable patriotism but runs the risk of spilling over into the kind of xenophobia that justifies discrimination, fuels political excess and rationalizes the very violence it claims to deplore."

We spent over 3 hours inside the permanent exhibition and that was just enough.

Unless, of course, you want to explain to them the horrors of genocide or you absolutely have to. I will clarify this suggestion throughout.The first thing they will tell you is that the museum is also a memorial. They dont want you to be loud, and even one maroonedcoated individual said that if we were going to talk amongst ourselves, that it should be about the subject matter at hand. Take that as you will. There is so much reading to digest, that this is difficult for children and adults will have to spend the majority of time explaining/talking to their kids. There are short films 1416min on the 4th floor, and the whole time these kids were asking their mother, quite loudly, about it. I have kids, and I love them, but anyone under the age of 10 will only get nightmares from the graphic content. Just dont. Getting to the museum itself was relatively easy. Its just adjacent to the Washington Monument. There is street parking around free on Sundays, but its very limited. I purchased tickets for 12:30, but we arrived early and they let us in. I dont think they worry too much about the time in which you purchase the ticket. The tickets are interesting,  because the actual museum is free, but since its so popular, getting an advanced pass ensures that you get a place in the actual exhibition; food for thought. The tour begins on the 4th floor, where topics ranging from the rise of the Third Reich, to the Nuremburg Laws, and racial identity are covered. This is especially interesting, but if you are looking to identify how a nonGerman from Austria was able to incite this sort of radicalism in people all over Europe, you wont find the answer here. The origins of Adolf Hitler, along with his henchman are not a focus of the museum; since this is a memorial, much is focused on the perspective from the Jewish population. There is one flow of traffic, so when people decide to backtrack there isnt much allowance. The exhibition itself starts out very narrow comparatively, and there is much to read on either side of the walls. In my opinion, this design flaw leads to a backup of people and it can take a while to get through, especially when you consider most peoples general lack of awareness for anyone other than themselves. The museum is divided up into three sections; Nazi rise to power, the treatment of Jews during the time period their movements to death camps or labor camps, etc. and then the end of the war, when the Allied forces finally accomplished the job, albeit far too late. There is a very interesting segment on Americas perception of the Holocaust as it was happening and their role before entering the war. This is available via listening phones attached to TV monitors. It is time consuming, interesting, and altogether shameful that more was not done to help the Jewish people. Askew from the Holocaust exhibition is a general exhibit on genocides that have taken place and that are currently taking place. It's worth a visit. Carve out a good, firm, three hours of your day to dedicate to this museum. It is awfully cold inside from my perspective and I immediately regretted my choice to wear shorts. The museum says that there is no rerentry, but we got hungry after the fourth floor and went outside to the HMM Caf, and were let back in upon request would not recommend because the best way to get to the third floor is by going through the fourth floor exhibition again."

Very sobering. The museum is weirdly laid out and one has to have a ticket to actually visit the Holocaust displays and timeline. I wish this was in a bigger and better building because it was very crowded hence why it is ticketed. Considering they mainly have only photographs to depict what happened it was very good. It was disappointing to see so many teenagers just flitting past many of the displaysprobably desensitized to the graphic images and horror of it all due to modern media and special effects that depict much worse today! After the war the surviving Nazi leaders were put on trial and claimed they did nothing wrong because they were merely following the laws of their land. This is one of the saddest testimonies to mankind's evil when he departs from God's moral laws the Creator of man and does what is right in his own eyes. Human beings were harvested and processed their remains used for the German war effort, as if only animals, and this was based upon Hitler's evolutionary ideas of racial purity. There is actually a display of this at the museum."

Just so you the reader of this review may know. All the cushioned seats in the main desk were given to the white people. While most of us, the group of Indians were made to sit on wooden benches in the back with a less appropriate shading element for more than an hour. None of the white people who got on board before us spoke up for us, the Indian tour group, to this unfair treatment by the boat company. It set a sour tone for the rest of the hour long ride. While on tour we were told stories of Anne Franks past, how the East and West Dutch India companies colonial wealth drained from their exploitation of resources from India and South America set the foundation for the wealth of architecture and canals in Amsterdam. This only made our feeling of remorse, and sadness worse. Reminded us how we had been wronged in the past and the microagressions we constantly continue to face around the world as we tour countries, without ever really raising our voices, or retaliating against such treatment.

My respect and admiration for President Johnson grew so much. ,"The Presidential Library was hard to find. Its in the middle of the University campus and there are no signs on campus directing you to it. Once inside, follow the timeline on the events occurring during his years of public service and his Presidency. There is an extensive section on the role that athletes have played during the past 100 years to shine a light on racial, sex and religious discrimination and how their efforts and activism have helped bring about change. I was amazed at how many serious and potentially catastrophic domestic and global conflicts LBJ faced during his Presidency. Listening to his taped phone conversations with prominent U.S. leaders and other world leaders made me realize the depth of his understanding of issues and how personal connections are essential to reaching out and addressing opposing views or agendas. I came to understand that his commitment to civil rights and equal treatment for all was authentic and unyielding.  "

In this library you learn how LBJ started as a teacher, worked his way through Congress, became president in 1963 as a result of JFKs assassination but won the 1964 election and passed an impressive amount of bills and legislation. A hard worker with enormous energy and with his own special Johnson treatment."

Vietnam war was in full swing, students were protesting on every university campus, the protesters were shouting 'hey, hey, hey LBJ, how many kids have you killed today', every evening in front of the WH, LBJ realized that he could not win the war and had no way to extricate us, Civil rights marches were going on all over the south and the Southern whites were  quite upset with LBJ's civil rights and racial equality business. Two Kennedy's and MLK got assassinated. It was a period of extreme turmoil, but the nation pulled through it and survived. That made me less depressed about the current state of affairs and brought about the hope that when it is all over, the stars and stripes will still be flying proudly on the shinning hill. By comparison, things today, as bad as they are, are not quite bad enough to lose hope. LBJ pushed through lot of civic minded legislation.The library is located on the North East corner of the UT campus.

Situated on the University of Texas campus, it is a modern and rather austere architectural structure.  The library occupies three floors of the building.  As soon as you enter and pay the entrance fee, a docant gives a very good brief overview and orientation to the exhibits.   These are fascinating closeups of a complicated and contradictory President and his first lady whose presence permeates the exhibits in their design and point of view.  You go through time, getting to know the largerthanlife LBJ whose prowess pushed through the most progressive and widesweeping social justice legislation since FDR.   There is a balanced view of how he is often portrayed  A bully on a strategic tirade, a just man on a civil rights quest to level the playing field of opportunities for the poor and disenfranchised racial minorities.   The constantly repeating film similarly depicts both sides of this intriguing historical figure, as do the opportunities to hear his voice in fascinating ways, including telephones.   Similarly, the exhibit portrays a time in our history when the seams were being ripped open  and for those of us who lived through it, it accurately and viscerally recalls that time of civil unrest and civilian involvement, war and peace rallies, social movements and selfrealization, youthful hope and shattered dreams JFK assassination.   Moving and stimulating.   The fascinating Beatles exhibit complemented the LBJ exhibits and library beautifully.   Lots of goosebumps as you listen to some of the early middle, and late years of this iconic band that captured and changed the imaginations of the times.   "

As we visited this Library/Museum we were astounded to learn how many legislative bills he was able to pass during his term of office in his pursuit of his ""Great Society"" agenda, many of which continue to affect us today.  We felt that the museum's use of telephones, that one could pick up and listen to LBJ's conversations while he was in office, were a great asset and gave us a good insight into his personality and his persuasive style which became known as the ""LBJ Treatment"".They seemed especially appropriate as he was never without a phone within reach as well as having several televisions on at one time!

So, prior to my visit I thought I was quite familiar with the life and times of the President. However, I was unexpectedly quite moved by the scope and great significance of this Presidents legacy as presented by the exhibits. Through these insightful and engrossing displays, ones appreciation for his legacy is deepened as one learns how his administration changed the course of American life in a number of substantive ways that still greatly affect us today. While this attraction is not appropriate for small children, families with teenagers would find this to be quite a worthwhile stop. Take time to watch the videos and pay a few extra dollars for the audio tour to delve deeper into the exhibits. Allocate a minimum of 1.5 hours. History buffs could easily spend 3 hours, here.My only criticism is  unless I missed it  the exhibit provides little clue as to why Johnson changed from being one who voted along with segregationist Dixiecrats to one who supported progressive racial policies. Being someone interested in transformative life events, this would have aided in my understanding of the man who became the 36th President of the United States."

Upon boarding, the security guard disregarded me and my wife when we were introduced to him by my grandmother. Not a big deal. Im a bigger person than that. Everyone was having a good time drinking and dancing until we entered the lake for the second time that evening.  Besides myself, my brother and a small group of girls, everyone on the boat were predominantly white. The same security guard that dismissed me and my wife in the beginning of the night, made my brother exit the inside of the boat to tell him that he was told that my brother had dope and he was smoking it on the dance floor. My brother is a large Mexican man who also had on a flat brim White Sox hat. After, my brother told the guard, which we later found out was a previous police officer, that he does not do drugs, the guard made my brother empty all of his pockets and patted him down. Meanwhile, on the inside of the boat, the dance floor smelled of marijuana. I attempted to approach my brother and the guard to advise that someone is smoking inside while my brother was OUTSIDE, the guard began to scream into my face. Even after my brothers pockets were emptied, he was standing outside and the dance floor still smelled of marijuana, the guard still did not believe my brother. This is 100 racial profiling. Once we told the guard that is was racial profiling, he began to scream in both of our faces that he was not racist. For how fast this man escalated his emotions, Im assuming this is not the first time he has been called that. Not only did he racially profile me and my brother, he then continued to lose all control of his emotions, the atmosphere of the boat and other people on the boat who began to scream and physically fight. On Monday, we called to speak with the owner of the boat. It was stated that he was onboard Saturday night and was screaming in my face, as well as others, calling us fat and racist btches.

Another time my friends were turned away again, racially profiled and then were verbally abused on the way out by the manager and his friend, who yelled sexist and racial epithets at them.As someone who frequented Havana over the past year, I am extremely alarmed by the behavior that I've seen the past several times I've been.  If you have a shred of selfrespect or sense of selfpreservation, avoid this place.  Dangerous and undeserving of your money."

Attraction,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviewsg186338d6352835r194562018BazaarattheArcolaTheatreLondonEngland.html,Date of experience: February 2014,Bazaar at the Arcola Theatre,Europe,United Kingdom UK,England,London,A double bill of Spanish Plays ACT ONE,"Last Sunday evening I was invited to see A double bill of Modern Spanish plays created by Skeptikal Productions at the Arcola Theatre, directed by Natalie Katsou. Like many people, my initial thought was will Modern Spanish Plays keep me entertained for an evening The answer to this question is a most definite and resounding yes.The first of the two plays Bazaar by David Planell is described as a darkly comic tale that gives insight into the lives of Spanish immigrants and questions the notion of national identity and the individual. This seems like quite a large undertaking for a cast of three and a studio space. However, upon entering the theatre, I felt instantly transported to the dusty, dirty and crowded streets of warm Madrid, Spanish guitar playing rapidly, welcoming the audience to sit closely and drink in the sense of sun bleached wood and clutter provided by the sumptuous set design of Maria Kalamara.In the story, three very different and ethnically diverse men plot and attempt to have a video of what sounds like an hilarious bicycle accident involving one of them shown nationwide on a Television clip show. As they discuss daily life, plans for the future, and plans for the video, the racial tension and ongoing anger between each character becomes apparent and by the end of the story, personal identity has become the only thing that the characters have left to pick on. Although it begins humorously and builds to some very active and funny moments, the writing of the play flawlessly deepens its self to become something entirely serious in its message, both meaningful and clear. The use of space throughout Bazaar is fantastic. The whole stage is transformed by the opening or closing of a wooden shutter, the moving of boxes and tires, or by a very slick rotation of the central set piece which gives the show pace and a sense of time. Christopher Neels opens the show strongly as Anton, a brash but seemingly very clumsy man who swaggers around the city like he is the Don. During his interaction with Hassan played by Pezhmaan Alinia, a Moroccan Muslim immigrant shop owner, we see his character clearly demonstrate the depths that he will go to make a peseta or two. Funny, charismatic and full of energy, Christopher Neels presents the right angle of Anton, he is the kind of man you love to hate!Hassan was perhaps the most difficult character to understand. Without revealing too much of the story, he is seemingly very unhappy with the way he is treated in Spain, he dislikes the Spanish people and their values, but he shrugs away from dwelling on his home or past in an attempt to move on from something. But what  Pezhmaan Alinia works hard to bring understanding to Hassan,  but unfortunately the situations that the character finds himself in are so much a private battle that at times it was infuriating as an audience member to see him leave the action of the stage without explaining how he felt. Rashid, played honestly by Matija Vlatkovic is the voice of reason between the two cultures. He manages to bring a sense of togetherness, a sense of trust in which the other characters can reveal their true thoughts on the identity crisis which runs as a strong current throughout the show. Although he is not perfect and he uses his own identity for other purposes, he is the most relatable of the three men. He is seeing the situation through the eyes of someone who may not know what he wants to do with his life, but has a clear understanding of who he is. Matija Vlatkovic does a very good job of presenting  Rashids young but routed sense of self to the situation he finds himself in.  The production, although dutifully performed and beautifully crafted on stage, suffers from the sheer fact that the play was not written for a British audience. There were many moments that on later reflection should have been funny or moving or profound, but unclear of how to react, the audience made no response. The piece feels like it has been lost in translation and the culture that it was written for is not a prevalent culture in young London. Bazaar was unfortunately a little bizarre to me and to other members of the audience who struggled to find a connection to the show. I feel I need an understanding of what sort of real racial tensions exist within Spanish culture, to appreciate the severity with which certain things happen within the play."

It seems to me that sometimes so much is written and said about the racial inequality that certainly did exist in the South;the racial wars that were fought and are fought bitterly in Georgia and other States in the Union.  With all the stories of so much meanness,we can easily forget the innate sweetness of the land and its people, both Black and White, and their struggle to ward off poverty that led to near famine and, like the fictional Atticus, to promote justice.slow that it is to come.Sitting on the porch of the Chesser Island Homestead on a warm Georgia Sunday afternoon is a very good place to be.  The homestead is isolated, so its possible the Chesser family wasn't able to attend church services often, but I was reminded of the classic gospel song, MAY THERE BE PEACE IN THE VALLEY.   May we all find that:, no one above or beneath the Law.Now under the care of the U.S. National Fish  and Wildlife Service, this is a beautiful place. A refuge indeed.

It costs R65.00 as an adult to access the Johannesburg Fort, the old Black men's Prison and the Women's Prison, but you can also just walk about the area if you dont have that money and going into the Constitutional Court building is free.  Walk around the top of the Fort that's free and you see the city  you can access it from the north side of the Fort. Look at the most fantastic art works at the Constitutional Court including the most magnificent Marlene Dumas.With your R65.00 you can see inside all three prisons the fort was a prison too and be absolutely horrified with the conditions that people were held in up until the 1980s by all accounts the modern prisons in South Africa are not any great shakes either  however there is no discrimination based on face, just money. The old black men's prison is very grim visiting especially the isolation cells at the north side of the prison. Look out for a very interesting exhibition on Gandhi as well as one in the Fort on Mandela  both famous prisoners. The women's prison is very well presented and explained including the racial humiliation of black women.There is a lot of walking so be prepared with good shoes and there is only one cafe in the fort so bring water if the day is hot. I would allocate a good three to four hours to walk around and soak in the different places and exhibition.there are some odd spaces and places were stuff has been ""put"" and this in away adds to the charm of the place  as well as that many of the buildings have not been ""tarted"" up but left to nature and time."

It was very depressing in the jail itself, particularly the part where the videos were being played in loop in the adjacent cells  each depicting the life / pain of the person who stayed there. It showed that love was also considered to be a crime. From people being jailed for holding hands with a person from another race to having gone through prosecution for having an affair  interracial mixing was not allowed at all. Also, marriages were only approved / acknowledged if married in a church. Hindu weddings were considered illegal as per one pic. Going from one cell to other left one with such a sad feeling.The men's jail gave a stark reminder of the discrimination followed even behind bars. From the overcrowded cells, to the cold shower stalls, from the ""blanket art"" competition to get a little more preference in jail, to the torture cells with their torture equipment, from the food ration for whites, colored and black people to the pictures abounding with severe atrocities, all was a throw back to the past. Number 4 was where they kept hardened criminals as well as political prisoners  perhaps to affront them. Even Gandhiji had stayed in Number 4, himself being a political prisoner for having started the Satyagrah from there. Thus the seeds of Indian Independence were laid perhaps in Number 4. In the center was the spot where they made the prisoners sing by force to entice them to get a little relief from their punishments. The Constitutional Court was the brightest part of this visit. It had an exquisite and huge wooden door about 9 m in height. On both sides of the door, 27 rights enlisted in the South African Constitution are written in 27 languages  spoken or sign as used in South Africa. This shows a remarkable show of unity  solidarity in the country. A part of the old jail was pulled down to build the walls of the Constitutional Court and the Great Steps leading away from it. Again, symbolizing the South African sensitivity to give importance to the past as the way for the future is carved out. The visit to this place made me think the most as compared to any other place I have ever visited. What would I have done if I was ever in that era, in that place Could I have survived what these people obviously faced"

She is learning about it at school and I thought a field trip would be appropriate. I knew it would be a bit heavy and powerful, so I planned a boat ride on the Ohio for the afternoon.I wasn't prepared for the impact the museum would have on me. It was devastating to learn how little I had understood about the slave trade and the terrible illtreatment of slaves, men, women, and children.  We have a lot to learn and to face about ourselves and our society.  My daughter pointed out that only three or four of the first fifteen presidents were not slave owners. The reconstructed slave pen brought tears to my eyes and I couldn't look at anyone else for a time. The Rosa Parks virtual reality experience, the Harriet Tubman movie, these and other exhibits are well presented.  The walls have art. there is sculpture and exhibits about different aspects of the slave trade.  The underground railroad exhibit brought home the fact of how few of the citizens stood out against slavery and that it was not tidily confined to the Southern states.My daughter took it all in stride better than I could have expected and she seemed to be familiar with much of the history. The modernday slavery exhibit is gutwrenching. But it is a mustvisitsection of the museum.Finally, the implicit bias area was also extremely interesting and informative. Do save some time for that area.One learns about implicit and unintended bias; not just racial bias. I was struck by how segregated we are as a society as I saw neatly segregated groups going through the museum.Take your children and go often. We need to learn more if we are to face and be rid of this terrible history and its aftereffects that still tear us apart.The building itself is beautiful, stark and dwarfing. The covered parking is convenient, plentiful and inexpensive in the lot below the buildings. Street parking was all taken before 11 am when the building opens. There are clean restrooms and plenty of places to eat nearby. I took some pictures but I felt I was violating a temple to those who suffered and are remembered here.Take your children and visit.

It also addresses the persistence of enslaved labor today.The exhibits are easy to understand, attractive in design, and include multimedia elements.  Period artifacts are used to good effect. There are also some monumental spaces with large artworks and a reconstructed slave pen building from Kentucky..

What we instead found was a boat and yacht filled party island and park staff that think this is appropriate for a national park.  There were a group of boats moored about 50 m off from our campsite yes, technically within the park boundary apparently who played techno music featuring racial slurs cranked up as loud as it would go from 7 pm to midnight on Friday and Saturday night.  There was no way sleep was possible, even with earplugs in. Eventually, our neighbors called the OPP and Parks Canada after hours emergency line and the wardens very reluctantly came out via boat from Honey Harbour to shut the party down.

But this dream seems no longer possible. A row of boats showed up each night within feet of the shore, blasting music, yelling, being generally drunk teens I hope they were teens. We figured no big deal, the police or the park ranger would come and have them quiet down after 11pm  this is standard practice at other campgrounds and in the city as well  but nope. No one came, according to the people we asked who were all deeply frustrated by the situation, the ranger apparently doesn't have jurisdiction if they are in the water. And perhaps the local police don't mess with residents who have enough money to be yelling about their 50 000 boats at 3am I don't know the answer but honestly, the experience was disgusting. The boat partiers were literally yelling racial slurs at the diverse group of campers who were trying to get them to turn it down, the children in the tents around us were waking up crying, it was the opposite of everything we'd hoped for.

But for us and everyone else we spoke to the damage is done, we can't imagine ever going back to a place that can't preserve the beauty and serenity that draws us away from the city."

Like the early Chinese workers in the U.S. their contributions were not given due recognition. they were subjected to much discrimination and villefication  as with chinese coolies building  American railroads that open much of the west . The lower ground contained clay modelof the coolies working in the gold mines and model of their cramped living quarters including  kitchen etc. The 200 m Dai Loong or big dragon is housed along the stairways which extend from basement to ground level with the ornate dragon head on ground floor. On 2nd level, you can find more narratives of the period and how a handfulcrossing  the racial divide to become respectable  members of the local community.The 3rd floor contains more handicraft/workshops for school kids The 4th level is most interesting  for me as it accounts  for the  latest mass migration of Chinese from South East Asia. it contains stories why migrants were pulled to Australia notably :100000Malaysians leaving their country between late  1970s and 2000s in view of discriminatory promalay policies  and racial riots in 1969 according to one migrant's story on poster display there are also accounts of Vietnamese refugees whom came at risk of being harmed by pirates and drowning in turbulent  South China seas during monsoon months. Also stories of the Cambodians and Timorese refugees and their plight.Singaporean migrants' stories are also depicted as Indonesian with prominent Indonesian chinese lady now Australian called Lee Lin Chin, made good and whomis well known to Australian public as  she has been the news reader and commentator on SBS the ethnic station for more than 20 years !what may be is the 20 k Chinese migrants stories  whom were given PR by Bob Hawke in the aftermath of the Tian an Men incident.This is a museum about Chinese migration and may not be every one's cup of tea and nothing like a science museum that will keep young kids interested and occupied. It  would appeal to visitors with Chinese background or interested to know of Chinese migration history in australia. 10 entrance fee may also put off many visitors but  you can look out for free entry on certain days like Chinese New Year.Not too bad  be prepared to spend an hour and half here reading about history !"

Our experiences were distinctly different.The BadOur first experience with the waterpark was not good. We arrived about 6pm and prepared to have fun for three hours or so. In that time, my daughter and several guests were yelled at  by other guests  for playing water basketball in the water basketball section of the park. A young man pushed one of our guests off the pool stairs because he was in a hurry. An ethnic friend we brought was called a racial slur. To top it off, a father and son were playing highspeed dodgeball in the hot tub  so highspeed that the ball was slamming off the fake rocks and hitting the ceiling.We complained to the lifeguard about the dodgeball hot tub is supposed to be a 'no horseplay' zone and after a very weak request, the lifeguard pointedly ignored both the father/son and us as the dodgeball continued. Our issue about it being inappropriate for other guests to make racial slurs or police our kids' behavior was ignored altogether. We ended up having to be on top of the kids to ensure that they got a fair shake at slides, balls, and general fun. Needless to say, we were disappointed.In the morning, however, new lifeguards were in place. They whistled infractions, kept an eye on the younger guests, and made for a completely different experience. My same kids who supposedly were problems and/or had problems the night before were now just fine. They even played basketball with some of the kids who'd been an issue the night before. On a separate visit, we again encountered active, working lifeguards and had a reasonably pleasant experience.The main problem with the waterpark is that it is very small  bathers are almost on top of each other. If everyone behaves courteously, either by force of will or by direction of the staff, everyone can have a good time. The problem comes when the staff is not paying attention  these water features then become much too close for comfort. I won't teach my kids to return rude behavior with more rude behavior and with guests packed in like sardines, there is no where to go when things get edgy."

I was surprised that a musical that came out so recently would continue to have overthe top racial stereotypes of Latinos and Asians.  The fact that the writers paid tonguein cheek lip service to Asian Stereotypes was lost on the way it was performed.  I was  offended that the company did nothing to treat the subject matter if it couldn't be they shouldn't have selected this show in a racially sensitive way.  I finally walked out at the top of the second act after gritting my teeth through the first act.

I recommend it to everyone, including my family members, some of whom lived through the racial strife of the 1960s and afterwards, and some who never lived in a racially segregated and tense America.I breezed through the museum with ease, enjoying all of the displays and all of the exhibits.Yes the historical slave trade exhibits are buried underground and it's dark and some stuff is hard to read other tripadvisor friends already told you that.  Despite the poor lighting, the material was ""enlightening"" for me.The descriptions of attempts at family life preservations of traditions and rituals and then at the disruptions and separations forced and voluntary were especially poignant similar themes that I know from my family, cultural religious and Jewish national history we have all seen dark days it is meaningful and no coincidence to me that the National Holocaust Memorial is visible from this building and anchors the opposite side of our National Mall, with the monument to our nation's founder and first president there between the two: symbols of the liberty and freedom we are all guaranteed here.But I digress...I learned a lot about the role of the blacks fighting on the Union side during the bloody American Civil War.  Sad to say that despite being a history buff and learning all this stuff in public schools in the 1960s and 1970s and I didn't learn too much about this: we learned about Harriet Tubman and Uncle Tom's Cabin and that was it.  Seeing an original teepee type tent where 25 black Union soldiers all slept together was amazing... and sobering.I skipped much of the Reconstructionera history until the 1920's, times that my grandparents experienced in this country.It was meaningful for me seeing and viewing evidences of segregation from the 1940s and 1950s: not that I remember it personally, but it was within reach of lifetime and therefore somewhat ""familiar"" and not foreign.The 1960s was a hot time for racial relations in the United States I remember living through and seeing and experiencing much of what is exhibited you yourself already know or will learn the details when you visit; to see one's life experiences behind glass in a museum is both exhilarating... and sobering...The 1970s and 1980s, even though I lived through them in the US, were less emotionally provoking for me.Upstairs is the arts ,and I went straight for the Motown memorabilia, especially the Temptations just about nothing, and when I asked the guard why, he didn't know and Stevie Wonder a video spin on a thin type of canvas  There are clothes and costumes of James Brown and of Michael Jackson.  Oh and there is Louis Armstrong's trumpet now that was fantastic my daughter was shocked when I explained that in the 1950s and early 1960s, he toured the country as a national headline performer but had to sit in the back of the bus and sleep in a different hotel... at least that's what I heard.Anyway: without a doubt a great and worthwhile and free museum... so if you've read up to this point, you are certainly now my tripadvisor friend, so look at all of my photos, like this review, and follow meYour pal.Buc."

This place is impressive. See wood from a 1700's slave ship. Learn how sugar and greed drove the slave trade. Walk solemnly past the original casket of Emmett Till to pay your respects. Enjoy the Oprah exhibit with costumes, shoes, and video of her tv show.   I found the layout cumbersome. You are forced to go by elevator to the very bottom floor and then walk the ramps a mile and a half back to the 3rd level where you enter the museum. This would be fine if there were more benches to accomodate those who need to go more slowly or need to rest. We were there from 10 to 5 and never made it to the upper floors of the museum. You could do all the floors, but to read and begin to absorb all they offer, it takes a while.   Another thing you won't like is that once in, there is no leaving for a meal and coming back. The museum restaurant is delicious, but pricey. It's divided into 4 stations, Comfort, Creole, Barbecue, and Fish, so there's something for everyone, including yummy desserts. Meals are about 15 dollars. Desserts were around 5 dollars.  If you're bringing a family, bring snacks and be prepared to share meals at the the restaurant. It is difficult to convey what  a thoughtful, emotionally daunting, even wrenching experience.  Feel free to photograh everywhere except Emmett Till's exhibit. You take out your phone, you're escorted out.The folks in charge of the information and getting you around the museum are knowledgable and professional. Unfortunately, it's a selfselective, so the people who perhaps could benefit most from this experience, may not go. We are an interracial couple, and I was saddened not to see more White folks sharing this experience. "

I would definitely recommend allocating one complete day for your visit as the museum is housed on six floors and requires the attendee to do a significant amount of reading of the exhibits housed in the museum. I would recommend that you get the earliest viewing ticket possible.There is a reasonably good restaurant on site so you do not have to worry about leaving the museum.A significant amount of time spent reviewing the history of the slave trade And the history of the peoples in Africa. However due to time constraints I felt rushed through the sports andEntertainment sections of the museum. This is a shame as the contribution is a significant one . The architecture of the building is very beautiful but I did not see any discussion of the meaning and interpretation of how the building was constructed.The only negative comment would beThat there was not enough lockers to store our jackets.

Obnoxious staff and no chance of getting in,"I thought long and hard whether to post this review but then decided that I really value TripAdvisor and the honest opinions of contributors who have helped me make informed decisions about places to visit so the least I can do is honestly relate my experiences trying visit this museum. To anyone reading this review please dont assume any intent from the title of this review. My wife and I are liberal people with deep concerns about the current state of the racial divide in America. I am white and she is Hispanic and we both have a genuine interest in African American history and culture and genuinely wanted to visit this museum to build our knowledge and seek to understand what we can do to contribute to improving the racial situation currently existing in the USA. Having gone to the Smithsonian Natural History and Air and Space Museums and finding that they were free to enter we decided to try and visit the African American History and Culture Museum too. Even if it wasnt free we were happy to pay whatever the entry fee might be. We arrived midafternoon and were told that we would not be allowed entry since we hadnt either obtained advance tickets via the website at 6:00am that morning, or option 2, had waited by the orange rock the obnoxious woman at the entrance vaguely waved her arm in the direction of the grassy area outside the museum as she said this at 1:00pm that afternoon. We could see through the windows that the museum was not busy and since we very much wanted to visit the museum and had no plan B at that time decided to wait in the shade while we decided what to do next. During that 20 minute period we noticed the same woman turn away 38 other people all of whom were nonblack but allow in 6 African Americans who, in the spirit of honesty, may well have had tickets. This situation has got to be resolved though. We never had another opportunity to visit the museum but either the logistics for obtaining entry, or the attitude of the staff outside the front doors needs to be changed. Just imagine the furor if the situation was reversed and a white person was arbitrarily preventing the entrance of black people to a national museum but allowing white people entry. By preventing access to people who genuinely are interested in the African American history and culture as a means to educate themselves, this staff member and the logistics of the museum are contributing to the issue rather than the solution of a major problem in American right now."

Otherwise, a three because of the curation.I and my wife, love history, love museums, know more on average about African American history and less than someone who has spent any time studying the topic.What is great about the museumMost people begin on level one   the building design is very powerful, seven stories, from the bowels of a slave ship metaphorically speaking, not in display to the top level of culture, the arts, and so on. This level and the entire exhibit on slavery is not even close to what it cold have been. It is sanitized; distant; and in some cases factually inaccurate. The curators have created a narrative  fair enough  but that narrative obscures too much real and interesting history.  I could not find, for example, any mention of the Somerset case  look it up please  I may have missed it  and even if it was there that I missed it means the curators were focused on narrative not real education or history. I could quibble more  another example when the museum presents the critical role of Christianity, the curation states slave owners wanted their slaves to become Christian them and so on. Well, n many places, the opposite of the truth  in South Caroina, it was against the law for slaves to attend churches and instead they want to ""praise houses."" OK, I am a nerd.That said, as you rise to the post civil war period, and then on to the 20th century, the museum just gets better, so much so my wife and I are going back as we ran out of time.  Form music to sports to eduction to theater it was very, very interesting and the section on protest and cicil rights reminded us how ugly os many things were in OUR COUNTRY  not  a foreign country  when we were growing up.Best things  large screens with videos; fabulous photography beginning around the civil war time period' the exhibits on the military service and post World War II America. And the visitors  three quarters of the visitors on the day we were there were African American, this is their place, and you see on the animated faces of the grandmothers and the children how important this place is, how proud they are, and how some are shocked at the terrible treatment their forefathers suffered through. The museum, for them is playing a vital role in replacing family oral history that is fading if not gone altogether. Oops, almost forgot  very good cafeteria, very attentive and helpful staff as with all Smithsonian musuems.Worst things  a narrative that at times obscures critical parts of history and, worse, ignores the role of white people. Yes I am white this is not about that. How can you set up a music room  rooms  without Elvis, it was Elvis who brought black music into mainstream American culture How can you present exhibit after exhibit on the fight for racial equality without mentioning  or if they were there, I missed it  dead white civil rights workers or the black/Jewish coalitions in major cities that led the fight for civil rights, or the joint organized labor/black cil rights effortsThese are more than quibbles  the narrative is flawed  but the important thing is to go visit, it is a MUST place to go in DC.One last point  this museum is the only tourist attraction in any major city I have been two where there were no Chines tour groups and few Chinese tourists.

Controversial subjects are not avoided. I was surprised at how many historical events were described in detail that I had never heard about or had only glancingly been covered in school. After the sobering history lesson of the first 3 floors the top 2 are a celebration of African Americans in arts and culture: everything from science, the professions, television, and the military. Anyone who loves American music of the last 200 years will love the jazz and pop memorabilia. Who won't smile when seeing the mothership  You can spend a long time in this large and undoubtedly growing collection. The restaurant is, for a large museum, really good. It is a cafeteria with themed stations. I went for the Cajun/creole. The gumbo was quite good. My wife had the fried chicken which was accompanied by cornbread, greens and mac  cheese.  We were eating off one another's plates. It was that good. Even better was the spirit of the people inside. Staff were awesome. Patrons were all put into a sense of community. Conversations broke out all around the cafeteria across racial and cultural lines about one another and what we had seen. Surely that's just what the curators had hoped to accomplish. "

The building is magnificent and the exhibits are laid out in 3 historic times: 16th to 18th centuries; 19th to 20th; and modern years.

The factory became an internment camp during WW2.In around 1942, approximately 2000 people were transported from Camp des Milles to Drancy before being sent to their death in Auschwitz. The majority of those taken away were Jews, generally French citizens. Other people were also transported. It was a dark period, yet this factory, which became an internment camp, lay nestled in a small village/township, most likely in full view of those nearby.Look at the compelling video just after you enter, look at the exhibits and testimonies and look at where the people slept.

The band A Perfect Circle had their concert that day, and I had been looking forward to this concert for half a year. It cost me 106.55 for two tickets, and was also intended to be a birthday gift to my boyfriend, and this concert was supposed to be a fun, celebratory day. It was supposed to be one of the highlights of 2018.We arrived between 5 and 6 hours early in order to make sure we got a good position in the venue at the front. This band is extremely popular, so we had to plan well ahead and cancel other daytime arrangements. We were standing/sitting for many hours in line, patiently waiting for the doors to open, and because we were excited about the upcoming concert, we were of course okay with this. The point of arriving early was so that we could smoothly be the first to go through the bag checks and secure a good spot since it was a standing concert, which is important considering the expensive tickets.However, once the doors opened my entire day took a turn for the worse. Once I reached the security staff, a particularly hostile female member of staff asked me to open my backpack. I politely complied and showed her the contents, which was nothing unusual  Antibacterial hand wipes, earplugs, keys to my flat, my wallet, and an umbrella since it was forecasted to rain. The lady began to angrily harass me about every single item in my backpack, aggressively asking me about the purpose of each of them. It was extremely uncomfortable, and even though I calmly explained what they were, she kept holding me back while other concert goers started slipping by me. These other people arrived hours later than me, and still managed to get into the venue before me.The lady told me to open my backpack a total of four times, even though she had already gone through it. It felt humiliating and embarrassing to be treated so suspiciously in front of everyone. I am originally from a Middle Eastern country, and it felt as if I was singled out because of my race by this staff member. She treated me like a suspected radicalised islamist at an airport, interrogating me about completely innocent and normal items in my backpack. Other people who also brought backpacks with many items, were treated completely normally and walked past me in the dozens. My boyfriend had to try his best to secure a spot for me as I was being treated like a criminal by the staff. I was shocked at the fact that I had to explain what my intentions were taking simply household items like an umbrella and wet tissues with me. Nobody would ever accept this kind of treatment, and I certainly will not either.I can only call this by what it is  racial discrimination. There is nothing more humiliating than paying a lot of money, waiting for half a year, spending 6 hours in line expecting to enjoy a great evening, only to be publicly harassed by the staff as everyone else is easily let through. In the end I did not find a good spot in the venue to stand, even though this ideally should never have been an issue. It is completely unacceptable that I should be treated with suspicion simply because of my skin colour, and that I am forced to desperately try to reason with a racist staff member who seem to not accept that I come with the intention of enjoying my favourite band. It was so distressing to me that it has taken a week for me to gather the courage to speak out about this. I have never been treated so unfairly in any public place before, and I was being completely reasonable and polite towards her, displaying only good behaviour. I was held back for so long that at one point, I pleaded with her to keep my backpack so that I could get past her.Even worse, this experience has completely soured my relationship with O2 Academy Brixton. I can not even listen to A Perfect Circle anymore without being reminded of this horrible treatment I was subjected to. This is completely the fault of the staff member, and the venue who hired her. I sent a complaint email to the venue itself, which I received no response. This is extremely unacceptable.The venue ruined what was supposed to be one of the best days of 2018, and made it one of the worst instead"

Enjoy it for what it is.,"Sonnenland park is not Disney World.  But if you go in with realistic expectations you can still have a great time.  You are in Eastern Germany, and you will immediately see that there are still some lingering differences between the East and the West.  Without getting into geopolitics of employment, prosperity, wage gaps, etc., there are still some fun differences in fashion, speech, and tourism.  You will see elderly ladies with blue, purple, or pink hair.  Good luck understanding Schsisch if you are not a native German speaker.  If you are an Englishspeaking tourist, you may be the only one here.  Embrace this folks, and enjoy this diversity, because there is not a lot of racial or national diversity in the park, as the park is a reflection of the region.  What you will find are good, humble, nonpretentious people flocking to Sonnenland.  I know a little bit about them as I married one of them 15 years ago.  While none of my inlaws have purple hair, I do understand a little about why the Easterners are keen to differentiate themselves from their western compatriots.  Let's all be different, together!  Here you will see all those efforts on full display.As for the park, it's big and green and if you get lucky, sunny.  There are several rides for kids of all ages, there's a lake where everyone can have fun, but only little kids can swim naked.  There's a Ferris wheel and a tractor ride which circumnavigates the park introducing you to all sorts of wildlife, some of the fourlegged variety and some on two.You can bring you own food or buy it in the park.   They supply the grills; you bring the brats and the charcoal.  You can even bring in coolers on wagons filled to the brim with your own beer.  Find me another park that will let you do that.  In other words, you are pretty much free to do whatever you want.  In Eastern Germany.  Go figure.If you pay attention, you will soon notice that this park almost runs itself.  The patrons follow the rules, obey the queues, and don't get out of hand.  There are very few people working the park so good luck finding help if you need it.  Eastern Germans don't need someone to tell them to follow the rules; they will do so of their own accord.And did I mention that the prices are reasonable  Once you've paid the entrance fee, you won't have to open your wallet again if you don't want to, so you can have a great day without going broke at Sonnenland.

The embarrassment of the Bay of Pigs was a learning experience.  His contributions to America and his decisions affecting the nuclear world will long be known. Inches away from disaster with Cuba and the missile crises.  During that time of racial unrest he continued to raise the bar with his brother the Attorney General.  Not much is shared about his personal life outside of a few artifacts.  Not as in depth display as some of the other Presidential Museums.  But make the time.  Important to our history and a beautiful setting.  Surprising, not much at all about the assassination.  Take time to walk down near the bay and enjoy the view."

Its included within the Go Boston Card attraction pass however, its worth paying full price for!  The museum is a little bit out the way from everything else, situated near another university.  It takes about 4560 minutes from Cambridge where I was staying to get to on the subway.  The museum itself is excellent and nontraditional which I liked.  Firstly, you head into a theatre which plays a 20 minute video documenting all of JFKs life up until his run for presidency in 1960  its actually narrated by the man himself.  Ive always liked JFK and Jackie so it was really interesting learning a little bit about the man before he was president.  After the movie, you head into the museum which is filled with artefacts and short plaques marking key moments in his presidency from the Cuban Missile Crisis and his space programmes to he and his brother, Robert Kennedy working together to stop racial segregation.  Jackies clothes, JFKs personal belongings and key photographs are all displayed in the museum and theres even a special exhibit at the minute celebrating 100 years of Kennedy with 100 photos and artefacts from his life.  It doesnt focus on his death but more his legacy.  Its definitely worth a visit!"

It is well laid out, so that you get a sense of the times when Kennedy was president  the cold war, the space race and the racial tensions  and therefore of the importance of the decisions he had to make. The array of memorabilia from all periods of his life  from his childhood to beyond his death  was incredible. I particularly like seeing the handwritten notes and annotated speeches, and the quotes on the wall from Jackie. Well worth the visit."

Meditations were solid. But, I'm still processing what my more recent April 2019 experience means. I sat in a meditation led by Phillip Moffitt called Sustaining as Care Provider. There were 200 people in the room, 3 of whom presented as people of color. I brought this issue of inequity up to the front desk. I was told the primary reason for this is that people choose to sit with teachers ""that look like them."" When I began to comment of some of the barriers, other than racial profiling, that Spirit Rock has some influence over e.g. a scentfree policy, outreach methods, encouraging diversity through hiring and that people of color tend to be overrepresented in care provider positions and could greatly benefit from access to this resource, she cited that lack of public transit and/or the distance from Oakland were other contributing factors. These explanations, offered as finalities, seem harbored in troublesome stereotypes about people of color. I implore Spirit Rock, and Phillip Moffitt, to examine the ways in which they create a space that is not inviting, accessible to, or inclusive of nonwhite consumers. While the front desk listed a number of efforts currently being undertaken to serve more diverse clients, the statements made above indicate a greater need to understand the causes behind their homogenous clientele and to acknowledge the acceptance that folks gravitate to their own races upholds separatism, not dismantle it."

I was lucky to be given a complimentary entrance ticket by my grassroots committee but with a condition to lead 2 buses of grassroots leaders and residents to River Hongbao. I was really a green horn and don't even know how River Hongbao looks like and now bringing groups of residents to this place. Nevertheless, the bus drivers alighted us near the entrance of The Float @ Marina Bay where the River Hongbao is located and we walked our way in. This Float at Marina Bay is also the venue where our National Day Parades were held annually for the past number of years. The whole Float area is barricaded and security checks are conducted at the various entrance points. We went through baggage manual inspection to ensure no offensive weapons or explosive devices are brought into the float area. The whole Float is subdivided into the various areas:a    Food Streetb    Amusement Areasc    Happiness of Spring timesd    Harbor  Home Exhibitione    Trade Stallsf     Main entrance archg    Entrance walkwayh    Main Performance stageThere were many lantern sculptures depicting the Samsui women, the God of Fortune, the Wishing Fountain, our Garden  Homes, Abundance  Prosperity, the Charms of Fortune, Happiness of Springtime, the 12 Zodiac animals etc. I noticed there was a long queue at a stall at the Food Street selling fried crispy vegetable puff. One piece cost 4/ but compared to the rest of the snacks sold at the Food Street, this puff looks more stomach filling and delicious. To me, the exhibition on the history of our Singapore River meant more for the tourists. I walked around and took some photos of the lantern sculptures. I found them beautifully made. We easily found our seats at the yellow sector after showing our tickets to the volunteers who guard the entrance. The seats are opened to the public after 7.45 pm if they do not have an entrance ticket. It was breezing cool and windy if you went up and select a seat at a higher level as you are rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of a metropolis city. It was a pleasure sitting and watching the performances at the stage through the 3 LED screens available. As dusk set in, the whole float turned so sparkling beautiful and glistening with golden lights as the lighted lantern sculptures glow under the dark sky.The cultural stage performances include multiracial Malay and Indian dances. There seem to be disproportionately more martial arts performances. They would be captivating if performance are from the Shaolin masters and not the amateur children so the martial art performances seem lack the wow' factor. There should be more singers rather than dance, martial arts and musical instruments performances. The most spectacular content is the firework display. Many came deliberately to watch this firework shows. We also delayed our departure time to watch the 10 pm last firework display by the Chinese firework team. Indeed for the 10 to 15 mins duration of firework display, we were mesmerized while our heart pound harder on every blast of the firework that erupted into attractive patterns on the backdrop of the dark sky. Marvelous and awesome! As the crowd dispersed, we were squeezed like sardines through the exit points. We never realized that four of our residents lost their way during the exit. We waited for them but they seem went to the wrong direction and have to take MRT home. Luckily, Singapore isn't that big. Despite this little hiccup, I think this trip was worthwhile at least witnessing right in front of my own eyes the spectacular firework display."

Years ago there was a really popular drama series on local freetoair TV covering this culture, but as months and years pass the culture dies down.The Intan seems to be just an ordinary house on the outside, but upon entering you observe how much of a cultural sanctuary it is. Singapore is a multireligious, multiracial and multicultural society. I have lived in Singapore all my life 22 years, yet there comes an epiphany somewhere through the tour of the place; you'll see that many items in the house are testimony to the point that the Peranakan culture transcends, or is an exemplary form of, the Singaporean culture in certain ways. The cultures of Singapore, like many other countries out there, are merely where different cultures draw the line between each other and mostly do not cross the line. Indians in Little India, Chinese in Chinatown. It's hardly true in the 21st century but the fact that these separate towns are where the separate races congregate shows the inherent separation of the different cultural heritages.The Peranakan are different.One of my groupmates tried comparing the cases of coexistence of separate cultures between Peranakan and the global scenarios today, to see if we knew why the Peranakans coexisted across separate cultures so well. The host didn't have an answer, but after walking around the house and observing its artifacts, I believe I have an answer.The Peranakan culture is a synthesis of cultures that is built by marriage and love,and the cultural cohabitation today, built by merely geographical necessitations upon a general population can therefore not compare to it."

There is much more to Singapore than caning, chewing gum, gleaming skyscrapers and racial quotas; there is the history of some of the people who first came here and established the communities that grew up into this modern country. The Peranakan culture is an interesting story of blended cultures and unique assimilation and Alvin Yapp does an incredible job of weaving that history with personal stories, accumulated artifacts and his own wit and humor. I haven't been to any other Peranakan museum, so I can't compare, but this is a small collection that stands out due to the passion of it's owner and the help of his family and friends to keep it running. It is not open to the general public, you have to arrange a tour in advance, but you can arrange that tour around tea time to enjoy local snacks as well. You can also plan a dinner as my friends did and have an evening of history and storytelling.If you have friends visiting and only have time to do one thing, take them to the Marina Bay area and take the standard touristy photos, time for more, arrange to bring them here to learn about Singapore history.FYI this is NOT suitable for children, many artifacts precariously balanced on stairs and ledges just waiting to be knocked over.

This place is actually a beautiful piece of land before going into the campside but as you approach the camp portion it becomes dirt, rock and there are buildings around the land and is also fenced off with around 45 guard towers, which, the sign further down on the fence says something like 6 towers, could not see that many.Me and the few others I walked around with continued on to the area with buildings containing the holding area, ""the showers"" or better known as the death chambers and crematorium places. Interesting to see and use the mind to see what it must have been like to be here in those times.There is a lot of land to see and there is no need to rush so give yourself at least 12 hours to see this place, but go to the area in the middle of the buildings on the right when you first get into to camp area they have bathrooms and you can find out about when they play a video about Hitler, his time in politics and the Holocaust, very informative.

The bunker cells are gruesome.Tried three times to trace the route the prisoners marched from Dachau station to the camp, and failed to correctly identify three times. Various display boards along the way, but it really needs to be better signposted. As you some out of Dachau station board one appears to show you should go under the road, but I think you should go up the steps on the LHS just before the underpass. Then turn right, to traffic lights and turn right again, cross over and follow main road to camp. Only my assumption about way they walked, may be wrong. never managed to find board two, but board three is on that road to the camp.Portable GPS would have helped, but left mine at home. Not again.You could spend four or five hours going around the camp, and books  DVD's for sale are excellent. The best book is The Dachau Concentration Camp 1933 to 1945, text and photo documents with CD. Best DVD is the documentary film Concentration Camp Dachau 1933  1945.

Going through the political exhibition, the question whether Razak was a British stooge or not, does not pop up. His anticommunist credentials are mentioned, but not highlighted. It is as if his involvement in the military oppression of the communist opposition never happened, but then this was very much an undertaking by the British army. His NEP New Economic Policy is given a lot of attention, but the controversial aspects of it  a racial policy to favor the Malays Bumiputra  are downplayed.

Tickets are available on LiveNation but also at the box office located right at the TLA, which saves you the convenience and surcharge fees from online. You will be hard pressed to find great shows like these for the outstanding price of 20pp anywhere else.  Philly has an abundance of theaters for plays and musicals, concert halls and overall entertainment venues but most start at 60pp for any show. That being said, the TLA has little amenities and few updates to its building, interior and exterior. So if you fancy a place that you can have an expansive liquor selection, get a wonderful glass of wine or have a marble bathroom this is nowhere near for you. Negatives: The bathrooms are microscopic and often do not even have soap in the dispensers, their is almost always ""water"" on the floor in them, and the entire feel of the place is a bit grungy like it could use a reallllly good steam cleaning from top to bottom, side to side. Also, its 8 for a beer, and their are only about 45 beers to choose from Yards, Yuengling, etc. Positives: Completely relaxed vibe, they have chill bartenders and cocktail waitresses, loftstyle viewing from upstairs, 21 only section next to the bar on the first floor and a large standonly front row stage area. So whether you want to kick it on a stool and sip on some beer listening to your favorite bands, headbang and dance with up close and personal front row band action or if you want to overlook the crowd and get an on top of you view of the bands...the TLA has all of it.

See my picture.The permanent exhibits are also interesting, featuring fine examples of preColumbian art many objects are delightfully anthropomorphic, a variety of historical artifacts that do a good job of telling Mexico's history in all its glory and tragedy, and a display of historical paintings depicting the interesting and then thought to be ""scientific"" notions of ""castes"" or racial mixes. Properly understood now to be examples of pseudoscience, they nevertheless offer insights into Mexican identity. An Englishlanguage video  plays on a loop to help nonSpanish speaking visitors understand their significance.For amenities, there's a brand new book and gift shop, a snack bar on the lower level right by the river walk, and clean modern restrooms. Many days offer free entry, but the standard fee is 40 pesos, about 3 US, which gets you into this museum plus the Nuevo Leon museum connected by a glass walkway over the river walk, and also the exhibitions of the national palace across the plaza. It's a bargain.I have been to this museum four or five times in the last several months. You can do it in a day, or even a couple hours if you're pressed for time. Just don't miss it. It's as pleasant a spot as any in Monterrey, and it will help you understand the city, the country, and the people."

New Mexico was the center of many  active groups, violently disrupted Ny Spanish explorers looking for gold in the 16th century.  1680 PuebloRevolt is depicted  creatively as is the reconquest by the Spanish a dozen years later.  Timelines showing events T the time in the English colonies and in Spain highlight the interconnectedness of the times.  This is even more emphasized after Mexican independence when New Mexico and much of the West becomes MEXICAN AND NOT SPANISH.  Nevertheless,  the curators continue to emphasize the role of Native peoples.  Borders becomes a major them over the next 80 years as The US brutally conquers Texas, California and the southwest, including New Mexico territory.  The resulting Treaties of Guadeloupe Hidalgo in 1948 and the Gadsden Purchase a few years later doom Mexico to secondary status as a nation to this day.  During the American Civil War, people of Native and Spanish/Mexican backgrounds are asked to fight either for an extension white enslavement of blacks or for its eradication.  Water rights, the impact of the new railroad, and the rise of mining wealth all reflect the dynamism and rise of racial and economic inequality in the region.  The history ends with the attraction of artists to the unique beauty and culture of New Mexico after 1900.  The many artifacts, pictures and quotations make this museum of interest to kids and adults alike."

The visit, convenient by S Bahn was well worth it the site is striking for the well preserved Olympic venues including swimming track and field,soccer and several other competitions. Although the Nazis turned the games into a propaganda festival for the regime, the games were actually awarded to Berlin before they took power. To give the world a false impression, the Hitler gangsters removed anti Semitic signs, newspapers and overt militaristic symbols from the Berlin area to hide the regimes murderous core. It is important to note they operated a horrendous concentration camp just miles from the site.It is important this be kept in mind when one visits the site where many modern Olympic rituals were first used. The stadium has undergone interior renovation to make it a comfortable, exciting venue for sports and music concerts. The architectural changes enhance rather than detract from the original stadium, softening the harsh Nazi era interior. Restaurants are very good, seats are comfortable.The American military used the facilities following World War 2 .The entrance and ticket area is staffed by friendly people who are multilingual. A brief film about the site is multilingual as well, the gift shop offers tasteful items related to both the history of the site as well as the soccer team currently playing games in the stadium. A walk around the grounds is a pleasant experience. Signage is excellent.The highlight for me was seeing Jesse Owens name chiseled in 1936into the large list of winners at the Western entrance, prominently reminding us of his triumph that overshadowed Nazi ridiculous racial theories about the superiority of what they called the arayan race, a concoction of racist mumbo jumbo.You will not run into neoNazis on the grounds. The 1936 site has become a symbol of their monstrous defeat and the emergence of a truly democratic Germany from that horrendous nightmare into the postwar era. That said, it is critical that we never forget this was the site of games staged by perhaps the most evil regime of the modern era."

The choir accompanied by brass on Easter Sunday was outstanding but of course is much smaller than First Methodist Richardson by a hundred folks.  This is high church at 9:30 traditional but contemporary services  blue jeans, shorts tshirts, still exist and thrive both at Smith Hall at 9:30 and now the BIG sanctuary at 11 a.m.Small groups which are the newest hallmark of any Methodist Church of this size, begin this April 8th and are a way to connect with real people who have real problems which brings us along to the next point.Churches no matter what denomination, size, shape, racial mix, are hospitals for sinnersnot museums for saints.If you are struggling with any number of issues, and want to go someplace where you will be helped not judged, then a Sunday School Class or contemporary worship where you can meet Arthur Jones or Allison Jean might be a place to connect and confide and overcome demons.

You were wrong and you are in Britain!' Now this is when it started to turn into racial profiling, because he didn't know where we were from! I've lived in London for 4 years and have never been asked to remove my hat, scarf or hoody rudely by anyone before, always kindly and with respect! He was so rude and I'm sure the nice lady who was comforting my mom will share this with the manager today, my mom promised me she will never come back to the store and all 4 of us too until this extremely rude security guard learns how to work in retail!

Our room needed additional surcharge of RM300... Not a small amount. Upon reaching there, we were excited, but was cut short by insufficient car parks. Dropped a few family members to check in, the queue was extremely long. Only 2 counters were operational. What is the purpose of having surcharge We have been waiting for  2 hours just for checking in. Lobby area was overcrowded. Not systematic at all. People are smoking just by the lobby's entrance.. which is choking the internal queuing area when the door kept open and close continuously. This is Malaysia where smoking regulations is not really enforced. Once we checked in, we were told to wait till 3pm for occupying our room.. so we decided to go to the water park. It is overcrowded.. people everywhere... the floor always in wet condition.. although there was a worker kept mopping the floor. The locals are not really following park dressing code.. non swimsuit can dip into the water.. long pants, long sleeves, track suit, hijab.. as long as you name it, you will see it there. I am not racist, but please follow the attire code, as multi racial folks are visiting the are as well.. they will feel uncomfortable as well. Again, people are smoking openly in the recreational park. Even a resort can't restrict non smoking regulation. Clearly there are going for money but not quality. I eventually giving up to play in the water park as the water is not clear... We were heading to the room..one of the elevator is not working.. walkway is dark... Side wall lamp cover is broken.. young boys or girls can get electrocuted easily. Room lock not working.. even scan the card multiple times, ended up back to lobby again which is a block away... manage to get in, the room is clean, but a lot of equipment is broken... window shades, washroom water hose, intercom etc. No toilet papers provided, no towels and no floor mat bathroom. The sheer  curtains is spotty black.. haven't been washed for ages i believe.. Water basin is clog.. unable to flow water..  The worst part is safety, the window lock is broken... even a toddler can push and open the window easily.. luckily they didn't fall off the window, else it will be casualties.. attached photo Damn this hotel.. really frustrates me. Expensive and not worth of staying. Water flow is slow... not good for bath.. Breakfast is sucks.. not worth for extra money paid for extra person. Be smart, bring in your own food, better taste, happier.There are not much attraction nearby.. boring.. remember to bring in water.. a lot of them...I would not recommend this place at all to anyone.. i will never go back to this pale again... forever a bad memory spending my precious quality time in a unworthy resort."

A powerful place to offer prayers. There is also a statue of Lord Ganesha behind the large Buddha sculpture, visible externally. Each of the panels features Indian men and women as the Buddha was born in thenIndia, now Nepal, with Tamil writing alongside English script explaining each scene of his birth.

Firstly we had arranged, and received reminder emails the day before, to meet outside our hotel at 9.30am. The driver arrived at 9am, and was plainly anxious to leave immediately to go and collect 4 other passengers, so we rushed to get ready and set off about 9.15. We then waited in the bus for 65 minutes for the other passengers before phoning the company asking if we could either start our tour immediately or get a total refund. We left 10 minutes later and picked up the other passengers on the way. The tour description seems to indicate that we would have a leisurely trip and that it could be reasonably flexible to suit our interests. Instead we seemed to have a fixed itinerary and timeframe. Whats more we did not go to the final destination where we were supposed to have been able to go to little fish restaurants on the beach. Instead we were dropped off at our hotel at 2.30 rather dissatisfied and hungry. Other than the crowds, we enjoyed the places and sights we saw. It would have been more interesting, however, if our tour guide could have given us more indepth or informative details about what we saw and encountered. He did give us a fair amount of information but definitely not with the depth or insight weve come to expect from similar tours we have experienced around the world. Whats more right up front he started making derogatory comments about other racial groups which horrified us. In fact both the driver and the guide blamed the other passengers lateness on their ethnicity when their lateness was totally out of their control. I had to tell him we did not appreciate those sorts of comments. This is definitely not acceptable from any tour conductor! We find Santorini absolutely beautiful and enjoyed what we saw, however we were definitely left feeling disappointed."

But these riots obviously didn't represent all or most black residents, who realized full well that what happened was wrong; ethnic relations began to improve almost immediately thereafter. In fact, the neighborhood was originally mostly Jewish, but eventually many blacks moved in, especially Caribbean immigrants; during the racially tense 1960's  70's, whites  Jews moved out,  only the Chabad Hassidim of southern Crown Heights remained.    Today the past is distant,  there is no reason not to visit Crown Heights. The northern part, which is mostly AfricanAmerican, has recently seen an influx of whites moving in. There is a wealth of interesting architecture; use the architectural guidebook AIA GUIDE TO NEW YORK CITY.

The shop was completely empty except for a lady and a man behind the counter who did not greet us or say anything to us.We had been in there maybe 3 or 4 minutes when a huge group of east Asian tourists maybe 1520 people, huge for such a small establishment filled the room. We were at the back, far away from the counter.Suddenly my friends and I became aware that the lady behind the counter started literally screaming at us from across the shop to ""GET OUT! GET OUT NOW!"" and was waving her arms at us as if to shoo us out.We were mortified and wondered if we had broken anything or done anything wrong the way she was screeching at us like we were naughty children, and not 4 grown adults looking to make a purchase!We figured there must have been a mistake so we sort of made our way to the doorway  not quickly enough apparently  as another lady who worked there had appeared and came over to us and pretty much forced us out of the door!! She said, ""This shop is famous, and it's on TV, so groups have priority!!""So let me get this straight  either me and my friends are not ""good"" enough to be in this famous TV shop which none of us had heard of before despite one of our group being born and bred in Belgium, OR, this was a racial incident as both the ladies who worked there and kicked us out rudely were east Asian just like the group who had walked in.We received no apology. If they had come over and said ""Excuse me, I'm terribly sorry but this group have booked the shop for the next half an hour, could you please return later"" we would have completely understood and been FINE. But to be shouted and screamed at and literally shooed out of a shop like a fly or a rat was degrading and upsetting.Do not go here!"

We really enjoyed the hiking trails too. We camped in the primitive area and will never do it again. The sites seemed really small and most of them are out in the open, like camping in a field. It felt more like a weekend frat party than a state run campground. Many adjacent sites had 3 or more tents set up, 8 or more campers, and multiple vehicles. The ""quiet"" time rules apparently don't apply.  The first night a group of young guys across from me. Within an hour of their arrival, there was arguing and fights.They were loud and the language was awful lots of cussing and racial slurs. It was loud all night long. NDR and police were there 3x through the night. In the morning, those campers were still there. I asked to change sites and was told no, they aren't allowed to do that. I think this is the only rule they enforce. I'll add, the park people were not in the least pleasant and, at times, out right rude. Should have left after the first night but stayed because the foul mouthed campers left in the afternoon. Someone else came and took the spot. Another 4 tents, a ton of people, and multiple vehicles. There was an open area next to my site and, considerate people they were not! One idiot parked his truck in the open area 6 ft. from my tent. They turned on the music..and turned it up since they were trying to hear it across the road. They proceed to crack open their beer and the party started. Again, the quiet rules didn't apply. It was a long miserable weekend."

The museum has two main focuses a small collection of chinese ceramics, which I thought were displayed well. The room also had a number of activities for children and families, including drawing page and scavenger hunt questions. The other focus is the community of croydon, and its local stories, told through selected objects, from the 1800s to the present. All of the local stories really make the community come to life, and it was great to see some focus on what can be harder stories to tell whether because they are painful, or have been hidden in the past, like lgbt stories, racial tensions, or war. There were also interactive elements in this gallery, in addition to the touch screens where all the text and stories were. I think one of the drawbacks is that some of the artifacts are quite high up, and may be difficult for some visitors to see. Overall, I spent about an hour in the museum. "

Interesting to see how racial stereotyping denied people their racial inheritance as it was defined by those ""in power""/with influence. Of personal interest relating to this is the current change in defining the year from AD to CE  the start point remains the same birth of Christ but renaming it denies the Christian heritage of much of the world independent of race. Something to muse over as this political correctness that secularism can deny others their inheritance, especially failing to acknowledge other groups have a different calendars Muslim  Chinese for example so interesting that museum of man did not refer to those e.g. Chinese and brewing.

I only read about the Chinese labors in the nineteenth century  how pivotal they were in developing the American West engaging in heavy labors, laying down Transcontinental railroads and mining  yet living in squalor, paying hefty and discriminative taxes, governed under Chinese Exclusion Act and racial tension, and even massacred in some places like Rock Springs. Evanston took custody of some of the survivors from the Riot and a few of them spent the rest of their lives here. Although there are few Chinese families living in Evanston nowadays, people here rebuilt the Joss house. It reflects the daily life of those early Chinese labors despite many hardships, and connects me back to their days in the old American West. I mourn the tragic passing of my fellow countrymen. May the history never forgets. Thank you for resurrecting the Joss house for the public."

No support. No respect.,"We booked Phi Phi Island tour with Rainbow Lanta. This is undoubtedly the worst tour during our stay in Krabi. Why It is neither informative or fun.The moment we got onto the boat, we felt like we were in a China mainlanders tour and to add on to that, the tour guide was not able to communicate with them properly in English or in Chinese, because at every stop, some of the Chinese would come to us asking what they tour guide just said  both my boyfriend and I speak mandarin well. But okay, that is inevitable.First stop is a snorkeling spot, which I previously asked Mr Sak whether this is still suitable if we don't want to snorkel or swim at all. He said yes, so I assumed that we could at least walk around on the beach. But turns out that we had to stay in the wobbly and wet longtail boat watching other people having fun in the water, which for me is the least we'd expect. And to note that there is beach area nearby. Okay, I shouldn't have made such assumptions.On our way to Phi Phi Ley, the waves became ridiculously strong and our pathetic long tail boat was dangerously shaking left and right in the sea  people were screaming on the boat and water kept splashing into our face. Half way there, I was soaked and my boyfriend could barely open his eyes and he was sitting almost in the center. But that's not the worst! Someone puked... And then another... And then another... And more people asked for plastic bags because the puking smell in the small boat and the continuous wobbly feeling made most of us feel sick. I asked the tour guide whether he has any sea sickness medicine, and he shouted angrily, ""No! No tablets!"" As if it was something that he shouldn't have prepared at all.When we got to the next stop, the tour guide asked us to snorkel or swim again. And this time, many of the people on the boat chose not to as they were feeling too sick to do anything. They all started asking how much longer the ride was and asking us to tell the tour guide that they wanted to go back early as they really couldn't take it anymore. I was expecting the tour guide to propose a contingency plan, yet he didn't have any. He told us that there is one more Caucasian girl who was still in the water and we needed everyone to vote on this decision  as long as we didn't get 100 vote, we had to go back by ourselves. During the whole time, we felt like the meat in the sandwich  the tour guide kept shouting at us that they needed everyone to vote and he couldn't even get the vote from who were already on boat as he couldn't make himself understood, and the Chinese tourists kept complaining to us about how sick they felt and begging us to convince the tour guide to change itinerary. Finally, the Caucasian girl came back and said she wanted to continue with the trip, so we told the Chinese tourists that this is what she signed up for, and she has the right to continue. They understood and asked whether we could be dropped off at the nearby beach about 20 meters away to take a 30min break, since the next stop maya bay is just nearby in that area, outside is phi phi Ley and inside is maya bay and the Caucasian girl will snorkel there for some time anyways. The tour guide said okay, but warned us that there would be a delay in returning time, which I don't understand why, but everyone was fine with the 30min delay. Seeing that most of the people on the boat didn't clearly understood what changes it would cause in the itinerary e.g. Did we have to skip one stop or no, we asked the tour guide again whether water at maya bay is more stable, he said yes. So we asked if possible, maybe could we quickly go into maya bay for 5min after our break so that at least we still kind of got to see what we signed up for. And when my boyfriend asked, he was just trying to figure it out with the tour guide on what is possible and whatever the answer was, he would then translate into mandarin and discuss with the Chinese tourists for a final alignment. But the tour guide just blasted him all of a sudden after hearing his question, ""YOU DON'T DECIDE WHERE TO GO! THEY DECIDE WHERE TO GO! I DECIDE WHERE TO GO!""... Wohhhh, he made it sound like we were trying to manipulate him by pushing for our own secret agenda! To be fair, if he had been able to show more support in that situation and put his message across, why would we even step up to be the mediator/translator! We don't deserve to be treated like this when we were just trying to help them do their job. And I found out later that the tour guide was also video filming when my boyfriend was talking  I know they need evidence, but this by no means makes the customer feel comfortable.Other than above, 2 more things that I feel quite bad about:First is that they started pouring water onto the boat to clean up the puke without giving a headsup. And for God's sake, my sneakers were on the floor and the water was poured towards my direction someone puked right behind me... So gross and he could have at least warned me before he poured the water.Second is that they kept making racial remarks by saying ""They are all Chinese. The Chinese people want to go back early"" when explaining to the Caucasian girl. But hey, please figure out the nationality of everyone on boat before you speak it as if it were a fact, because it is not! And after all, what has sea sickness to do with nationality If there is no connection, why would you keep emphasizing on that point"

For example, the Malay folks welcomed the presence of Buddhist devotees/worshippers through showing the ways and greeted Buddhist devotees when they needed to drive through Malays fishing village to reach Chin San Yen/Green Hill Temple.Other good example was the Malays Village Advancement and Security Committee Jawatankuasa Kemajuan dan Keselamatan to take care Buddhist devotees/worshippers cars. However, the committee collected RM 4 from us at the entrance of the fishing village. They were not only protected our car but also guided us to the parking space. Its the good ideas. Chin San Yen/Green Hill Temple management committee offered the jobs for the Malay folks. In return, the Malay folks accepted the offer and got the pay. Consequently, it cultivated the harmonious relationship between Malay folks, Chin San Yen/Green Hill Temple management committee, Chinese Buddhist devotees/worshippers and so on.

Bass and partner Bernard ""Bud"" Westlund owned Apple Valley Ranchos Land Development Co.The inn, which opened on Thanksgiving Day 1948, is a landmark in the community and a prominent feature in the history of Apple Valley.The inn was a popular vacation destination for Hollywood celebrities during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Frequent visitors included notable icons Bob Hope, Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne and Richard Nixon in its heyday. Entertainment for guests included such performers as cowgirl celebrity and famous trick roper, Texas Rose Bascom.The inn originally allowed only white Christians as patrons. Apple Valley Ranchos Land established racial policies in its covenants, conditions and restrictions CCRs dated Feb 14, 1946. The restrictions were increasingly relaxed throughout the 1950s as GI Bill money was used to purchase property.In 1954, screen writer and producer Roger Corman set part of his movie Highway Dragnet at the inn with extensive shots of the lobby, pool and exterior scenes. In 1956, director Douglas Sirk and producer Ross Hunter utilized the same features as the 'Palm Valley Inn' in the film There's Always Tomorrow.In 1965, movie stars Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and their family became residents of Apple Valley. Roy Rogers leased the inn and restaurant, which was then renamed Roy Rogers' Apple Valley Inn. The Outdoor Steak Fry and the Roy Rogers' Riding Stables, with its haywagon rides and horseback riding, were two popular enterprises attached to the inn. Mel Marion and then Billy Bascom managed the stables. Cowboy artist Earl Bascom and his artist son John worked there from time to time. Roy Rogers' personal horse, Trigger Junior, was frequently boarded at the riding stables.After many successful years, the inn closed to the public in 1987. It was purchased by the Lakritz Partnership in November 2003 and restored."

Our first stop was to seethe statues of American Presidents.  Every president who has visited the island has a statue to commemorate their visit.  When the bus stopped, the guide stood up to tell us about the statues.  He began by telling us he didnt vote for our president so dont blame him for Trump. It is a fact that Puerto Rico does not participate in our elections. He continued on about Trump sending toilet paper to wipe Butts instead of coming to the islands aid after the hurricane.  He added that President Trump would never have a statue in that park.  Everyone but 7 people clapped which happened to be the only Caucasians on the bus.As we stepped off the bus, one of my family members told the driver that he was being inappropriate about making political statements in regard to his views on the tour.

We thought we were in the right theatre, only to find out, we were in the wrong place.  The usher was very friendly and escorted us to the right place.  The show prior to ours hadnt gotten out yet, so we had to wait out on a bridge way that over looked the mall stores inside Planet Hollywood.  It was a bit warm with the crowd waiting.  When we were able to enter the venue, I was happy the temperature was much cooler in the theatre.  The venue is small and intimate. There isnt any restrooms inside the theatre, so use the restroom before you enter, as it really isnt conducive to leave once you are escorted to your seat.

The Nagadeepa Purana Rajamaha Viharaya is one of the sixteen most sacred places of worship by the Buddhists in Sri Lanka. Pilgrims have been coming to the Nagadeepa since about the 1st century AC to worship at its famous Rajayathana stupa. The Rajayathana stupa was constructed by two warring Naga kings, Chulodara and Mahodara, at the site where Lord Buddha during His second visit to the country on a Bak Maha Amawaka Poya Day, five years after attaining Enlightenment, intervened and mediated in settling a dispute over the possession of a gemstudded throne. The precious throne was offered to the lord Buddha, was returned to the Naga Kings and was later enshrined in this Rajayathana stupa. History records that the Nagadeepa Purana Rajamaha Vharaya was developed and reconstructed by pious kings, Devanampiyatissa, Dutugemunu and converted into a fully accomplished sacred place. During the period of Portuguese, Dutch and British all the Buddhist religious places were destroyed and the Nagadeepa Viharaya too has been subjected to it and Buddhists were deprived of worshiping these religious places. In the year 1931 Ven. Randombe Somatissa Nayake Thero from Ambalangoda has visited this place and observed the ruins of the Rajayathana stupa and the Kiripalu Nuga tree and identified as the stupa constructed with the gem studded throne on which Lord Buddha has preached, and Thero then reconstructed this stupa with the support of donors to enabling Buddhists for their religious observances. Praveenacharya Damma Kiththi Sri Venerable Navadagala Paduma Kiththi Tissa Thero the Chief Sanganayake of the Northern Province is the present chief Incumbent of Nagadeepa Purana Raja Maha Viharaya and he is a pupil of former chief Incumbent Rajakeeya Panditha the Late Most Venerable Brahmmana Watte Damma Kiththi Tissa Nayake Thero of Amarapura Nikaya. The Nagadeepa Purana Rajamaha Viharaya is a shining example of inter racial harmony in Sri lanka and this had been improved at various stages and ever since it has become the most sanctified place of worship by the devotees."

Oddly glorious.,"We love the Main Street Museum and have been there many times over the years. For lovers of the old style of ""cabinet of curiosity"" museums. I was in love the first time I ever set foot on their creaky wood floors and inhaled deeply the musty, tangy, divine odor of living antiquity. It floods me with pleasant Proustian impressions of beloved old libraries, natural history museums, rare book stores, and Wunderkammers. The museum is a mirror of the world, but the parts most of us give little thought because they are too weird, inconsequential, foreign, alienating, or taken for granted.One is free to roam the museum and explore its abundance of wonders, though there is usually a staff member or volunteer available for a tour or to ask questions you will indubitably have questions. Admission is a suggested donation of 5, and a guided tour is a suggested donation of 8. Children under 12 are admitted free. Nobody is ever turned away for lack of funds. This nonprofit museum seems clearly to be a labor of love and the small amount of money they ask is just to keep the project going, not to make a killing.Make sure to call ahead. We have learned from their newsletter that they've had to make some changes to their hours of operation due to the ongoing harassment and terror tactics of an aggressively intolerant neighbor who among other things screams racial and homophobic slurs at museum patrons. To my mind this is not a deterrent to visiting the museum, it makes it so much more important to go there and support them in the face of this shameful siege.Check out their website for listings of their special exhibits and live events! We have been to events there and they sure do know how to throw a party. You get live entertainment, sure, but you also have this comforting sense of being enveloped in a community. White River Junction might not look  like much to the casual observer, but scratch the surface and you will find a warm and vibrant group of very creative and generous people!"

This is Trinidad and Tobago and we try to live here as part of a multicultural society not one where we look down on others or ill treat others due to some misguided notion that one race is superior over another. Last sunday was the final straw when i was asked to leave the grounds because i had on my sneakers by a pundit from the ashram, whilst many other persons of east indian descent wasn't instructed to do the same. He asked me in a very rude manner if i would like anybody to walk in my house wearing sneakers and told me the concrete surrounding the murti is mopped dailywhich is a lie. I told him i have  always followed the rules over these many years and was never ever told before to remove my shoes to walk around the grounds and not the actual ashram before by many pundits and workers to whom i speak to everytime i visit. Many other persons of east indian descent were there in shoes, slippers and sneakers as well but he only targeted me and and my friends because we are of african descent. This is outrageous and i will be writing to the ministry of tourism to inform them of this racist and disgusting treatment by the pundits and workers of this ashram. There is no excuse for this type of racism last sunday and the countless other times you were racist to me and other people of african descent."

I am usually a very enthusiastic endorser of museums, but this particular place drove me crazy. I wish I could break down my average rating because one part of this museum would rate a five, another few parts a one, and the rest somewhere in between.  A one rating should be given to the recording system used if you are not on a tour, which we were told was not available to us.  Not sure why.  The small recorder kept stopping and then one had to go back to the beginning and try to fast forward to where it had stopped.  I traded out my faulty recorder for a new one three times before giving up entirely since each recorder stopped working, and I never got beyond part of the second room with the recorder.  The narration on the recorder was secondrate, in any event.  Another one rating should be given for the almost total lack of labels or written explanations of the exhibits with a few exceptions.  A two rating should be given for the fact that this museum needs serious editing.  It seems that any and every artifact given to the museum is on display without regard to the worthiness of its place in the collection.  Someone with museum experience needs to assess the collection and carefully choose what should be on display at a particular time.  Then within each room, care needs to be taken to present the artifacts in a meaningful way with appropriate context.  This museum does not have much space and they have a lot of material; the result is that much of the collection just looks like stuff emptied out of someones attic. One exhibit, however, rates a five.  Along one long hallway there is a fascinatingly appalling collection of black memorabilia that spans a period of many years.  This collection does have labels and some explanations.  The casual and cruel racism of these pieces is eyeopening. I have seen other collections of similar material over the years, but this display is the most comprehensive and, consequently, the most revealing of them all.  It is hard to look at this collection without becoming enraged at the ignorance and arrogance of those who originally created and displayed these pieces.  If someone visits the museum with children, this particular display needs to be approached with a great deal of sensitivity and explanation."

On a Saturday, as soon as I put a step into the bar, one of the waiters suddenly came and told me that I could not enter the club because of the way I look like. That night I was dressing a quite formal black chemise and gray pants, while I was carrying my colorful backpack with my jumper inside. I don't think my attire was the problem. Indeed I genuinely believe that the waiter took that attitude because I'm not a prototypical white  blond hair  blue eyes gringo like the vast majority of tourists who visit Vallarta and fill up the pockets of greedy club owners like this one. I got furious at that moment and told the waiter that this racist and classist forms of social exclusion were considered as a crime in this country. He apologized and confessed that it was his first day of work and his boss told him not to allow the entrance to Mexicans who did not look particularly wealthy. I think this way of working is deplorable and socially unethical, and the club's owners should be ashamed of perpetuating these classist and xenophobic practices."

What I wasnt expecting was a long line of people of all ages, including numerous groups of teenagers, waiting to purchase tickets. Ive been to other memorial museums, and usually they are somber spaces, with school tours ushered through on weekdays, empty on weekends. Not this time. Tickets in hand, one gets into another line to pass through airportstyle security, then a third line to take the elevator to the fifth floor where the exhibitions begin. The focus of the top two floors is on the rise Nazism in 1930s Germany, the increasing levels of oppression directed at the Jews and some others, including people with disabilities, the invasion of the rest of Europe, and implementation of the Final Solution. The story is told through horrifying text, images and artifacts, including a rail boxcar used to transport prisoners to concentration/extermination camps. One then moves through a series of galleries that describe each of seven other genocides that took place in the 21st century, emphasizing that the call never again has not been heeded. But this museum wisely does not let Mexico off the hook. Several galleries describe serious human rights challenges in Mexico: focusing on the treatment of migrants, xenophobia, disappearances, and high levels of violence against women and girls. The last several galleries invite visitors to reconsider racism, fear of others and violence, and to develop a plan of action which they suggest includes supporting this museum. I had an English audio tour headset that provided short descriptions of each gallery, but the exhibitions were clear and powerful even without the translation. It looked like most the visitors the day I was there were local, but this is an excellent, albeit heartwrenching, museum to visit if you are spending some time in Mexico City."

I picked them up and to my surprise I saw them talking to a female staff employee.I leaned over the balcony but my kids walked away from her and it seems civilized.I noticed that another person waved down the female staff member and she followed him.I went to washroom while my bf took our daughter to car.I came out and my sons best friend standing at the front desk. Hmmm... I wondered. Whats going on here....He tells me that he is going to report a hate crime because someone called him the N word. Hes black. My daughter is black and my son is white as snow he has chronic myeloid leukaemia so hes small and very pale looking.I quickly got attention of the staff members because I was so shocked.Justin district manager comes and tells me he will handle it and they found the kids.I said no, I have every right to know why they called him a ""N""That is NOT okay.So lets say when I saw these kids, they were small 810 years old white.The manager did not do any service to us.Justin told me he asked my kids to get together and talk about what happened and my kids didnt want to.So Justin told me, he doesnt believe it happened at all.I asked why I wasnt called at all if they knew about this before hand. This is a not okay to call a child that is black.The kids who said it, said they never said anything to anyone. I got fired up, I took Justin to my car. Kids in the back seat. 2 black kids and my son in the middle seat.I asked what happened and I was serious. I didnt care how it started. I needed to know the truth. It started by my son waiting for his friend outside the bathroom. These two kids were at the basketball area telling my son he is a try hard My sons friend came out and told them he wasnt a try hard.It went from that to these kids saying their dads were hockey players and they drive all these fancy cars to calling my sons friend a ""N"". White privileged kids were said back to the kids who said the N word.Now to my disappointment, Justin laughed when I told him these kids were calling my son a try hard he has full blast cancer and can be awkward within his body but he is a quiet kid I also told Justin that my son never lies, I looked right at my son and he told me the truth about it. Thats one thing about my son. He wont lie to me. Justin laughed again. Justin told me he doesnt think it happened.I crossed my arms and I got close to him and i was so upset he didnt see the issue.He laughed, he fluffed it off, he didnt do anything.He said a few things loud to me at my car and my bf told Justin to not raise his voice at me.Justin walked away. No care In the world. Come to find out, these kids who started it,  got into trouble many different times while at the park. Why isnt a parent called when kids cant handle themselvesWhy do we send our kids to a save haven place and Justin clearly showed me, they dont care!Laughing at this matter and disrespect towards handling it. You should be ashamed of yourself, in your position.My kids loooveeeeee this park. I expect a response quick and this matter handle in a serious matter.Justin needs to apologize to my sons friend for not handling the situation and making him know that this is a safe place and that this word cannot be used.Its ignorant."

The content on display was fascinating with some of it so awful, I had goosebumps. There were some very powerful items that really got across just how dehumanised these poor people were, and how white people justified their barbaric actions. The video exhibits were particularly hard to watch but very effective at getting across the horrors of the slave ships. On our way out, we read stories of black/mixed race people in Britain and their experiences of racism. It was a good end to the museum as it drilled home that the shackles, plantations and whips were undoubtedly awful, but racism isnt just limited to these horrors...it happens in the streets of this country too.However, as a previous reviewer mentioned, the layout is very confusing. There are some arrows on the floor, but not enough to make it obvious which direction you should be taking. I thought the flow of the exhibition was slightly odd too...you skip from the slave ship part to modern day legacy to a timeline which according to the arrows you end up viewing in a strange order  they have you start at the most recent time and work your way back. Not how Id usually view a time line personally! and then finally to a part about life on the plantation. It wasnt a very logical order in my opinion!Its located in the same building as the Maritime Museum the Int Slavery Museum occupies the third floor of the Maritime Museum and entry is free. Gift shop on the ground floor had some interesting books on the topic of Slavery."

They have added a board with people's stories of racism which is harrowing and so sad. There are many exhibits also which shows what it must have been like. Many interactive elements also such as listening to earhpones and scratch and sniff etc which allows the children to fully understand what it is all about. They have made the museum accessible for everyone. In the same building there is also the maritime museum and downstairs is all about imports/exports which is also very interesting. I love how liverpool has put an emphasis on slavery when it was of course one of the major port cities which would have made it a hub for the slave trade, it is a very respectful thing to do.Not only is it about slavery but also about African culture and customs which makes it more positive rather than negative."

One of the most powerful for me, for what it represented, was an original Ku Klux Klan uniform.The legacy of the trade was depicted clearly by personal stories of racism suffered by individual Liverpudlians right up to the 1990s but also by the stories of people who had triumphed over such bigotry.My son and I were very moved  me to tears  by the exhibition.

Each of the exhibits were tastefully displayed and it gave an educational insight into slavery from the African countries providing an understanding from which areas, by whom and the trading results. The fact that these people were treated as chattels that could be bought and sold is a sobering thought but then again it still goes on today for women in terms of vice. It also gave an insight into the treatment of these people without being graphic. it also gave an insight in the racism that underlies slavery and how it continues in today's environment. I found it profound and disturbing. I also found some of the contemporary commentaries a valuable addition to the how it has past down through the generationsWhile I was in awe what has been done by and through the Liverpool authorities I would have like to see more exposure of slavery as it exists today, particularly of women.

However, I found the dominant focus of this museum appeared to be convincing its audience that slavery was a negative thing, something I feel never needed establishment in the first place. Additionally, it seemed to be a celebration of African culture and attempt to portray the ongoing effects of African racism in modern society, which given it is a meant to be an international slavery museum, misses the point completely.  Sadly, at times it felt like an exercise in promoting white mans guilt and very much felt like a missed opportunity to present a disturbing yet intriguing period of modern history. The information presented is also very disjointed. It is apparently been set up chronically, with the first being the life in west Africa, before the onset of transatlantic slavery. The next is in regards to Enslavement and the middle Passage, whilst the last deals with the legacies of transatlantic slavery. Of these, I felt only the middle belonged in the museums, with others seemingly too tangential, with political undertones."

Additionally, it paid almost no attention to Liverpool's hand in the trade and transportation of Liverpool, which would have made it stand out in the way of Slavery Museums. The exhibits mostly focused on how Liverpudlians of slave descent and not were working to right the wrongs, or move away from slavery, or pointing out the horrible things done to the people elsewhere. Basically, the exhibit could have been anywhere in the world. The few mentions of Liverpool and England and their involvement in the Slave Trade was minimal and dismissive, and appeared to myself and many of my classmates to be almost propagandaish in their attempts to avoid mentioning their involvement.The only thing I actually enjoyed and by enjoy, I mean appreciate was the special exhibition of the atrocities committed in the Congo, and the photos taken by a couple during a period of time to document these atrocities."

It's presented in different forms interviews, documents, artefacts, sound effects, photos, interactive displays  so much that you could easily spend half a day there.I agree with a previous reviewer that not enough was made of the fact that many Africans were captured and sold into slavery by their fellow Africans. It wasn't only European merchants who were responsible for the slave trade, but it WAS Europeans who abolished it!I was a little surprised that the Slavery aspects of the exhibition morphed into aspects of Racism, as if the former was responsible for the latter. I personally feel that there would be racism, even if slavery had never existed  although reprehensible, it's human nature to fear, hate or despise anyone who's ""different"" from you."

The first thing that confronts you as you go through the door is a wall about the 1981 Toxteth Riots. Sorry but that has nothing to do with Slavery, however you dress it up with political comments about institutional racism.  The few exhibits with factual information were very interesting, as were the films about the life of a slave. More should be made of this sort of exhibit. The comments from random black celebrities were unhelpful and irrelevant. Just because someone has a dark skin colour and is on TV or national Radio doesn't automatically mean they are an expert on the history of the slave trade. Fine if they are speaking directly about their own family history, but otherwise leave the politics out of museums and let people make up their own minds from the FACTS as documented by your own city records. Yes, slavery was a terrible thing and it is great that it was abolished. That point almost doesn't need making when you read the figures on your ship ledgers. But where was the information about the poor white people who were also taken on board ships to be sold as slaves Where is the information on those who lived in Africa and sold their own people into slavery What about the Arab slave traders There is lots that could have been said in this museum but they wasted the wall space on irrelevant politically correct vapid comments from celebrities. What a shame, but hey, never let the facts spoil a good story, eh"

And, yes, you can find most of that buried in the confusing bundle of information, videos, and interactive displays not all of them working available in the museum. But there's an agenda at work here that does not help. It's essentially: west/whitebad, African/blackgood. While there is plenty to justify that in the context  this was on the same scale as the Holocaust, albeit over a much longer period  we hear nothing about the Africans who were actively involved in the trade in their own areas, or the Arab slave trade on the east coast of Africa. The globally leading role of the British abolitionist movement is there, but only just.  Yet we then get a lot of stuff about the evils of globalisation when what's meant is unfair trade practices, and the problems in the Nigerian oil fields no, I couldn't see much of a link either, There was some good stuff on the lasting impact of the transatlantic trade  though it wasn't clear whether it was the cause or the effect of racism. But there was little about how modern slavery works, who are the victims and who are the people who exploit them, although there was one moving video interview with a former domestic slave, though we're not told who her masters were. The information about the exploitation of children and others in cotton harvesting in Uzbekistan was a revelation.I went in wanting to learn more and ready to be discomforted by what I found about our history, but left feeling rather disappointed and irritated."

The woman in the gift shop who sold us our tickets made sure we we're able to take their guided tour of the lighthouse that was leaving soon. The tour was informative and the guide was extremely knowledgeable and passionate. After, we toured the museum. I also noted there was a decent wifi connection in the museum lobby which I took advantage of whoever my husband finished up.  We had not planned on staying as long as we did so we decided to return the next day to check out the nearby heritage museum. Saturday's experience rates a 5/5. Not so when we returned the next day. On Sunday we returned to the area to go to the heritage museum but I decided to skip it and read my by the sea. I forgot my kindle and wanted to check if my book was on my Kindle app. I ducked into the lighthouse museum lobby to check as I already used their WiFi the previous day. As soon as I entered the building, the woman in the gift shop not the same woman from Saturday came rushing over to me, pushing past several other guests who were milling about, to ask me if I had a ticket. I was not in a ticketed area, I was sitting on a bench in the lobby. I told her that we had visited yesterday and that I just wanted to use the wifi for a minute. She angrily told me that wifi was for the cafe and if I wanted to use it I should go up there and buy something. She was so rude and panicked looking I thought she may have been reacting to my skin color, which is black. She did not question anybody else in the lobby. I did go to the cafe, bough a cappuccino from a very sweet cashier cafe gets 5 stars. I checked that my book was indeed on my phone, left with my coffee to read outside. Only I could not concentrate because of the interaction. When my husband finished in the other museum, I sent him into the lobby to see if anyone would stop him from using the wifi. He is white. He sat on that same bench for 10 minutes and nobody said a word to him."

His reason for not letting us in was in his words 'we only want people in this nightclub that know what it is about'. Which to me did not make sense at all, also this caused other people in the cue to feel very edgy as it seems that they have very prejudice security working on the doors.

We had a drink in almost every bar we passed for the mrs birthday and our first time in Manchester , 2/3 times our lass got asked for ID on the doors although shes 28 today but fair play thats no issue we dont mind ..... but this place he asked for ID and I showed him and as he was looking I asked him if we would be out of place being only 2528 years old in a 70s 90s venue and her just spoke back in arrogance and said yah what I cant understand what your saying , so I explained again and he said I think you have had a lot to drink but when he took us to the side he realised we are from the gods country of Yorkshire he looked a little pissed off . So then made us empty our pockets and metal detected us in front of 8/9 passing customers which he hadnt checked half of the IDs other half was passable but the other half was around 1820 tops !. Even made me look at my belt and top of my trousers and everything. Anyway after passing customs we thought well lets have one drink at least after passing customs into the UK rolling eyes  I ordered a corona with lime and a bottle of bud . Around 3 minutes later I had to jump onto the high top marble bar to point him to the bud bottle . Which the bud bottle was room temperature... Im guessing is which he didnt want to serve me it . We have been to around 20 pubs/bars/establishments this evening and I can hold my hands up and say this is the worst venue we have come across. Fair play to the security I agree being a personal licence holder myself that they have to do random stop checks etc but if he explained it to us and not just because we look foreign and cant understand us even through were english and from the almighty Yorkshire then hes just a sausage that needs moving to a different door because hes gonna stop your custom .

We were so shocked by what had happened we decided to take a separate taxi back to Paris even if it meant incurring additional costs  we were scared that we would be abused and humiliated by this guide even on the way back home. This guide was extremely racist toward clients of Asian descent  she had accused us many times of not been able to understand her clear instructions  for context my wife and I grew up in Australia and English is our first language. Instead of explaining to us the rich history of the Palace, our guide was more focused on telling us when she had to depart for her next tour. She explicitly said that she would not wait more than 5 minutes for a client on the return trip as she had afternoon commitments  this statement was extremely offensive for a tour guide. oOther points to note:Upon her arrival at her hotel she immediately told us how inconvenient we were located for her to pick us up We were accused of not being considerate when we had rearranged the seating in the car such that my wife and I could sit next to our respective parents who cannot speak English well and are in their 60s. She started screaming at us for this when a simple explanation would have been more than sufficient. She treated us like 2nd class citizensThe final guest we picked up was of Korean decent, but instead of listening to the client who told her many times she was Korean, she continued to introduce/refer her as a Japanese tourist. And throughout the trip made various remarks suggesting that she had to do more work due to the clients lack of English speaking abilitiesThe final straw came when we were accused of misleading the group as we had all taken Entrance B instead of Entrance A to Palace. Why would anyone want to mislead the group and enter the wrong entrance, when we paid a sizeable amount of money to come on a guided tour because we were obviously foreigners to the country. Instead of acknowledging her own shortfalls she decided to blame us for our lack of understanding of the English language. She could have just asked whether we didnt hear her instructions but no, she started again yelling and screaming at us as if we were 5 year olds and telling us we were RUDEAlso please take note that this is not a guided tour in the traditional sense, as the only information if any that you will receive from the guide will be dished out in the car ride to the Palace. It was safe to say that our guide was not able to properly explain anything to us whilst navigating the traffic of Paris. Most of the time she was confusing the various Kings of France Louis 14, 15  16 and their background story and achievements with one another. I found reading the Wikipedia summary on my iPhone to be much more informative Our general advice to all is avoid Paris Euroscope at all cost  our guide was abusive and rather than facilitating a new informative visit she completely ruined our experience.For those that care, the total cost of our tour was 356 89 x 4  for this amount we received a ride to the palace, a ticket to tour the palace, emotional abuse and was confronted with a racist. In comparison a normal taxi ride there and back together with tickets would have cost around 120 almost a third the price. Please do your homework, if given the choice again I would never have used Paris EuroscopeWe made a formal complaint to Paris Euroscope and spoke to Jean Christophe and was told the matter would be investigated and we would be called back that afternoon but this obviously did not eventuate. Clearly they didnt think it was a serious enough issue. We had also asked for the name of the tour guide so others may avoid her at their choosing but this was not released to us. So we can only provide you with some simple facts which hopefully means you can avoid the person in questions, our guide was a young lady, aged in her mid 30s with medium length brunette hair."

It is, overall, a very good museum; if you want to read every panel and take everything in there are also some videos and clever animations, you will need to have more than 2 hours to do everything. I particularly enjoyed the comparisons and explanations of the various major religions, as this could be educational for most of us.The following points are nitpicking, but would make it an excellent experience: first, some of the texts are too small, or too low down, to be read  if you try to approach some of them to read them better, you trigger the audioalarm ""Please stand back!"". This was a bit annoying, as there is no way one can read these panels otherwise; they are too low to be read by adults and I and my companion are not particularly tall. Secondly, it would have been good to present the nonEuropean objects alongside objects coming from European countries, or even Germany, as the collections did not include these. However, it would be of interest to compare  say  bridal wear from foreign countries at the beginning of the 20th century with similar garments in Germany of that time. Finally, it would be great if the museum allowed for a different order for walking through the very generously spacedout exhibition sections. It felt a bit as if one had to follow the exact route of the ""parcours"", and couldn't easily skip a section if one had had enough.Not a place to go to again and again, but I could definitely envisage going back some time  maybe with a younger family member in tow, so that they had their eyes opened as much as I did."

The NoPointMuseum,"There are good facts about this museum. First and foremost the technology they are using is impressive,except for the audio guide there are showcases which wait for your touch to light up and display the description of the artifacts,interactive books which display their content after the page is turned and many audiovisual descriptions. The welcome video is very moving, people from all over the world greeting each other and the guest in their language, I couldn't get enough of it. Also the personnel is very helpful, excluding the man in the audioguide desk which speaks very little English and gets rude when you ask him questions although it was not my fault he gave me the wrong audio guide... And that's about it.The main subject of this museum is supposed to be antiracism, displaying objects and aspects of everyday life in the former European colonies,together with the stories of the discoveries/exploitation of those lands. First and foremost,it goes wayyyyy on about the discoverers,how they got tattoos,how were their houses decorated etc etc. Why would anybody be interested in such details ""here is the basin that dr. Oppenheimer used when shaving...."" Seriously When we leave dr. Oppenheimer's lavishly decorated salon,we are placed in a big white room which shows videos describing how coloured peoplebwhere considered dangerous and/or contaminated,and how they were exploited and how that is wrong and so on. Those descriptions however are done in such an intense tone that they border on racism towards Europeans. As a European I didn't enjoy that very much. I like to believe that those where mistaken opinions of the past and to move on, not have someone throw them in my face. I am fully aware that our separate societies can't be considered 100 percent racismfree, but my main argument is this : even if there are such narrow minded people they will never visit such a museum to have their narrowmindedness thrown in their faces. For the more understanding people like me however, this museum was mostly a live repetition of the things/stories/utensils that I had already seen in encyclopedias.My third and final argument about this museum is that the showcases are DISTURBING! And it gets worse room by room! Voodoo dolls, hideous headdresses, the ugliest statues I had ever seen, videos of wailing during funerals and live making of mummies Shouldn't someone have put these in the description I don't have a very thick stomach and frankly, I left disturbed, to put it mildly. Last but not least, in the description it is mentioned that 12 hours are needed to see everything. Normally that would be the case, however, the audio guide goes on and on about every showcase for around 4 minutes and there are approximately 100 showcases. Adding the videos and the inwall audio descriptions,one might as well need 34 hours to see and hear everything as detailed as it's supposed to be. Needless to say, the endless rambling of the audioguide bothered me so much I hardly used it... Summarizing the above, I think this would be a hit museum some 3040 years earlier but for 2014 I think it's a bit outdated and blah, technology aside. Also fair warning, it is NOT pretty. I wouldn't rate it an experience I would have liked to have skipped, but it wasn't pleasant either."

Unlike many such collections which are a jumble of unrelated items  this one has been put into an intelligent order and context. It has taken the theme that all human beings have the same motivation to display their gender, status, wealth, power, by means of outward appearance and rituals. So the ritualistic dress of Queen Elizabeth opening parliament with a crown and medals etc. is put side by side with the headman of a tribe in Africa or Asia wearing feathers or animal skin or some bones to show status and privilege. Suddenly the natives did not look so strange after all and Queen Elizabeth could also be seen in the context of a leader of a tribe. One of the items in the museum which struck home was the question ""When did you realize you were white""  This was in the context of the racism we take for granted around us from advertisements for chocolate using black people as ""exotic"" to cartoons about cannibalism. I left the museum with many ideas to think about which made the visit worth while. I have not mentioned the modern building and all the facilities including a bookshop and cafe. If you are in Cologne I would encourage you to visit for 10 euros entrance fee no reduction for OAPs unfortunately."

Nasty racism","This university managed to present me with a narrowminded blind arrogance of Catalan ethnocentrism. Let alone the staff members always put a poker face as if you owe them one million euros. Regarding the academic spirit of this university, it is more than ridiculous. A typical example is what happened in my thesis defense, in which my thesis composed in English was being judged by a catalan professor who did not speak English at all.CAN YOU BELIEVE THATThe courses I enrolled in were 100 lectured in English as announced by the uni, yet in the final defense you sent a Catalan who did not know English to judge my effort and my work and my contributionWHERE IS YOUR CONSCIENCEFurthermore, in my study there were two groups being compared Turkish and Chinese students with B2 level of Spanish and English. However, during my defense, this catalan woman said in Spanish that even if when both the Chinese and Turkish student groups have the same level of B2, Chinese students still perform worse than Turkish students. REALLY I WAS SHOCKED.I am not sure whether I am being oversensitive, but still I sense that her statement is tinted with racial discrimination. Meanwhile, I am not sure from what database she managed to render such a conclusion. If there is one, please do share with me.Second, this catalan woman disapproved of my ""lengthy"" reference list. But if my memory does serve me well, the standards in the TFM do require students to faithfully reflect their literature references in the work. Although she stated that it was impossible for me to read that much, thus again I am confused: Is reading ""too much"" a mistake for those who strive in academic field Is faithfully reflecting the literature review also a mistake And on what basis was she certain that i was ""not possible to read that much"" Plus, when announcing my grade, she simply walked out and told my grade while refusing to let me enter into the classroom. Thus I really have no idea what I have done to be treated so differently.Also, I am aware of the fact that she is unable to pronounce my Chinese name, but it was not necessary for her to show such contempt on her facial expression."

In terms of actual education, the university is a joke. Everyone gets accepted. The administration is rude and horrendous. No one wants to help you. No one wants to do anything. OMA international office is never open. Professors come late, or sometimes don't even show up to class. You have to chase professors and university administration for something as basic as a course syllabus. A good amount of antisemitism among the professors, as well as racism, and proCatalonia independence propaganda is everywhere. Even if you are an exchange student, and don't know a word of Catalan, all communication is done in Catalan, without the option of changing it to Spanish or English. Do yourself, and your education a favour, and skip out on this university."

I was confronted by a rude unprofessional team member named 'Carmella Cox' who demanded I immediatly leave the cinema and find ID for my younger sibling. she was chewing gum whilst speaking to me and used the slang and foul language ""stupid cow"" towards me. Finally when I returned with her ID I asked to speak to the manager to give a formal complaint whom I was turned away by as he stated due to the fact that I raised concerns I was a target of racism this somehow was me being racist.Therefore after wasting 1 hour of my time I was refused to watch the film. The man's name was 'Adam Watts' who was the most disrespectful ill mannered manager I have ever met at a professional establishment. I myself am a general manager and I always treat all customers with fairness, respect and equality. I strongly believe and will be pursuing a formal police complaint that article 19 of my human rights was completely violated. Article 19 states ""freedom of opinion and information"" therefore when I raised concerns about being a potential victim of racism to my younger sister and NOT at the staff my conversation was monitored and later reported as abuse to the general manager which lead to me being escorted by security for bringing up the universal declaration of human rights. Upon leaving the cinema the general manager was shouting abusive foul comments to me and my younger sister which attracted attention by other customers who where also very shocked. I am extremely upset about this and am in so much shock that I will be reporting this to the police asap. This is truly disgusting behaviour!!!

I enquired from my hotel The Parc Hotel Gritti and they recommended me to go here for a quality water sport. After walking all the way to this place, I saw two young men who seemed to work at this place or even run it talking to each other. I took a while to go thru their rate card and then the younger one of the two men approached me enquiring my interests. At the same time a family of 3 from Germany walked. After some discussion between the older one and the younger one I was told they were booked. This happened after the German family finished their discussion with the older guy. I then challenged and asked them why didn't you tell me before these Germans got here. He then changed his reasoning and said the wind conditions are are not good for a sail. What he didn't realise is that I was fluent in German and I knew what the German family spoke to this guy. It was a simple case o mathematics. A business for three is better than one.But again I felt it was a case of racism than anything else because of certain things which I observed such as his unwillingness to talk to me or not responding directly to my queries etc. The younger guy was Italian and was keen to accommodate me. I gave a feedback to my hotel upon my return not to recommend this place to anyone else. Even if they give me a free ride, I ain't taking one from here."

Initially booked for a date and then told less than 24 hours before that this wouldn't be going ahead. After about four voicemail messages and numerous emails managed to get a response and rebooked  though I wish I'd just gone with the refund.Fraser Island is beautiful and I camped in a lovely location and the facilities were adequate  hence the two stars.However what did let it down was:1. The transportation: after settling ourselves in we were told that there was no aircon, no radio and the speedometer was broken. It was later found that half of the seatbelts in the back were either missing or defective the group tour was a total of eight. There was a Bluetooth speaker which meant that one of the group played endless Ed Sheeran, Oasis and Shakira.2. The driving: the terrain on the Fraser Island is certainly not flat so there is obviously an expectation of a bumpy ride, however the driver seemed to delight in riding rough shod to hear the squeals from those in the back. He seemed to always be surprised b the break pedal which meant harsh stops and people being thrown around.3. The racism: the tour was led by an ""Australian"" and I only say Australian in quotations, as I mean not a native of the country. His views on the indigenous population was inflammatory at best  they being simple and ungrateful that people took over their land and killed and enslaved them. Thankfully and yes I mean this sarcastically these weren't the only brown people that he took against and rated about ""PC gone mad""  the debate around the nursery rhyme ba ba black sheep was interesting.The only positive thing I would add is that his racism seems to borne of ignorance rather than malice.4. I assume he is a fan of Clive Palmer as along with as along with his views on ""other Australians"" his views on gun control were insightful.His knowledge of the island and the animals were very good and had he stuck to that it would have been lovely  or at least gauged the temperament of the group, before espousing his rhetoric. Though one in my group did find a hole in her tent which led to waking up to find a mouse in with her; the accommodation was nice and sleeping to the sound of the ocean was lovely. The food was plentiful and well cooked so no complaints there."

Regrettably, when we arrived at the club the welcoming wasn't good at all. At the door, they first looked at us as if we were beggars, asked for our IDs and then refused to let us in. According to what they said at the door, it wasn't enough to have our national IDs, we needed an Australian driving license. Well, we arrived to Oz a week ago and don't have that, of course. Then they asked why didn't we have our passports, we answered that we never hang out with our passports, as in case you loose it then it's a hassle to get a new one while abroad. Moreover, we spent six months in Melbourne at the beginning of the year and this was the first time someone asked for our passport to join a party. When we asked why they don't clarify that on the event's webpage, they answered that this is Australian Law, so they have no obligation to write something which is 'already known'. Alright, we could accept it if that's something imposed institutionally, but then we realized that this procedure was not applying to all guests who were entering the party. A friend of us from Northern Europe was allowed in with his national ID, but it seems like our IDs were not as valid as his. We had our national IDs on us, as well as our affiliation card to university as we're both PhD researchers. We also said that we had the scan of our passports in our phone, but no way. We were not allowed to the party. If the same policy applied to all guest everything would be alright, but if you let in a blond, blue eye guy from northern Europe with his national ID, and treat like dogs other persons who show the same kind of identifications but have dark skin and brown hair, then we can't see any other reason but racism! Yeah, this club and its employees are RACISTS! We love this country and its inhabitants, but yesterday we felt discriminated on the base of some kind of white supremacist ideology that gave us a very bad impression about the club, the organizing crew and Australia as a whole. We don't like to generalize, but please consider that this is the impression this club and the employees give of your country, and I think you should be ashamed not just with us, but also with all your connationals who don't believe in exclusion, discrimination and racism.Hope you had a great partyRegards"

I had to face the tantrums of a grumpy co passenger behind me who refused to let me recline my seat though the person in front reclined it to the fullest extent. When I pointed this out to the stewardess instead of convincing the grumpy co passenger she told me curtly to put my seat ahead. Barely a few minutes later when i was informing my family over a 1 minute call that I have boarded safely, the stewardess came back with a complaint from the same copassenger saying I should disconnect the call since the others were getting disturbed listening to a foreign language. Looking at my plight a kind co passenger exchanged his seat with mine but he was made to go through the same torture of discrimination. The stewardess revised to serve the Asian customers like us after the initial round of beverages. If called she would screech WAIT and scamper off never to return for taking order. She also forcefully charged most of us for extra baggage for the small bags which are considered as cabin baggage in aircrafts. Her behaviour completely changed when an European passenger took the seat I had left in the night and told off the grumpy co passenger bluntly that she had to be more accommodating towards others in the bus. Thats when I protested again and the Stewardess assigned a new seat to the grumpy lady.To my consternation I had sent a complaint email to the management that very evening which was responded to a month later. They narrated a biased story and sided their staff and blamed me for the incorrect position of my seat and my loud phone calls. I was traveling solo and my phone call had barely lasted a minute. No foreign traveler would blow up a fortune on making international phone calls during their trip abroad.Nevertheless I am appalled by their abominable service and lack of apathy towards customers. They are extremely shortsighted in their approach. My second trip to Budapest with them was hassle free and they did not charge me for the same baggage. Even after pointing that out the management felt as a passenger I was crying foul.Flixbus is better any day. They treat all customers equally with the same amount of attention. Moral of the story: Better to travel by Flixbus though its a wee bit more pricey but ensure peace of mind and self respect is intact. Regiojet should do a reality check."

It hits home what racism is capable of doing. Unfortunately be warned we were part of a large group approx 20 people and it seemed there were multiple groups  being pushed through giving you little time to absorb and reflect. Our tour guide was a nice man who spoke good English but unfortunately I struggled to understand him at times due his deep highly accented voice. During Auschwitz we did however have headsets so despite struggling with my arthritic hips and always holding the group up I did get to hear about most of what others could see. Felt rushed and struggled with the fast pace. No access for wheelchair users to safely visit. The ground was rough and muddy so wear good boots. Auschwitz have 1.5 million visitors a year so I can understand the speed needed to get every one of us around but I wish I could have had more time to reflect at a less painful walking speed. If you have any mobility issues then you may struggle. I wish I'd done a little more research on the types of tours before I booked. Perhaps a top private tour would be better for you and take advice from the organisers who may be able to accomodate you better. Will cost more but try and go. All schools should take children over 13 year of age on a mandatory visit. Highly recommend. Its harrowing.

This had 2 parts  1 hour of castle tour  30 mins of city tour. The castle tour went smoothly and was informative.  Next was the city tour. Unfortunately, I had such a horrifying racist experience here with the guy handling the counter, that it left me in tears.This guy's name was Vladimir and he was wearing the company's yellow tshirt. He was courteous in the beginning. I was the only passenger and we were waiting for a couple of more to join in the 6 seater presporacik ride across the city. Things turned for the worse when a family of 4 came in. One of the family members started occupying my seat. When I said that I am sitting there and hence my belongings are there, one of them started to protest saying they wanted to sit there. It was fine till here and we would have resolved this matter ourselves.All of a sudden, the company representative, Vladimir jumps in and says I am the chief here, a family will be given the first preference so you must either take the leftover seat or Get Out of the Bus. I was taken aback with this attitude and explained to him that I can take the next seat too. But he said No, the only option for me is the seats that were leftover after the 4 people had occupied their seats and if I don't like it I should GET OUT OF THE BUS. Having said this insultingly he banged the door on my face leaving me standing outside.I had already paid and there was no time for me to see Bratisalva later as I was leaving shortly so I went on the tour despite feeling humiliated and in tears. I wanted to see the city despite this man making it such a miserable situation. Bad decision. While on the 30 min ride, I called the tour office info@tour4u.sk twice and emailed them 34 times in a span of 4 hours...all they had to say was we are the best tour company here, this cannot be possible. I asked them to verify the story with the bus driver who was sympathetic to me as he could see how downright insulting and rude the company representative was.Anyways, the story doesnt end here. Once I got back to the same spot, I asked the Vladimir and the people wearing the yellow tshirt that I would like to speak with the manager. VLADIMIR says that I am the manager here and he continues You get out from this country, GO TO YOUR COUNTRY. Wow! After all the insults earlier, now I get a first hand taste of what racism against brown skin is. As a single brown woman traveller, being judged and insulted for your skin color from a white man of Tour4u was quite the experience. Having travelled to quite some countries in Europe, Asia, Middle East, Africa, honestly I have only had the nicest experiences. In Bratislava too, the people have been so nice and warm, I will try hard and not let one person from tour4u tainting that opinion.One advice  explore other options. This one is not just worth it."

From being asked to leave the exhibit because it was members only while we were visibly wearing our membership pins to being yelled at while walking on the stairs to watch our head, weve been through it all.We heard that they museum appointed a Diversity Officer, so on our visit dated Oct 28th, when we experienced discrimination we decided to finally say something.I went up to the membership front desk and explained that I was unhappy and thats why we had decided not to renew our membership. The young woman at the front desk was nice and she said shed like to get a supervisor who had more authority to help.The supervisor was a young white man who took a bad situation and made it worse. When I explained the situation to him he said its the first time Ive ever heard anything like this and  maybe the docents were having a bad day when I visited. At that point, I had had enough of the victim blaming mentality he was displaying and so I told him that it was not acceptable to dismiss overt racism under the guise of bad dayand tried to walk off. He then took an extra aggressive tone with me and asked what more he could do after clearly having done NOTHING except aggravating the situation. I told him as much and we left shortly after.Its amazing how this museum is appropriating the art of other cultures, bemoaning the lack of patronage from the younger generations but then aggressively dissuading minorities from visiting because they doesnt fit their image of who their patrons should be."

Out of 49 people on the bus, 9 of were black. They lumped us all together in 1 group, although we did now know each. But at that time thought, no big deal. We get to the spot and Speedy the tour guide announces that he needs to see our group for something special. That something special ending up being that they wanted all 9 Black people to pay before we even did the excursion, with the other 40 people being told that they could pay afterwards. We fought that, with the help of some other guests on the bus who stood up for us, while dealing with other people being frustrated at us. We still try to do the excursion. We go cave tubing first. My tube deflated and I ended up having to swim, hike, wade in the water with just a life jacket. No other tube was offered or provided. Then we were on the atv, someone in our group ran out of gas  Then at the end. I asked about the food they said they were going to provide. Someone looked at me and said what food. I look at my reservation where it said lunch and pointed to it. We were then reluctanly given a tray with a tamale on it. At this point the bus we ride in on leaves with Speedy telling us it is crowded and the AC was malfuctioning. So we had separate transportation back to the boat. When it came time to pay, I had no problem paying for the Zip line fun atv super short but I felt there should have been somerthing taken off because, I didnt get the full cave tubing experience. Speedy aparantly leaves the bus and our van picks him up on the side of the road. He gets in the car stating that his job was on the line if we dont pay. We tell him we never stated we weren't going to pay but we would only pay for services rendered. Speedy was very disrespectul and condensing to our group. We get back on the boat and 2 girls from the bus asked us what happened. We told them what Speedy said and they looked at us with disbelief. She shared that the bus was partially empty and the AC work. Even more hurtful she shared that Speedy her group ""thats why I wanted them to pay first because now they are not trying to pay"".  It is devastating to have to deal with racism at home, but to think that I have to deal with it while on vacation is heart breaking."

Went on the tour because of the value with the cave tubing,ATV and zipline. Was very easy to find and was told to pay for the Excursion at the end. Out of all of the people on a 55 passenger tour bus only the nine people of color were asked to pay first by Speedy. When questioned why were we being singled out we were given some BS excuse we were also taken off the bus and put on a separate bus and we're told that it was because we were going to move around different from the rest of the people on the tour. In the process of taking the tour my ATV ran out of fuel while I was on the course. Another person that was in our group, her cave tube popped while in the river. She had to swim the whole course in order to get back to shore because they did not have an extra one or some type of plan in case something like this happened in place. We were also told that lunch was included with the tour but at the end of the tour they tried not to serve us lunch. Then when it came time to pay for the Excursion myself who ran out of fuel and the other person whose tube popped we're expected to pay full price for the tour. After arguing with Speedy we came to a resolution for a discounted price due to the mishaps on the course which was fair but he really did not want to do that  and we should not have had to go through all of that because of their in efficiencies. And to add insult to injury some of the non people of color who are on the tour bus that referred us to the tour told us when we got back on our cruise ship that's Speedy told all the non people of color on the bus that that's why he wanted us to pay first and we were the only people not on the bus going back to the terminal! If this is not racism at its finest I don't know what is!!! Not to mention that Speedy is darker than us! Horrible!!! Would not do this tour ever again  even though it had a lot of value to it again people of color beware!"

What I noticed at Calumet though that the door policy seems to be more flexible for white/Europeans... Out of the last few times I tried to get in with male friends, we had absolutely no problem twice with my Nordic friends, but were refused entry every other time when with Asian and local looking friends in a quite distasteful  arrogant manner on the most recent occasion.  In every instance I refer to here, we were a group of 23 males, clearly tourists except for me a local can easily tell a tourist in Armenia, let alone from the language, about the same weekdays and hours. I don't see what else could trigger this difference in their attitude. I am hoping I'm wrong, but guess will never know as not setting foot there again, with girls or without."

He said fine, but as he he saw our group he went on making racial comments on how Indians are cheap and then he said he only has a bed for double the price. When I confronted him on his comments he said he had no beds  and then he physically threatened me. He said what will you do if I said whatever I said. Then he took off his name tag  given the coward he was. Hence I could not get his name. His Supervisor  Peter was standing near and he did not do anything to control the situation.

And I guess to beef up the material, other forms that don't originate in Indonesia, like aerial silk French. It doesn't highlight the dance forms that have been borrowed from other cultures and where they are from so isn't totally authentic in that sense. I liked the Saman dance the most. Then, the racism began. The dancing monkey taught the poacher how to dab, a distinctly AfricanAmerican dance. Then the young Indonesia girl announced she was going to show 'her style' which cued some hip hop choreography. To make sure it was blatant what was being implied, another monkey came out with gold chains around his neck to breakdance on the floor. I thought all of this was in very bad taste. Indonesians are known to call black people monkeys as a racial slur and was surprised to find it in a performance I went to to appreciate Indonesian dance culture. I was left with a sense of WTF. If you would rather not support racist institutions, I'd give this one a miss."

Nevertheless the rest fairly entertaining. Unfortunately, we could understand nothing at all as they all spoke in Russian. What was shocking is the staffs who manages this place. They do not speak English but that wasn't the main problem. They do not respect people at all  particularly Asians. There was no queue to collect coats and everyone practically rushed to the front to get their coats. When we Asians approached the counter, they told us off in Russian which we could barely understand but I guessed they told us to go at the back  which I'm confused why the rest of them were not told off when they were in front without queuing We moved to be back, say about 23 people but many white people went to the front of us and right in front of us without queuing but this lady did not tell them off and allowed them to take their coats  jumping queues. When it was our turn, as she held my shawl, it was dragging the floor and ""sweeping"" it. She threw our coats on the counter and continued to sulk. As I was collecting it  just merely seconds, she told me off in Russian with ""get off"" hand gestures. I was surrounded by so many people who were jumping queues, and I could not leave. She continued to scold us and I had to tell her off in English to WAIT, because I am trying to leave but it was CROWDED!! She kept quiet when I told her off in English. Her attitude was not like that at all to nonAsians.I will suggest everyone to stay off this circus as they support racism. We are all taught not to support racism, but here they welcome racism with open hands."

I appreciated the fact that it is in a history building, and wish they had included that part of the history more with maybe tours of the previously used areas. There is a simulation of slaves being held in cages towards the front, but thy're so close together and one does a lot of singing so it is hard to hear. Once past that, you get into the real heart of the museum, and there's lots of reading to do. I would have appreciated more interactive exhibits versus reading and videos. They do do a great job going over systematic racism and injustices. I was also happy to see them say out loud that 1 there is still racism in the Alabama legislature and; 2 the 80's war on drugs by Reagan was really just an attempt to control and exterminate blacks. The exhibit where you simulated a prison visit was very moving. We listened to the story of a man in his 70's who served more than 40 years in prison, doing hard labor. He was a juvenile when sentenced. Also noting the Prison Rules posted on the side was interesting."

There is a reasonable fee for each, and tickets may be bought on line.  The museum tickets are timed since it is very popular, so it is wise to reserve in advance.  The memorial may be visited at any time during the hours at which it is open.There is a shuttle running around every 20 minutes between the two areas. You can also walk around 20 minutes or drive.  Parking at the museum can be challenging, but there is a parking garage about two blocks away.The memorial was formerly known as the National Lynching Memorial and is a national memorial to commemorate the victims of lynching in the United States. The memorial was constructed and opened in 2018 in order to acknowledge the past of racial terrorism and further the continual search for social justice in America. In the central position is the memorial square with 805 hanging steel rectangles, the size and shape of coffins, representing each of the counties in the United States where a documented lynching took place.  Around this is a reflective area with benches and statuary where people may sit or walk.The Legacy Museum: from Enslavement to Mass Incarceration displays the history of slavery and racism in America. This includes the enslavement of AfricanAmericans, racial lynchings, segregation, and racial bias.  There are displays, storyboards, videos, photographs, and artwork to spent time thinking about.  There is a collection of soil in bottles from lynching sites across the United States on display at the museum and an area with hologram technology to dramatize the horror and terror of enslavement, lynchings, and legalized racial segregation in America. There are first person accounts of slavery and auctioning through narration and voice overs.We spent around three hours here in early March.

The first exhibit is an interactive display of the various types of slaves men, women, children in holding cells and what they would say. The next room houses the rest of the exhibits. It was a little confusing as to how to navigate the floor. You should start to the left but after each ""topic"" is presented turn around to view the supporting displays then return to the next topic along the left wall continuing to zigzag through the room. Along the right wall are smaller sectioned areas that run videos. These are not to be missed. We ran out of time completing the last two. Also very moving are the firsthand letters, quotations, pictures of slaves, the advertisements created to sell the slaves and the Community Remembrance Project resulting in a wall of jars containing dirt from the site where a person was lynched along with their names, location and date of the lynching.

Yet, somehow it creates a sense of reflection and peace to remember them and their useless, tragic deaths. It is a MUST see for all Americans!"

There is a reasonable fee for each, and tickets may be bought on line.  The museum tickets are timed since it is very popular, so it is wise to reserve in advance.  The memorial may be visited at any time during the hours at which it is open.There is a shuttle running around every 20 minutes between the two areas. You can also walk around 20 minutes or drive.  Parking at the museum can be challenging, but there is a parking garage about two blocks away.The memorial was formerly known as the National Lynching Memorial and is a national memorial to commemorate the victims of lynching in the United States. The memorial was constructed and opened in 2018 in order to acknowledge the past of racial terrorism and further the continual search for social justice in America. In the central position is the memorial square with 805 hanging steel rectangles, the size and shape of coffins, representing each of the counties in the United States where a documented lynching took place.  Around this is a reflective area with benches and statuary where people may sit or walk.The Legacy Museum: from Enslavement to Mass Incarceration displays the history of slavery and racism in America. This includes the enslavement of AfricanAmericans, racial lynchings, segregation, and racial bias.  There are displays, storyboards, videos, photographs, and artwork to spent time thinking about.  There is a collection of soil in bottles from lynching sites across the United States on display at the museum and an area with hologram technology to dramatize the horror and terror of enslavement, lynchings, and legalized racial segregation in America. There are first person accounts of slavery and auctioning through narration and voice overs.We spent around three hours here in early March.  If you are in the Montgomery area, you need to visit these sites."

In 1950 african Americans were still being not just segregated and discriminated against, bit were losing their lives due to enforcement of racial laws and public sentiment against black people.

Being a clinical psychologist from up north where there truly is not that much racism I was completely shocked how I entered the gift shop as I was finishing my tour of the park and I was approached by a rather strange heavyweight white lady that was obviously scouting us out. Dirty looks and no greeting.  As we left the store my spouse and I were asked for our receipt of admission!!We were the only ones that were being scouted at and asked for a receipt. I immediately started To show them pictures of the park while my spouse was retrieving the receipt from his wallet. At this point  three white country women were surrounding me and treating us as if we were criminals. I immediately stated that if I were a Caucasian this would not be happening. One of the three miserable women repIied dont use the rascism card. We immediately left the park in shock of what had just happened.  I then contacted customer service at gator world and got the runaround. Obviously the white women at the gift shop already contacted the front desk to tell them what had happened. If you are not white please do not come to this park there is no need for you to be treated as if you were trash. Take it from a clinical psychologist I study human behavior for a living .These sad three women were sad to look at sad to talk to and extremely ignorant. It is very sad that an educated couple such as my spouse and myself should have to be dealing with racism. For the record no one should be dealing with racism. !!!!!!

We decided to speed up our game and play scramble, with no issue.  Another worker came by and said we have to hurry up, we are about 45 minutes behind schedule.  I then looked up and pointed to the people in front of us who were holding us up since we were waiting on them.  No one decided to go over the them and tell them they were taking too long.  Instead the worker told me that he is the golf pro at the country club and he knows when people are taking too long.  At that point, my group was soo annoyed that we went around 56 groups that we in front of us, which meant we skipped 4 holes.  At the end, our group of 4 people took 3 hours to complete 18 holes  normally it would take about 44.5 hours.  I am completely boggled by the situation and will never golf there again.

Normal price for a cappuccino in italy is 1.201.40 but at dot.com is 1.75 The food options are ok but very over priced. Bathrooms at dot.com are horrendous, use the bathroom at Prada or gucci. Almost non existent wifi, impossible to connect and extremely slow.Prada outet it's strange compared to the same in Bicester UK or in the USA. In Leccio if you are Asian, more notable chinese, they are instantly bugged with you and SA's are curt, impatient, and tthe cashier asks to see your passport or ""documento"" before asking for your number under which your items are held for you.  So being Asian from Singapore I was first asked for my passport and the women asked me three times if the two handbags and two wallets are for me. Yet next to me at the next register was an italian woman buying at least a dozen pairs of men's shoes......no asking for a documento, no questions at all. I then observed the cashiers changing demeanors to customers depending on if they were Asian or not. I don't like the way I was treated and I don't appreciate being made to feel like less than a human being simply because I come from asia. I almost despise my purchases becaus they remind me how bad I felt standing there prada.The gucci shop on then other hand was much better and so were the other shops.Also I didn't appreciate these random men in the middle of the road outside the PRADA outet asking for signatures for some drug movement or something. When you politely say no thank you, they keep calling after you and take advantage of the fact that you don't understand them.Other than for my horrible treatment at the prada outet and the horrendous bathroom at the dot.com cafe, it's definitely a must for anyone with the shopping bug."

Next morning, we skipped the aarti and decided to go for a walk. It was 4:30 AM and I noticed only Indian volunteers are engaged in cleaning the temple complex sweeping the streets, gardening, cleaning toilets, cooking and so on. Whereas the whiteskinned people are chanting mantras, maintaining storefront and meditating. On further probing, a boy cleaning the garden said that since they are dark skinned, they are advised to do the daily chores. As devotees prefers watching whiteskinned people performing aarti, chanting/singing Hare Krishna and selling products.Even the security stopped us from entering several roads adjoining the complex. The security personnel indirectly said that they are not allowed to permit Indians enter those roads as those roads leads to residential complex of whiteskinned volunteers and a few of them does not like that.I wanted to visit the temple to rejuvenate myself.

He complied and actually apologized to the man who in turn stated he was too drunk to be there and stated he had to leave.  We had literally been there 1015 minutes and while he had been drinking it was not at all a ""too drunk"" issue.  We decided it was just as well and all packed up to leave while the other man in our group paid for the unused pool table time.  As we were leaving we passed the front door which was an accident and none of us are very familiar with this pool hall at which point the older white man came up and started aggressively talking to the other black man in our party who was 100 sober.  We stated we didn't realized the door was 10 feet back and again apologized and turned to leave to see about 34 more staff members join in a very threatening stance and one of them muttering the N word while pointing at the door! Mind you we are all walking out the door at this point.  We then get into the car to leave and the group of men follow us outside and take a picture of us/our car as we were leaving! Two of us were in there a few weeks back and there was a pretty diverse crowd at the same time of night and on this specific night these were the only two people of color.  Come to find out a few days after this incident the older white man who singled out the black men in our group is the OWNER and had systematically picked on multiple black people earlier in the night claiming they had each violated some crazy rule.  One of our friends had been there previously and was asked to leave at 1am due to him being too loud for a family establishment He was also then followed outside and photographed!  The previous time we'd been there we had a great time with nice staff and a nice casual place to play pool but after this I can guarantee you we won't be back and if the owner continues to discriminate based on race it will not go unnoticed in a city as racially diverse as Burnsville!"

Emmett Till has always haunted me both because his murder was so unspeakably gruesome, but also because it happened about two months before my white mom was born. I dont know how people can say racism is no longer a problem when this was happening as my mother was born and learning about the world. Things that deep dont disappear so suddenly. The museum is run by the son of one of the black men ordered to clean Tills blood out of the murderers truck and is housed in the cotton gin where they took the fan they tied around his neck.  Inside, they have recreated buildings where various events in Till's murder unfolded, and informational plaques walk you through the timeline and aftermath.  There are also historical markers throughout town that mark the murderers' houses or where they once stood and the river bridge where Till's body was discarded.  His story is powerful already, but being where it actually happened makes it so very real."

The tour guide was fantastic.  Death threats made to Medgar Evers changed the way he and his family went about their daily lives but not their resolve to fight segregation, Jim Crow laws, and for voting rights.  He and his family slept with their mattresses on the floor to reduce the likelihood that they could be shot through the windows of their home.  The bullet that killed Medgar Evers after going through him traveled through the front window, through an interior wall and then ricocheted off of the refrigerator see picture of refrigerator.

My son and I are big baseball fans.The museum presents the history of the negro baseball leagues in a fascinating combination of history, memorabilia, photographs and stories.  I knew some of this history and some of the great black players and the museum did a great job of presenting the whole story.I appreciated especially learning about great black players who were as good as and even better than the white players on the rosters of the allwhite teams of the major leagues but never got the attention and acclaim they deserved.  And, learning of the deep, systemic racism within the white major leagues left me with a profound sense of gratitude for the black players and white owners that fought this racism and overcame it.Baseball, today, is the most diverse of the major sports in the United States with players of all skin colors from all over the world.  We have the players of the Negro Leagues who fought for equality and for the opportunity to play in the major leagues."

Sadly, the Red Sox my team was the last to integrate.This museum is thoughtfully arranged with a ton of items on display.  Each item is clearly labeled with informative tags.There are many uniforms, bats, balls etc.  But the best is the ""back stories"" on the players.  These were some of the best players ever.   Most of the white players were clearly not as good.It would have been easy for the museum to harp on the racism and segregation.  The negative truth was not at all hidden, but they focused on the great players.  This enhanced the experience even more.Allow a couple hours to read, appreciate and fully the educational experience the museum offers.Baseball fans will enjoy it, non fans probably not so much.  There were 3 of us.  I am a ardent fan, one person a marginal fan and the 3rd in between.  I could have stayed another hour or two.

This is a great history museum as much as it is a baseball museum.It is in an area of KC that has been redeveloped.  The museum is a part of a complex that also features a Jazz Museum which looked nice, bit we didn't have time to see it.  Maybe next time.And don't forget to go Arthur Bryant's after your visit.

Even the most prestigious London clubs allow these trainers so why doesnt a small time club in Epsom Suspicious...When we asked the security guard if he changed his trainers would he be allowed in we were told noAlso suspicious...The security guard was rude to anyone who tried to reason with him and even brought out another security guard to intimidate my boyfriend who was showing no signs of anger or violence AT ALL! This resulted in him having to go home which is ridiculous. On top of this two other coloured men dressed nicely were refused entry whilst this was happening THIS IS NO LONGER JUST SUSPICIOUS THIS IS PLAIN RACISM.

Then now 3 years later I go out with my friends and man, mind you the bouncer didn't even ask for my ID because he remembered me from 3 years ago that I was coming, let me in with no ID. My man went to go in and was told his dress code wasn't right. Which every man in the place had the same thing on my man did. Hat, tee shirt, jeans and sneakers.

You will hear the voice of injustice, you will hear their cry, you will have to face your own prejudice and be challenged to process what next  Where do I go from here  What voice am I meant to haveParking is free in the parking lot which is also patrolled by security.  You will initially see the Lorraine Motel which looks like it is stuck in time and did not keep up with modernization.  The Motel is the site of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.  The museum itself takes you through the story of African Americans and the injustice that has taken place from the early slave trade through to the present.It takes 23 hours to make it through museum...give it the time needed rather than rushing through it and truly being able to hear the voices and be challenged by what it represents.Cost is 16 for adults note, they are closed on Tuesdays.  At first you can enter into an art gallery, no photos in this area.The rest of the museum is a selfguided tour.  There is a lot of reading so be prepared to take your time.  Although this is good for kids to learn about, much of the information may go over their heads due to the larger amounts of reading in each exhibit. Be ready to explain what is going on and help put things into a language that they will explain and understand.  It is ideal for teens and adults as they shape their understanding around justice and peace.  There are a lot of physical elements that you can also interact with displays like buses, a dining area, statues of protestors.  Each room covers a different theme or element of racism towards African Americans.  The first room starts with information regarding the slave trade from 1619  1861.  They were viewed as a commodity to be traded and taken advantage of.  In the first room, you can also wait to see a special film which shows every 20 minutes.  Once you are done, you will proceed through to the next room of the museum.The museum continues through 16 different exhibit areas.  The journey addresses slavery and Civil War.  It then proceeds to the segregation that African Americans experienced and the fight they went through to be recognized as equals.  This took place through the sit ins, the freedom riders, bus boycotts, children stepping forward, marches and strikes.  All the while, they were met with opposition from groups like the KKK, attacked by dogs, shot with water cannons and their churches were burned.The museum brings to light several movements that came forward to try to stop the injustice: the Black Panthers and NAACP.  Several voices emerged as leaders, many of them within churches.  Much of the movements against the hatred and racism were met without fighting back and using strategic protesting to make their point heard.   Martin Luther King Jrs last speech can be seen before you step into his final moments in room 306 and 307 before he was assassinated.After your time at the museum, you may want to go and sit in a coffee shop, talk about what you saw and continue to hear.  Process in groups as you figure out what your own life steps may be going forward.  If you have the chance, head to Birminghams Kelly Ingram park which is the site of many of the injustices discussed in the museum.  The physical location adds another layer of wrestling with this as you stand at one of the other Ground Zero locations of the racism."

This museum takes you on an emotional journey through history covering everything from slavery to modern America.  Often very harrowing and emotional you are given a greater understating of the challenges black people encountered in America.  How institutional racism held them down, gave them little or no say in their lives and oppressed their speech and liberties.  How strong people stood up, were counted and began to make a difference and how some of which tragically died for that cause.  What a fantastic venue this is and an amazing monument to the work of legendary black Americans who sacrificed so much to bring freedom, equality and fairness to black American men and women.  It leaves you with you heart broken for the misery and suffering that was delivered to the poor black communities of America and how oppression forced them into lives of horror and pain.  While you are touched by the successes of the few you are reminded that people still picket the streets of America with placards campaigning for change and their rights to be upheld. Black people are a third more likely to be pulled over while driving and are 2 and half more times likely to be killed by a police officer.  45 of Black children under the age of 6 live in abject poverty where parents are having to choose when to feed themselves and their children.

MLK was one of my heroes growing up, and I recall being more upset about his death than RFK...with the tensions that are growing in this country today, it is obvious that our country lost more than a great man when an assassins bullet ended his life...we lost one of the greatest moral compasses we've ever had...not blacks...not whites...not any ethnic or racial group...ALL OF AMERICA. The Museum progresses through the history of black American from the African slave trade to Colonial America through today. At several points it impacted me so heavily that I just wanted to find a quiet place to cry and mourn...for the pain that racism caused...for the escalating signs of racism today...for the fact that we were on the verge of something that was going to heal our country...and that MLK's death impacted the momentum that was building throughout America.

But misnamed,"Approaching this facility from the parking lot, I was strruck with a sense of heaviness. There on the balcony of the preserved Lorraine Motel is a wreath marking the spot where Martin Luther King was murdered, I don't use the term ""hallowed ground"" lightly but that's what it felt like to meand should the experience be rendered a conflict by other visitors who seemed to think it was an amusement parkSo we entered the museumand I was struck that it was not really a civil rights museum. That's not entirely a criticism; it's primarily a monument to Dr, King, and as such it's entirely fitting and proper to have on this site. But as a civil rights museumwell, it focuses only on the rights of African Americans save for a short video about the Polaris project that's combating world slavery, Don't civil rights also extend to Native Americans, Hispanics, and other oppressed groupsIt also failed for me as a museum. When I visit a museum I'm expecting to browse through galleries and learn things at my own pace and according to my own interests. Here, I was essentially herded through exhibitsmost of which told me nothing I didn't already know, I don't need to see the 12minute video that reviews the Civil War, Emancipation Proclamation, amendments 13, 14 and 15, Dred Scott, Plessy, etc. Perhaps most of the visitors doande then after, we're marched through corridors cataloguing the history of the civil rights movement in excruciating detail. Some of it was great for methe Rosa Parks bus, the burnedout Greyhound from the Freedom Riders, the simulation of the Edmund Pettus bridge, seeing into the actual rooms that King occupied before his deathbut so much was just a repeat of what I saw in the news 50 years ago. A museum that's mostly test on the wall is perhaps better published as a bookAnd againas a tribute to King, it's great. But for civil rights in general, it gives short shrift to many While I didn't read every word in the museum, I noted only 2 references each for Medgar Evers, Malcolm, X, Elijah Muhammed I didn't see Bobby Seale anywhere, Muhammed Ali gets one mention in the ""black arts and culture"" corridor GilScott Heron gets 2, not that I think he doesn't deserve them. Barbara Jordannowhere.Perhaps my discomfort is fueled in part by the sick feeling I got from revisiting so much of the racism that was endemic in the America of my youth. HoweverI've been to the national AfroAmerican Cultural Center and Museum in Wilberforce, Ohio. It's a facility that is true to its namea full range of African American culture, presented in a museum format rather than as a forced march. I'd like for this location to learn something from them."

I think if Dr. MLK Jr. was alive he would be disappointed with the curator. At the very first room of the museum was that very well done informative exposition, but with an enormous bias that tries to input all fault of the slave trade to the ""evil"" Europeans who stimulates the tribal rivalities as they aren't there for years and years before the arrival of them. So, you go to a movie theater to see a propaganda movie w/ misleading information that minimizes the major discussion that happened between the founding fathers about slavery Benjamin Franklin was ouvertly against the slavery and the ""Slavery Question"" was kept open on the declaration of independence to be further solved, in pro to keep the union of the 13 colonies against England. Other misleading information was the emancipation proclamation did by Lincon. At the movie, the narrator minimizes it to a mere ""strategic war act"" from the north to destabilize the southern economy. Those are the most crying faults of the movie, but they were not the only ones.It is also interesting that there is no information that science has a long time refuted the concept of race in humans. Instead, the museum speech gives strength to this error. However, the museum collection is rich in photos and other audiovisual sources. The most emotional part to me was the ""I have a dream"" room. Hear the speech gave me goosebumps. I loved the Rose Parks room with the bus and the audio inside, it made me feel uncomfortable as it should be. The second part of the museum across the street showed no bias and I love when I heard at the final movie that the opposite of love isn't hate but, indifference.I noticed that was no whites working at the museum, I don't know if it was an unfortunate coincidence.At the end, I was in doubt if I should buy any merchandise to the gift shop and support that vision.Summarizing: The goal to promote tolerance was a far way to be reached, the message of integration as Dr. MLK jr. wanted was not at the aim of exposition."

I have yet to hear back from them. To whom it may concern,I am a 4th and 5th grade public school teacher who visited your museum this summer.  I would like to write to you today to share some of my thoughts about my experience while attending this museum with friends this summer. To begin, there were several great things I took away from this experience.  The constant moving around the museum, as well as the tactile experiences of reenacting the tea being thrown into the harbor, were really engaging experiences.  I attended this museum with an 8 year old, and he loved this part of it.  I also really appreciated how the museum laid out the chain of events that occured after the tea party.  Within the context provided by the museum experience, it was clear to participants the importance and incredible risk this act posed during Colonial times for those involved.  Although there were things I enjoyed about the museum experience, two things deeply bothered me. The first was the fact that as participants in the museum, we were given feathers, so that if need be, we could disguise ourselves as Mohawk Indians.  I know that this is a historically accurate representation of this event, and I understand that a major purpose of this museum experience is to reenact, with as many layers of authenticity as possible, the events that took place in Boston Harbor that night.  That being said, we do not live in a vacuum.  We live in a broader historical context.  It is 2018.  I can see no way to justify having an audience made up of people living in the year of 2018 reenact the racism of the past.  I did talk to my tour guide about this, and this guide did say that the disguise at the time was not meant to offend or disrespect the Mohawk tribe. She also said that none of the colonists had ever met a member of the Mohawk tribe before deciding to dress in this costume with a feather.  She said they chose to use the feathers because it was an important symbol to the tribe.  I would like to know more about your sources for this information, because I am skeptical of it.  If indeed the colonists were not intending to disrespect the Mohawk Tribe with their disguise  which I find hard to believe, considering the tense and bad relationship that existed at that time between colonists and Native Americans  it is still a racist act, even considering the context of 1773.  Even more so, in 2018, this act is incredibly racist.  Other visitors of the museum were wearing their feathers in their hair during the tour.  How would a person of Native descent feel about experiencing this part of the museum How is it ok to let people engage in a racist act  wearing feathers in an attempt to look like a Native American  so that they can ""better experience"" the event of the Boston tea party It is not ok, and it misinforms the public.  People could very easily leave this experience feeling that it is ok to make light of both this treatment towards and false representation of Native Americans.  The second topic I was bothered by was a topic completely left out of the whole museum experience  the topic of slavery.  How can a museum about Colonial America fail to include the topic of slavery I understand that slavery was different in the Northern colonies compared to the Southern colonies.  However, it was an essential part of Colonial America.  You cannot understand Colonial America without considering it as a whole, and slavery is too huge a piece to leave out.  It may be an uncomfortable topic to discuss, especially considering how the colonists were comparing themselves as slaves to Britain during this time this was a quote I heard during my museum experience, but it is a necessary topic to include.  Omitting it not only blatantly misinforms the public, but also wastes an opportunity to explore some of the unpleasant and contradictory truths about the American fight for independence from Britain.  I write this to you because we can do better. We must do better.  As a museum intended to educate the public, these two points I raised are highly problematic and must be taken into consideration.  I write this as an educator, but also as a person who attended this museum with people of color, and specifically a young person of color.  How do you think he felt about this museum experience How do you think other people of color would feel If we continue to perpetuate misperceptions about groups of people, specifically groups of people of color, racism and ignorance will also be perpetuated.  As educators, it is our duty to address racism and ignorance.  Your museum experience perpetuated this. I write this to you in hopes that you will take my criticism seriously so that you can improve your museum experience for all potential museum visitors."

I would not suggest going out of your way to visit, nor would I put it on the list of mustsee  museums in New York, but it is definitely worth one hour if you are nearby or if you plan to spend time in Chinatown and perhaps have a good meal in the area.The museum is small but nicely laid out and good on the atmospherics, using the old building in which it is located to good visual effect. The temporary exhibitions, especially the one about Chinese typewriters, were particularly interesting.We were lucky enough to be guided around by one of the museum volunteers. If you are offered such a guided tour you should certainly accept the offer as it will enhance your visit.The museum tells the experience of the Chinese in America very well. It is a powerful story that frankly should embarrass and shame white Americans I am one, with unfortunately true illustrations of truly horrible racism that persisted from the eighteenth century until long into the twentieth century. I don't think the material and the displays are intended only for that purpose, but they do reflect the unpleasant history of the Chinese experience in America. With that said, the general tone is uplifting and the exhibits interesting even when shocking."

The permanent exhibit takes you through the history of the Chinese people and influence in America. It is both illuminating and frustrating in showing the racism and xenophobia Chinese people faced when coming to America. With the current tone of our politics reflecting the same animus that greeted Chinese folks in the past this history is vital. The exhibit explicitly discusses how the struggle for a just society has been composed of all marginalized folks organizing together and it is a lesson that we would do well to carry into the future.There is also an exhibit on Chinese medicine in America that is great. This exhibit isn't permanent so you have to catch it before it leaves. They do a great job in discussing the false dichotomy between what we call ""western medicine"" and Chinese medicine. This exhibit also has great visual appeal as well as primary source material that is a wonder to look at. The artwork in the exhibit is evocative and really does seem to visualize the concept of qi. Learning the roots of Chinese medicine and seeing the latest developments in its practice has made me more curious about it and determined to explore more.The other traveling exhibit is a recreation of the Kam Wah Chung  Co. General Store. In this exhibit, you step into what the store itself looked like during the gold rush. You also learn about the business savvy and medical practice of the store owners. It does an excellent job of telling you how people who were barred from participating in just about every part of the economy and society were able to create a place for themselves and contribute to the health, wealth, and culture of the nation even while they were under racist restrictions.The gift shop also has some sweet merch and good books.

It spoke about a nonviolent movement, but the exhibits and guided tour aroused in me violent feelings of injustice.  In that sense, the effects of the museum were ironic.  The museums approach to the telling of stories was brute and lacked a gentle and compassionate viewpoint and approach.  There appeared to be no recorded firsthand accounts from the black or white middle class or black or white protesters at the events covered. For example, note the four who started the Woolworths sitin in 1960 in Greensboro:  there was a dramatic reenacting on video and a life size dioramaan account of a second hand account.  Instead, I would have loved to hear audio or video recordings of what middle class black and white people saw and thought at the time of the happenings: for example, recordings of people alive now that were at the front lines and of how they felt. There appeared to be none of that.   The approach of this museum is very similar to how mainstream historical societies or museums tell mainly one side of the race storywhen they do not talk about or they gloss over the plight of African Americans and African American slaves their descendants.  Similarly, this museum does the same thing from the opposite end of the spectrum and does not tell about the opposing views, especially the nuanced views of the antagonist or adversary.  Thus, this contained a predominantly one sided display about race relations.  The result of the museum was a classic race baiting. The museum generated a sense of fear and anger more than it bridged any understanding between the races.  Also, the museum simplified things when it was much deeper and complicated than that because there are many gray areas in the issues of relations between blacks and whites. The museum displayed the appalling outcomes of race relations by showing television news video snippets, pictures of brutal occurrences and protesters, displays of newspaper articles and classified ads.  Displays were on angular signs, in dimly lit and in relatively narrow halls, further evoking a sense of adversity, fear, anger perhaps even rage to the museum visitor. As examples, it showed the actual Woolworth lunch counter which took up about 3,000 square of space in the museum which seemed to take up a lot of physical space. Also, there was a display of a police baton and a Ku Klux Klan outfit.  These type of displays served as icons for the oppression of colored peoples, namely blacks.   However, the museum didnt elaborate about the not as sensational and television newsworthy day to day experiences of how the middle class whites and blacks felt, which probably needed their implicit approval or disapproval, or lack of direct inquiry or research in order for the race relations status quo to get worse or stay the same. For example, how did middle class blacks and whites feel about the insidious effects on both blacks and whites of white flight, panic peddling, block clubs, blockbusting, mandatory busing, mandatory desegregation and white loss  How did the people who didnt attend protests and who didnt display mob behaviors feel Furthermore, how did middle class white people feel when the police that normally patrolled their neighborhood went to patrol areas where blacks were moving into white areas  How did middle class white people feel when desegregation and bussing was forced verse when desegregation in schools and bussing were optional How did middle class black people feel to have moved into a white neighborhood and find dozens of white protesters in front of his house and telling him to move  How did middle class black people feel when police officers came to protect the white protesters verses protect the middle class black person from the white people as exemplified in the Calumet Park Riot of 1957The museum didnt appear to denote the nuances and differences of institutionalized racism, civil rights movement and racism in general. For example, the docent said people that were not white were considered colored, but it did not say many colored people were mistaken for white people on public transportation. As another example, it was really confusing to see an image of Mohammed Ali when he didnt support civil rights movement or its agenda at all, around 1971.  This museum does a disservice to enhancing the race relations discussion; however, this museum is a great instrument of race baiting.  And for that alone, it is worth visiting to see how the masses are educated to be distrustful of the other race.Other means the other race that one is not part of.  For example, if you are black the other race is white.  If you are white, the other race is black.  If you are mixed race, the other race is white."

Yet my tour of the museum opened my eyes in unexpected ways. It was literally a lifechanging experience.The museum is beautifully laid out and the exhibits are incredible, blending multimedia with traditional displays. The tours are all guided, and our guide Jeanne was an incredible storyteller. She explained the details of some of the more horrifying moments of racism and oppression with compassion but without pulling any punches. I found myself frequently moved to tears, yet by the time the tour ended, I left full of hope and determination to continue the important work of those Civil Rights leaders who started this important fight for equity. I recommend this museum as a must see if you're in the Greensboro area."

Clear evidence that the 'plantation' mentality STILL reigns in Greensboro and throughout Guilford County, NC. I see this as a clear message to the black community to let them know who is STILL in charge. Nothing good has ever happened in Guilford County... 'Greensboro Massacre', corruption in law enforcement and even during the turn of the century, favorite son O. Henry left Greensboro in disgust over the racism he witnessed.With that said, the museum remains a tribute to 4 young American heroes that stuck it to the plantation owners and their antiAmerican way of life."

You proceed through the museum with a guide and cannot take a selfguided tour.  The general areas/themes are: 1 the famous 1960 Greensboro lunch counter sit in; 2 the ""look"" of racism and segregation in the US in transportation, education, public accomodations, etc; 3 a brief overview of key events in the struggle for civil rights.  A fourth area just one room quickly touched on civil rights struggles in other countries.For me, there were two high points.  The first was being able to see the actual lunch counter where this seminal event took place the museum is located in the actual Woolworths store.  The other was an interactive display of the hundreds of lunch counter sit ins that occurred throughout the Southeast within only two months of the Greenboro sit in.  Without email, texting, Facebook, etc. this movement spread rapidly and this is shown through a compelling interactive map.At the same time, I gave this museum average ratings for several reasons.1.  Because you must see the museum on a tour, the tour is greatly influenced by the quality of the guide.  Our guide tended to go through the information in a monotone and very quickly.  Also, you  must go through at the pace of the tour.2.  Assuming you were given time to explore, there is not that much to explore.  While the museum can be useful for someone new to the topic who wants a brief overview, there is little for someone who wants additional information.3.  To describe this museum as ""international"" is a bit of a stretch despite the brief info on other civil rights struggles in other parts of the world.This museum would be good for school groups even though some images are extremely distrurbing and graphic and teachers/parents should be given a ""heads up"" and those wanting a cursory introduction to the topic.  For me, having seen the much more in depth civil rights museum in Memphis, TN, this was mildly interesting, mainly because it provided some depth on the Greensboro sit ins.The tour lasts an hour and, unless you like gift shops, this is a 90 minute visit tops.  It is also nice to stroll Elm Street in downtown Greensboro to look at the art deco buildngs and other architecture."

I remember the news coverage, but at the time New Orleans felt impossibly far away, and I'm not sure, even as an adult, that I ever really appreciated the extent of the damage. And although I knew that it was mostly workingclass, black residents who'd been the worst hit, and that police racism had been a feature of the aftermath, I didn't know the extent. It made me very angry.The area is pretty easy to get to  you can walk, if you're up for it, through Bywater and over the bridge. Or you can get the bus, which I did. The neighbourhood still shows signs of the damage done by Katrina  it was very quiet when I visited, with plots of land notably empty. The museum itself is easy to find, and I was the only visitor when I arrived. The lady on the desk was very nice  she left me to look around, and took a long time to answer my questions afterwards.There've been one or two comments about whether this museum encourages disaster tourism. It's always a bit of an ethical dilemma, and I confess to feeling slightly uncomfortable as a foreigner visiting an area devastated by Katrina in order to try to understand something that really, I don't think I'll ever be able to.  However, I thought the museum got it spot on. It's not sensationalistic, and I thought the sections on the long history of the neighbourhood as a distinct, culturally vibrant centre for AfricanAmerican residents was a necessary counterbalance to the sections on the damage done by Katrina and the ongoing struggle to rebuild the neighbourhood. By emphasising the amount of community pride in the area, the museum avoids propagating a onedimensional stereotype of a ruined, dangerous neighbourhood, and I thought the balance between acknowledging the damage done and the positive sides of the neighbourhood was very sensitively handled. The most shocking thing was the racism. The police shootings, and the white residents of Algiers Point who took it upon themselves to shoot black people seeking refuge. It was heartbreaking and a very welcome reminder to anyone who thinks that racism is dead and buried. I also visited the Presbytere, because I was intrigued to see whether this history would be acknowledged in a more official exhibition. Bar one small section, it wasn't  which speaks volumes. "

The museum is a grassroots endeavor and serves as a community center in addition to a museum.  The museum is staffed entirely with private donations museum is free, but donations welcomed and apparently was developed by college professors who donated a portion of their salaries to create the museum. We came here with our children teens and preteens and it sparked many conversations about race, politics, justice, equality, etc. I highly recommend this museum for families who are coming to NOLA, even though it is not a traditional stop on the family tourist route. After the museum, we toured the homes in the area that were designed through the Make It Right Foundation see their website for selfguided tour and were very impressed by the architecture and attention to environmentally sustainable design.

The museum is divided in three areas: the lower floor hosts temporary exhibitions. The first and main floor concentrates on the fights for Civil Rights by AfricanAmericans and segregation and racism over the past decades, after slavery was abolished and the civil war was over.The most emotional part is doubtless the counter lunch: You sit at the counter, wear headphones, and close your eyes. You are now a black person in a bar and are emotionally and physically harassed by people who want you to leave. They spit on you kick you chair and shout at you. How long will you last Then youre ushered to an allwhite room with stories of the Washington march for civil rights, yes, when MLK made his renowned I have a dream speech. And you go on learning about segregation at school, on buses remember the Montgomery bus boycott, at work and before the law. Its interesting and heartwrenching.The upper level is more generally about human rights violation, of course not sufficient to cover all aspect: discrimination against women and mutilation, war and dictatorship and terror, freedom of speech, freedom of sexual orientation, and so on.

The 3rd floor exhibits, primarily focussed on human rights struggles through history and across the globe.

If anything, the exhibits overcompensate in trying to be objective, playing down just how awful segregation and racism have been.

I was there four about 2 and 1/2 hours.The in depth way the Civil Rights Movement was presented was moving; including the timeline progression from separate but equal to civil unrest, the March on Washington, to the struggle culminating with federal desegregation and the pushback from those bigoted individuals in some states against the federal mandate. I loved that it had a talking tour that you can borrow from the guest services office in exchange for your driver license, which they return to you when you return the device I guess a lot of people don't ask for it, I think I was the only one who had one while I was there; it was really helpful in explaining the items contained within as well as the background behind the design of the exhibits to achieve a desired effect. I think they should update the tour device to allow the listener to stop, pause and rewind a particular section and that they should advertise it so that more people know about it. The lunch counter experience was intense. I did notice that some of the headsets were not working, but when I found one that did, I was able to get the full effect of probably just a fraction of the vile and hateful things those individuals who took part in the sitins experienced. I wanted to cry just knowing that all those brave individuals went through some of the most horrible things another human can do to another to allow me the freedom today to go about my life with little to no overt racism being experienced. It really caused me to check myself for taking these freedoms for granted that were not allowed to someone of my race less than 70 years ago in this country. While the museum did discuss the current human and civil rights battles taking place throughout the world, I was disappointed to not see any reference to the current racial tension in America including the murders of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown Jr., to name a few of the wellknown cases, by those individuals who have sworn to protect and to serve the citizens of their respective parishes police officers. Do I believe that today in any way resembles the Civil Rights era, no, but I do believe there seems to be a general devaluing of human life by America in general and a devaluing of the lives of people of color by law enforcement specifically. This should be touched on in a ""Center for Civil and Human Rights"" museum as the human rights of citizens to live without fear of death by a person who is only separated from you or I by a uniform it's a job, say, like a sanitation worker are infringed upon time and time again with little to no recourse.

This part is very good. I was a bit disappointed about the more golbal and international part on human and civil rights. That was a bit superficial and skin deep. For exampe there is a world wide map on human rights dividing the world into three catagories: The good guys USA and most European countries, The bad guys Russia, Cuba, China, North Korea,... and those in between Malaysia, Thailand, Zambia,.... A country manipulating elections through gerrymandaring should maybe not pick on others!But the center is certainly worth a visit."

The history of the civil rights movement and the impact of activists, particularly Martin Luther King Jr., is told using actual tv news footage, photographs, voices of those at the forefront and powerful experiences including an opportunity to feel what it was like for Black people to sit at a lunch counter while being verbally attacked and threatened by hatemongers. Exhibits are exceptionally well done, sobering and emotional. The Human Rights sections upstairs expands the lessons beyond race and outside America. I hope Blacks and Whites and people of all cultures will come here. Not for very young children. Best for ages 10 and up. It stimulated great conversation in our family."

We took our granddaughters of 12 and 9 because we knew they would love the costumes and we wanted them to learn about the remarkable woman who wore them.  Her story covers not only the world of entertainment but also her struggle for equal rights and antiracism around the world, and her contribution to the Resistance in WW2.  The girls were fascinated.  Unfortunately, my headset stopped working half way around the tour and I could not find anyone in the Chateau to exchange it.  The girls also loved the opportunity to go inside the aviary and feed the birds. We would have loved to go inside the other aviary with beautifully coloured budgerigars but could not wait until the afternoon show.  The gardens seem to have been extended since our last visit and are much appreciated, especially the water features on a hot day.We had lunch in the Brasserie and although we had to wait a short while for a table, we found the servers to be polite, friendly and ultraefficient."

She has been called 'the Beyonce of her era'...but she was also offered the nominal leadership of the US Civil Rights movement by Martin Luther King's widow after his assassination.And it's a really beautiful place, with a thoughtful exhibition and useful audio guide telling her story in the pintsized chateau and a genuinely lovely partformal garden surrounding it which is clearly still getting attention from contemporary designers.  A nice little brasserie for lunch is tucked away in the outbuildings and a slightly random, but very engaging falconry display was also on offer 95 described in French only...there were a lot of nonFrench speaking visitors there and they might want to offer a bit more to us!My only small niggle The gift shop through which you inevitably exit in the Chateau is just not great. Mostly just generic Dordogne tourist tat, with just a small area offering materials about Josephine herself and a small selection of posters.

Unlike many chateaux, Les Millandes felt very much a family home, and the echo of the presence of her many adopted children permeated the upper levels of the chateau.A mustsee in the Dordogne!"

The quad bikes are easy to operate  even for someone like myself who has never ridden a motorcycle or a quad bike before. It took me two minutes to master the controls, and the quick tutorial was friendly and helpful. The historic and geological aspects of the tour were interesting, and the scenery, as one would expect in this part of the Eastern Free State, was breathtaking.Unfortunately, during one of the stops, our tour guide Mauritz  who wears the FGASA badge was describing different kinds of rock to us and decided it would be appropriate to ask us, as a ""joke"", whether the ""darkies ever think about the rocks they throw."" There was some embarrassed laughter from members of another party from Gauteng. I was stunned. My mates and I didn't respond, in the moment. Later, after a stop at an historic graveyard on the farm, he said loudly, within earshot of the whole group which included children: ""Ek weet nie wat gaan die kaffirs hiermee maak nie  dit trakteer hulle nie""  ""I don't know what the kaffirs are going to do with this  it's not a treat to them.""He made reference to the hope that the family would win the lottery so that they could buy the farm...I can only assume that they are leasing the farm, or that the farm is subject to a land claim or similar. In any case, I came for a tour. I did not come to have bigotry and racism inflicted on me. I was on holiday, and wanted to enjoy my day, or I'd have been tempted to confront the owners and guide when we got back to the farm. This kind of behaviour is unacceptable  frankly I'm gobsmacked. If you take this tour, you'll enjoy the ride, the scenery and some of the factual content  but brace yourself for the racism."

Please read through the whole story.,"Four of us visited the famous Desert Heart Winery on 03Jan around 3:30pm. We are amazed about the exclusively exquisite wines from this winery and was planning to purchase few good bottles back.  Unfortunately we were totally gutted about our tasting experience which left us with no choice to leave the winery with empty hand.1.Firstly, we were served with a glass of white wine. I politely asked the Cellar Door lady if that's ok for me to read through the label at the back of the bottle so that I would know more about the background of this wine. I am not joking she gave me an annoyed face  an eye roll and said to me ""There's nothing written on the back of the bottle, you should read the menu provided onsite."" I do not understand whats the problem for me to read through the description at the back of the bottle If the label wasnt set for customers to read so whats the point for putting a label on the bottle2.During the tasting, weve made some comments about 2 of the red wines. At some point the Cellar Door lady revealed to us that she is the wine maker and warned us to be careful when making our comments of her wines. I said to her wine is something personal and please dont be offend, our friends were just chatting about how they feel but not criticising anyone or anything. If a winemaker cannot take any feedback from the customers, what makes her a good winemaker Not to mention we werent saying something bad, all we were saying is which one we like the most because of the characteristic3.Few minutes later, one of my friends came out from the ladies' room and wanted to express her fondness for the wine logo design. Unexpectedly the Cellar Door Lady said to my friend, "" Yeah, but I dont want to see my wines to be sold in China. This is Racism. I could not believe its still happening in 2019 this generation with all high educated people around! Of course we are a group from different countries of Asia, Hong Kong, China, Malaysia and Singapore, most of us have been living in New Zealand over 5 years. The goal of this road trip is to bring 3 of our WSET students Award in Wines  Spirits Level 2 to understand more about Central Otagos wine but turned out it was a disaster. We do not accept this kind of behavior, with someone trying to criticize us just because we are not a New Zealander. It's offputting to see a cellar door lady who was not appreciated of Asians visit. This is racism, discrimination which should not be happened in a democratic country, NEW ZEALAND.Before posting this review on Tripadvisor, I have contacted Desert Heart wines@desertheart.co.nz to ask for a feedback as I want to give them the benefit of doubt. It could be a miscommunication or what I am not sure. Unfortunately, theres no response until now so I would like to warn all the Asian Travelers, have a second thought before paying a visit to this Winery. You do not deserve to be treated differently because of your colour of skin or speak in a different language ironically, we all spoke in English during the tasting experience. There are a lot of famous Wineries in Bannockburn with customer services oriented  knowledgeable staffs, such as Mt. Difficulties, Terra Sancta, Felton Road. I see no reason to visit a place with nonsense criticism which could possibly ruin your day. Totally not worth it."

I couldn't get in. Why Because I was with an Indian friend. Yes. Because I was with an Indian friend. Six people total. Two were admitted first paying of course the entrance fee. The next two were my Indian friend and I; I had the cash out to pay for the both of us. We were rejected. I don't speak Thai so at first did not understand why. Then my Indian friend only him was pulled aside discretely and no less reprehensibly and told that he must go to the toilet to wash because of a ""bad smell"". I had to convince my friend that these absolute pieces of trash were in fact being racist. This determination of foul odor was made on a basis of sight, unequivocally, as I was the one who approached the cashier, not him. I confronted the doorman about this by asking directly ""do I smell good enough to get in""; to which he responded directly ""yes you are no problem."" My Indian friend then confronted him by asking ""why do you have a problem with me""; to which he responded ""I cannot speak to you."" Yes folks, I wish I was making this up. I spent a good while staring at the door staff in disbelief and shaking my head in disgust, hoping they would be able to realize how toxic they are as human beings, as well as how absolutely morally repugnant their employers are  yes YOU MIXX. Unlike many of my friends and colleagues, I am not so optimistic about the nature of other human beings. However, I find that this often plays in my favor as I am usually more pleasantly surprised by acts of humanity and benevolence. Even with my low standards of the human experience, this takes the cake. It's absolutely sickening and I hope that anyone involved will not be able to sleep at night on account of their own toxic miasma that they bring to this planet. As a cynic, I know that they WILL sleep well, making the commission on all the beautiful and perfect smelling people they do let in. So please Mixx, if you actually give a damn about other human beings like yourselves, you will know to fire immediately those working at your door between 2 and 3 AM early September 8 2018 3 females, 1 male, approximately. Failing that, you can go ahead and extinguish yourself from this already foul planet. Don't be a part of this garbage that turns human freaking beings against one another.

A few Korean places.  At least two black clubs and a handful of Indian clubs.I can't go in those clubs.So I don't try.  I go to the clubs where I AM welcome.At the end of the day, the club owners want a club with a mixture of races, not one that's predominately white, Indian or black.  That's what they have achieved.And the fact that it's full every night indicates that their system is working.I look forward to their continued success and will be back there again next week."

We called Mixx to check if we could come in and made our way there.  The minute we walked down the stairs and towards the club the bouncers started screaming out ..no entry...entry for members only! We said we'd called and checked but they were just snubbing us off. They then had the head bouncer come towards us and he stretched his hands out to start pushing us out. they were laughing and extremely arrogant. We've been to clubs all over the world but to have a club in asia racist towards Indians is one of the most digusting things we'v ever experienced. It was humiliating and a shame on thailand tourism. Dont ever go there.

We were ready to pay any amount for entry but still they didn't budge anf we saw few white people going inside by paying only 100 bahts. They are racist towards Asians. I will strongly suggest not to go to this racist place with worst and rude management

The security at the entrance is instructed not to allow asian and Indians in the club unless you are a vip. Therefore 3 out of the 5 of us weren't allowed entire just because of the colour of our skin while we saw many white people walk in freely without any restrictions. Maybe the management need to wake up and come to terms that we are living in the 21st century and not the 18th century colonial era.  Disgusted to see something like this being practiced in a tourist friendly country like Thailand. Biggest shock and disappointment of our whole trip."

It's awesome.  If ur cheap or ugly don't bother going at all. Unlike what people say they are not racist at all I was just there last sat and saw multi Indians and blacks but they looked good. So they are not racist they just want the rich and handsome Inside the club which is amazing. I wish North American clubs would follow this tactic so we see more beautiful people when we go clubbing instead of ugly smelly dudes.  Thank you mixx I will be back again !

Previous to this the people of Bangkok to us were warm and friendly. MIXX is a different story altogether.When we got to one entrance  the hostess gave us a look up and down and told us that this is a VIP only section and we should go to the other entrance. This is when alarm bells started ringing because as far as I know from partying all over the world, VIP sections only mean paying a lot more for space, comfort and bottle service. So my question is why did she not volunteer the information on what the VIP section was all aboutAnyway we humbly made our way to the next section where we were again denied entrance. The rather rude hostess on this side said that the club only admits regulars. WHAT That is the most illogical excuses that I have ever heard in my life. Ask yourself, to become a regular don't you have to start by entering the club at least once Utter nonsense.My friends once hearing this excuse got quite agitated and started noticing that something was clearly wrong. It was not a matter of dress code as we saw client upon client who were rather underdressed in our opinion being admitted in.When we demanded a clear explanation the hostess then changed her mind and said that the club was totally full and could not admit any more people in. So were the people we were seeing walking in GhostsI am not one to pull out the race card or the ""is it because I am black card"" but after reading the reviews on this place and experiencing it myself it is clear that MIXX has certain prejudice issues which they hide under ""Management Reserves the rights for Admission"".MIXX is clearly a place that will judge you by the color of your skin as there is no other explanation whatsoever as to why certain people cannot be let in. Its 2016 for Gods sake and for the first time in my life and travels across the world, it took a visit to MIXX to let me know that in some sectors of the world racism is alive and kicking.My friends and I eventually decided to keep calm and walk away knowing that if that was how we were going to be treated on the outside who knows what could have happened if we went inside.Oh and by the way...we happen to be very big spenders when we go clubbing wherever we are in the world, glad that we took our money somewhere else where we are appreciated."

However, whenever I have gone with friends who are darker skinned than myself, I have been told the club is full despite tons of white people being let in.I have come to the conclusion that it is no use complaining about it on Trip Advisor and other sites, and so I now refuse to give my custom to any hotel, restaurant and event related to the Intercontinental and Holiday Innowning IHG that hosts these clubs at their premises, which means that they are fostering this racist door policy."

I went there with my wife, I was allowed access without any issue, like other previous guests has commented that the staff is racist, I didn't find any racism. dark and dingy place, bit rundown and smells of smoke.Different rooms were playing different music, decided to settle in one of the room, wasn't too crowded when we arrived at 11:30 pm, we were refused to sit in a lounge area, the security guard told us that this area is reserved so we ended up sitting next to the dance floor which was still empty. Everytime I bought a drink at the bar I was given a free drink I assume they thought that I am accompanied by a local girl and they gave me free drinks. My wife doesn't drink alcohol so great more for me.After I finished my first drink the security guard keep pushing me to buy another drink and literally he was forcing to buy drinks, i got upset and told him I will buy drink when I feel like, after that he didn't bothered us.We were there for few hours I bought myself five double Chivas Regal on ice and got five for free. Slowly the place started to get busy and you could clearly notice that the majority of the girls there were prostitutes both locals and Russian ethnicity and looking for business.After dancing for little while we left the place around 1:45 am, it was busy at that time but for whatever reason wasn't too comfortable and didn't really feel like staying. Saying that we were not uncomfortable due to the staff or security as commented by some visitors.I don't think that I will ever go back, next time we might some other place."

Mixx Pattaya and Bangkok both do not allow ppl of my religion to enter the night club both in Bangkok and Pattaya..I have travelled the world in Business Class and attended events like the FIFA world cup in Brazil and Tomorrowland in Belgium but I am shocked to know that I face racism in a place like Thailand where the people are known for their hospitality. Though, I am an Indian Sikh by religion and my religion does not allow me to shave my beard or cut my hair but I am well travelled and I know how to carry my self in public. Having said that.. when I reach the entrance of the night club the gentleman at the entry stops me and tells me that I need to shave my beard and cut my hair if i need to enter the club in pattaya. Though I was deeply shocked and saddened by their attitude, I decided not to make a fuss and leave instead of spoiling my night not to mention that I am in a foreign country. I thought that this could be a single call they must have taken because of some nuisance that may have been caused by some drunk countrymen misunderstanding the definition of fun ...!! What really shocked me is that when I tried to go to the MIXX discotheque in Bangkok this was the same kind of response that I got form the gentleman at their door as well ... He told me that that there was no place inside at 11.30 in the night but graciously let a few foreigners enter the club right in front of me... If u really want to filter the crowd put up a minimum entry of buying a bottle if u want to enter or just put up a BIG sign saying that Indians are not allowed. I work hard for the money that I earn and the only reason why i like coming back to Thailand is the fact that everyone is smiling and welcoming.... but if u really don't want me. I shall be more than glad to take my business else where ....We are trying to get rid of racism around the world but a shocker is that we find it in our own back yard.!!!"

It stays open until 5.306am under normal circumstances.  Currently there are a few restrictions on opening hours due to the political situation and it has been forced to close around 3am.There's a nominal door fee some nights  I think 350 baht for guys and free for girls is the most I've every paid.  That gets you entry and one drink.Once inside, the security and waiting staff are pretty attentive.  There is very rarely any trouble there.  Clientele covers tourists, expats and locals.  Most but not ALL of the female customers are 'working'... Therefore don't assume the girl you're talking to is a hooker, she might very well be someone's girlfriend.  Drink prices are reasonable.  3000 100 baht for a bottle of Absolute vodka with some mixers.  That usually gets you a table with very comfy sofas.The club is split into two  a smoking room that usually plays dance music, and a nonsmoking room that plays chart and hip hop.  This is usually the busiest room and the one I prefer as a non smoker.There has been a lot written about the door policy and racism.  Having worked in club security before, I might be able to shed some light on that.Anyone who has been inside Mixx will have seen it's a very multicultural place.  There are white, black, Asian and Arab guests.  However, you will notice there isn't a predominance of any one race.  It's quite balanced  I've partied in there with ALL races.If a club gets a reputation for being an 'Indian' club, other nationalities won't go.  Likewise if it's labelled a 'Black', 'Asian' or 'White' club, it tends to lose other races who don't feel comfortable.Therefore, the management strive to balance the clientele.  If the club already has a large number of Indian guys inside and a group of nine more rocks up, the bouncers make a judgment call.And do other people just walk in  Sure!  Regulars, locals, big spenders, hot girls... It's just business.Is it fair  No... But that's just the way the world works."

I can't really attest to the racist experiences of others, but I went in with my AsianAmerican girlfriend and we had no issues. The friend that took us was a regular there who keeps a table on reserve, so I guess that helped smooth things over. I did notice that the bouncers were a little rough with me until they realized who we were with, so I wouldn't discount the negative experiences of others. I'm also sure it was pretty overpriced but I didn't see the bill. All in all though, probably one of the best nights I've had in BKK.  Definitely a 'who's who' of the Bangkok expat crowd, but with lots of sketchy Russian mafia types. Would definitely go back. If you're a single guy, keep you're wits about you as I'm pretty sure 7080 of the girls there are pros."

We were 9 well dressed guests from top end very well to do business families; all from Dubai, UAE of Indian Origin.The manager at MIXX told me that it's Mixx company policy to allow entry to only smaller crowds and so from my group of 9 6 girls and 3 gentlemen  only 2 couples would be allowed. He said it was a directive from the police and crowd control. While we were listening to him and trying to follow as we had just been to other discos and they all welcomed us, it became clear what was really happening. Right behind us was a huge group of white people and they were all let in, infact welcomed. I confronted the manager he said 'some people can enter as big groups and YOU cannot'. Racist behaviour and extremely rude to non whites. Sir i would like to bring this issue out in your papers. Bangkok is a thriving market for tourism and such institutions should be exposed who practice such open racism. Myself and my friends are ready to testify to this unforseen act of sheer racism.Thanks and RegardsSanjay Batheja"

Not like my review will negatively impact them anyways, but I will speak my truth. Ive been living in Madrid for a month now as an English teacher and have dealt with some insane amounts of racism and have kept it from my family back home but today was just the icing on the cake. A friend of mine and her girlfriends were visiting from France and some after we had some tapas and visiting a couple of places, we decided to check this place out. When we arrived, there was a line and we stood in it as is normal but the bouncers let everyone in but when it was our turn, he pulled the 4 of us out of line and asked about our invitation. The ladies thought it was strange he didnt ask anyone else for invitations but I already knew what it was; I was the WRONG COLOR. But, rather than jump to conclusions, we found someone with an invitation and joined him, but once again were pulled out of line. I tried speaking to the bouncers in Spanish, trying to ask what the problem was but they insisted that they couldnt understand what I was saying. So I motioned to speak to them in English which I knew they spoke but they once again acted as though they couldnt understand me. It was clear that my SKIN COLOR was the problem but because they kept asking my group specifically about our invitation, my friends went up to talk to them after I had a heated conversation with them which was profanity laced. They told my female friends ALL WHITE that they could come in but I wasnt allowed in there. They had no problem acknowledging their racism. Once I started screaming and telling everyone how racist they were, they called for their black employee and pointed at him saying how can we be racist, we have a black guy working in here . I will never visit this establishment ever again not that I can lol and want to make sure my white friends out of respect for me, never visit this place. I will be going back to take pictures of this Human Waste of an institution and will be posting it for everyone to see.

We asked another bouncer who didnt speak English why we werent allowed in. After about 5 minutes the original bouncer told us we werent allowed in because of my boyfriends tattoos and he was to go home and change. I said to the bouncer this is discrimination, you cant discriminate against someone because of their tattoos. He laughed and walked away.

Being black I almost recoiled when I saw the litany of racism accusations on the reviews. However the classy party royalty in me took over.Through out my frequent travels, I had always insisted on partying at the most exclusive clubs and lounges..from Dubai,London,New York, Houston,Boston,Atlanta,Las Vegas,Miami........etc I had always partied with the most select crowd, so I decided I ll confirm if the profiling in Teatro is about race or about setting a bar.. I have always had that chip on my shoulder when I turn out in my designer ""flyness"" and my ""Naija swag"" and of course that Black American Express card was definitely going to swing me past any unwanted scrutiny. It was everything I expected, ushered in swiftly, presented my VIP pass and was immediately swept in to the party frenzy. Being a hip hop, RB and Afrobeat head I surprised myself at how much I rocked to Latin and Spanish beats on the main floor. Music was spiced up with a healthy dose of hip hop tunes from drake,Chris Brown and other heavy hitters. The Spanish Chica Bonitas were friendly, seriously feeling a ""fly homie""and the partying/getting down was nonstop....... Explored all 7 floors up to the smoke lounge at the top.Of course spent a considerable time at the Hip Hop RnB floors where some of the old school joints got me really nostalgic. TEATRO CAPITAL WAS THE BOMB.....Holla Madrid....Already planning my return...Didn't experience the much talked about racism, actually saw some white kids outside who were not allowed in....it's possible that it exists, but didn't experience any.....Big Ups to Teatro Kapital....Shall be back!!!!!"

How do I know this: my boyfriend is white and the bouncers let him through but told us to wait. I am black and our friends are Asian. After we were told to go, white Spanish people were allowed in. We stood outside the club for a while to watch what was going on. Two Arab men were turned away, mixed and black people were turned away. A lady wearing a hijab was also turned away. It's important to note that white British people weren't allowed in at the time we were there. So the discrimination was against race and nationality. I hope that more people write about what they have experienced. The more people's truths are told, the more problems like this can be highlighted and hopefully people in positions of power will start doing something to stop such discrimination."

I was with a group of 10 people, which was a mix of Latinos and AfricanAmericans. I had read reviews about Kapital before going, and I knew it had a history of racism, but thought I would take a chance. I was the person who made my group's reservation, and I showed the confirmation email to both bouncers. I'm an AfricanAmerican woman from the U.S., but I can speak Spanish, I was dressed pretty nicely, and I was with a group of girls, so I have a feeling that's why I got in. All the AfricanAmerican men that I was with tried to get in, but were told that they ""weren't dressed nicely enough"". However, several white boys were wearing things objectively worse than they were, and they got in without a problem. Kapital uses their ""strict dress code"" as a way to discriminate against prospective patrons. If you are a person of color, not a Spanish speaker or you are not wearing something you would wear to a wedding, then there is a 99 you won't get in. In any case, I would strongly recommend NOT going to Kapital because I find it morally bankrupt, and people shouldn't support an organization that is clearly racist and colorist. There are plenty of clubs and bars in Spain, so I would suggest going to another one. If you DO decide to go, there are several things you should know. The ""free entry"" thing is a scam. If you make a reservation, the confirmation code you receive in an email is a discount, where you can get two drinks for 17 euros. It isn't possible to get in without paying. Once inside, I also realized that the ""7 dance floors"" they heavily promote is also a scam. There are at most 3 dance floors, and each one has a bar looking over it. There is also a lounge upstairs. The first floor is the largest, and plays a combination of Spanish music, pop music, and EDM. The second dance floor is on the fourth floor and plays ""RB and hip hop music"", but it's often a hit or miss. They play music by black people and thinks it falls into that category, but half of it isn't really music you can dance to. The 6th floor is the Latino music floor, which was okay. It isn't nearly as extraordinary as they advertise it, and honestly is not the worth the time or stress."

It is worth noting that I am a white, well spoken and well presented British female, and as such am lucky enough not to be exposed to racist behaviour often. My boyfriend is a well mannered, well presented and educated Brazilian national who has lived in the UK for 27 years, he booked us tickets for this club as special surprise for me and when we arrived he approached the bouncers and showed them the tickets, he was waved to the back of the long line for us to queue up, so like polite British people we did as he said despite the booked tickets.  In front of us were a group of scruffily dressed tracksuit bottoms, tshirts and trainers early 20s males who got in without a problem, when we got to the front of the queue, my boyfriend once again politely presented the tickets and was roughly ushered towards the other bouncer, who proceeded to demand to see his passport which is British incidentally and then asked tell him to undo his jacket and show him what he was wearing a smart polo shirt, Chinos and smart trainers he then looked at him in digust and said in 'There's a dress code in here, this isn't smart enough' and told him that we could not come in and that was final.  I was disgusted at how rude he was and at this clearly false reason for not allowing him entry, and now having read some more reviews on the club it would seem that they have a problem with anyone resembling Middle Eastern or South American heritage. As a well travelled Londoner I am horrified that people and places like this can be allowed to continue with this unacceptable behaviour."

Our white skinned friends immediately in front of us got in no problem, no questions asked. The bouncer then turned to us, saw we were tourists / ethnically different and claimed we needed an ""invite"" to come in, when we saw people immediately behind and in front of us get in with no qualms. They then murmured incoherently in Spanish that they didn't speak English and even refused to respond to my friend in Spanish. We then tried getting in with a group of British girls whom we met outside and they still refused, letting the girls in and showing us out of the queue, despite the nice girls claiming we were together.

We all waited to enter, no more that 5 minutes. About 8 of us entered and paid 22, expensive but we already were aware this was the case before we arrived. Two black friends were at the back of the group and told they would have to pay 50 each, once the rest of us had already paid. Just to clarify all of us were smartly dressed and the two boys charged 50 were wearing almost the same as all of the white boys who entered for 22. Once inside although the pictures look quite good and the lighting is quite impressive, stupidly overpriced drinks mean a night slows after a few hours when you begin to sober. Go somewhere without the brand and have a much better spontaneous night out without being racially profiled by a power hungry meathead. Alternatively if you are still seeking a large capacity club you will have an infinitely better time at Joy Eslava. Only marginally cheaper but ten times the atmosphere."

I visited Madrid the last 5 days of a 2 week trip to Spain in July 2015. We tried to visit at least 1 nightclub in each city as I do everywhere I travel. I checked TripAdvisor for reviews and narrowed it down to a few places...Kapital being one of them. Most of the reviews I glanced at seemed OK except for a few mentioning the staff possible being racist....and mostly complai nts of a 20 cover charge being too expensive.  We thought we'd see for ourselves, so we got dressed up and headed over.  When we arrived I noticed the clientele milling around out front. Not too impressive, average looking dressed a little to casual for what I'm used to at a popular nightclub in a major city.  It was a Thursday night so I decided to give them a pass on that one.  When we walked up the bouncers looked at us and proceeded to say 50 euro EACH to enter.  That's about 54. Let me preface by saying i have NEVER been charged to get in ANY nightclub, let alone 54!  I've not been charged in New York City, Los Angeles, Miami or even Las Vegas! So I certainly wasn't going to let a club that lets females wearing jean shorts and flip flops in, charge me 54. Im sure THEY did not pay 50 euro for entry.  So apparently even though we could get in the most exclusive nightclubs elsewhere, we were not of the ""type"" that appeals to this place. Before they could open their mouths to say anything else i flagged down the next cab driving by and headed to Joy. They had a cover of 12 euro which included a cocktail and gogo dancers. No problem with that. "

There wasn't much of a queue when we arrived as it was a Thursday so didn't wait too long to get to the front, probably 510 mins Maximum. There were 4 drunk locals ahead of us who where barely standing so we fancied our chances of getting in. Our group consisted of 6 people all mixed races from London; we approached the entrance and bouncer took one look at us and said ""no"" and began ushering us to the side to let the guys behind us through. Naturally our reaction was to ask ""why"" and his response was....while pointing at his arm and my friend's arm and he then stated ""nationality"" nothing else. We initially thought we'd misheard but our Portuguese guide had been taking us to various bars earlier told us that he had stated very clearly that it was because of the colour of our skin. At that point as you can imagine where fairly vexed however reframed from kicking off as our guide told us that the bouncers could make the situation worse if they called the police so we stepped away in shock. I wouldn't have had an issue if the bouncer had said ""there were too many guys"" or that you need to ""get a table to come in"" as that is expected with groups of guys but to blatantly refused based on our skin colour is shocking. This has never happened to myself and i would suggest that if you're ever going to Portugal and want to go to a club, then avoid this place at all costs.It's sad to see that Racism at this level still exists in parts of Portugal; we never had this issue anywhere else in Portugal and fortunately the incident didn't ruin our holiday but  it will definitely make me think twice about going to Portugal again."

Called the bar ahead of time to ask about the dress code and was told that it's ""casual, everyday wear"". Arrived in 2 separate cabs. 3 of us got into the club, no problem and they charged us 12 euros each. Inside the club, girls were wearing adidas sneakers and guys were in tshirts and jeans. In our group of 3, 2 of us had hats on and were told to take them off. We coatchecked the hats for 1 euro each. The second cab had 2 of our friends  one who was black and the other brown. They arrived 5 minutes after us and were told they couldn't come in if they weren't on guest list. When they told the bouncers their friends arrived less than 10 minutes ago, the bouncers told them to go to the side door but they couldn't get in through the front. They proceeded to the side door and the bouncers there told them it was 250 euros EACH. They refused to pay. It was around 1:30 AM at this time and the club was less than half full. We decided to pay our bills and leave, however I asked to speak to the manager to find out exactly why our friends were refused entry. When the manager came out, he told me that it was ""up to the doormen and they can charge anywhere from 12 euros to 250 euros"". I was really calm as we didn't wanna start trouble in a new city. I told him ""I don't want to cause any trouble, I just want to know why they were charged 20 times the price we were charged"". He said ""you have to talk to the doorman, I don't have any answers for you."" I was confused, as the manager of the bar had no answers and seemed to just tell me that it was up to them whether they would let someone in based on their skin color. I told him ""ok I'm sorry to hear that, I just wanted a reason and to know that you weren't racist. We will be leaving now"". After getting my friends hats from coatcheck, we were about to leave. The manager came back up to me and told me ""I don't  want you to think I'm racist because we have one black guy working here"". I said ""sir I'm not asking about your employees I just want to know why my friends were charged 20 times the price."" He said ""come we can go talk to the doorman but it is up to him. In Portugal the doormen can choose who they let in"". When we talked to the doorman he gave us the reason that ""your friends were dressed too sporty"". I said ""we got in with tshirts and jeans but my black friend in a sweater and black shoes and my brown friend in a dress shirt is too sporty"" He said ""your friends are borderline sporty, his tshirt is from adidas but we just let you guys in"". I told them that we called ahead of time and they told us ""casual everyday clothing"" but ""thank you and we're going to leave"". This place is full of racist employees who are on a power trip. They don't care about how they treat their customers. I wish we had read reviews ahead of time because seeing all the negative reviews, I would never have come to begin with! As a sidenote, beers are 4 euros for small cups and gin and soda is 6 euros. It's a tourist trap and not worth it. We went to Pink Street instead and there are so many bars that are full of locals and people drinking on the streets.I know that racism exists but I've never experienced something as blatant as this. I was outraged and wish that I had gotten the whole thing on video. We didn't want to start anything because we are smarter than that and it's not worth ruining the rest of our vacation. Never come here! It's not worth it and I would never want to support an organization like this full of racist management."

They got extremely aggressive, they were racist and I was pinned to the ground at one point when I tried to explain that as a large group they clearly missed me out. One of my friends was pushed against a wall when she tried to help reason with them. A group of really kind British guys stepped in to help support me, one of them offered to pay for me to get out but he was immediately put in a headlock. I was ushered back into the club and was told not to come back out until 7am it was about 5am at this point, whilst back in the club very upset and shaken up by the whole thing I was followed around by bouncers with walkie talkies, I felt like a criminal and was incredibly humiliated! Meanwhile, my friends asked to see the manager, they were met by the owner, who resembled Count Dracula in his appearance, extremely intimidating and behaved like some sort of cruel dictator, absolutely consumed by power and getting a great deal of satisfaction by the level of helplessness he was inflicting! We were about to call the police but a group of Portuguese chaps, who were mortified by the behaviour of the bouncers, advised us not to bother, he said we would probably get arrested and they would have no ability to reason either. Eventually, they allowed my friend to pay them 50, which was received with a horrible smirk! After having such a fun night with my friends, my experience in this club was certainly not the icing on the cake, it was nothing short of disgusting and I would strongly advise anyone thinking of going here, male or female, to avoid it at all costs!"

I am living in England for the last 10 years and regularly go to Portugal in Holidays. This summer I went to Lisbon and on a night out with my cousin   we decided to hit the night we went to Bairro Alto and some night clubs in the 24 de Julho and saw this quite new spot that seemed very cool from the outside, we queued for nearly an hour and when we got to the door we saw one of their Reps talking to a bouncer pointing at us. When we got to the door the Rep was hiding behind the bouncer and the bouncer refused our entry saying that the club was full but if we made a reservation and paid 250 euros we could gain access to the club, this while the people queuing behind us where just being let in. From there we could see that the house wasn't even half full.I also saw that only white people was being let in while indians and dark skinned people where being turned away. A shameful behavior that shouldn't be tolerated but unfortunately it seems that they can get away with it. You can read the reviews of that place and we can see that this is a common practice for them. My advice is that if you want to enjoy your night without any discrimination go elsewhere, Lisbon at night is fun and the most exciting places and parties let everyone in so stay away from this place."

But paying a fee just because youre a little bit too much taned or look local is just unacceptable. Were in 2019..... We actually felt really bad for the locals who were as well being refused access unless paying the  skin colour access fee ...Some tourists were surprised by such policies and decided to not enter the party.After few minutes the manager decided to show up and invited us to enter for free.

I asked what that meant and he made a comment about them granting admission based on the crowd. I immediately asked if that meant that they were not letting in black people, as that is how the comment read to me. So I let it slide and get back in line because I figure we will just get to the door soon.

I don't budge because I still would like to know what the problem is. He asked us to step to the side and says someone will be giving us a ticket. I ask a ticket for what He yells and says a ticket to come back next week which I'm sure was a lie. I tell him we don't want the ticket as we would not be returning, but I would like to know the reason we can't come in this night. Mind you, as he tells us we can't get in, they still let in groups of WHITE women that were behind us in line. So I ask why were they able to get in and we could not. Then call all these other men to come over. One gets directly in my face in a threatening manner and puts his hand in my face and tells me to move. At this point I felt super threatened.

I ask repeatedly is it because we are black. Actually, I'm 100 sure it was because we are black, but it annoys me when RACISTS hide behind lies. He gives me the typical racist response ""my boss is black"" which I know is a lie. We eventually left but I would not recommend this establishment to ANYONE. Absolutely no need to have 5 grown men that feels it's necessary to confront three BLACK women as if we are MEN. I would never spend my money here. I am actually giving his club zero stars"

It appears they are only letting in white Germans under the disguise of being a ""members only"" club. We were chatting with the white German girls in front of us who weren't ""club members"" and they got in with no problem. After being denied entry we were waiting outside for a German friend who was already inside also not a member and watched them repeatedly deny foreigners and nonwhites. I would encourage others not to patronize this place. "

This club is just NOT WORTH THE DRAMA. I went for my friends birthday 5 girls we were told through promoters that we would get into the club for free and have a table with drinks but this wasnt the case. DONT LISTEN TO THE PROMOTERS THEYRE SELLING LIES. While queuing to get into the club as it opened we saw people getting turned away at the door and thought it was strange. We then got to the bouncer and we explained that we were on the LUX guest list and he replied saying that two of us can go free but the other three had to pay 20 entry fee. This was annoying as it is an extortionate amount to pay to get into a bar and we had been told that we wouldnt have to pay entry but we just split the 60 five ways and got on with it. We went into the club after texting the LUX promoters that we had arrived and they replied telling us to go to table 26/27 having never been to drama before and there were no table numbers this was a hassle in itself. We eventually found the table and saw people sitting there so we asked the man looking after the table if we had the right one and he said he would take us to our table soon but he was just serving drinks so we agreed and waited patiently. After about 20 minutes it became obvious that he wasnt going to help us so I said to him that we were still waiting for our table and he just replied youre sharing here and walked away. This was so frustrating as we were sharing a table with 3 other groups if not more so all of the free drinks with the table had been drank and there was no seating left at all. That was all within the first hour of being there and it only disappointed me more as the night went on! The promoters were rude, the atmosphere was pretentious, there is blantant racism on display, the drink prices are extortionate 50 for three drinks!, the list goes on... We eventually got kicked out for changing into flat shoes  Im assuming that didnt fit the image theyre looking for. The only good thing about my night was my company. Will not be returning, not worth the instagram pics."

This would obviously make the night more affordable and special for her! We did have our doubts as the reviews for Drama online are pretty poor with terms like racist and rude appearing overly a lot you wont be accepted into the club if you dont fit with the  overall image. The promoter even asked for a photo of us before hand  how shallow!!!!Anyway, we decided to overlook the negatives and try to prove them wrong. Upon arrival we queues up and instantly got told entry is 20 each. After a little bit of confusion, all 6 of us came together to pay the entry as we were told once we were inside we will have an excellent night. However, as we were about to pay one of the guards and managers I guess said that 5 of us could pay 60 in total and come in but not the 6th girl. She wasnt drunk and they expected us to ditch our friend in the middle of central London on her own for no apparent reason. I think being treated the way we were was a complete joke for a highend club, not only were we sold a lie but were treated like mugs. After chatting to a few people, even one of the staff said Libertine is a lot better. So we ended up with a promoter and a table there, saving our friends birthday and having the night of our lives!!!!!! I do not recommend this club unless you dont mind being treated like a 2 year old by a bunch of shallow people."

I really try to be fair in my reviews but this club has to be exposed for its treatment to blacks in particular. I thought the other reviewers were over the top but its true people..every single negative review is true. Here goes...Went there  with my 3 friends to celebrate  one of our best friends birthday who is black..dressed up,  Names on the guest list etc. Got there at around 22.45. We were then asked if we were on the guest list by a clipboard holder and a bouncer. We gave her our names at which point the clipboard holder said our black friends name was not down so she could not get in. I said it was her birthday and I had called the promoter to put our names down. She rolled her eyes and said you 3 can get in but she cant. The bouncer then said if she wants to get in she has to pay 20 but you lot can go in for free..meaning the 3 of us white ladies. We could not believe what we were hearing. It ruined her birthday and our night. We left!Its shocking that this kind of thing goes on and this club is getting away with hiding behind the guest list nonsense in order to discriminate against minorities, black people especially. We witnessed 4 black couples being  humiliated and turned away for no reason. So Drama Park Lane, please treat people with respect..your club is racist and the whole world should know.

I have visited clubs elsewhere never have i encountered such treatment, i mean was i too black for that club or what I to be honest didnt expect such shadyness in a city that is so used to tourists. They really need to learn how to treat people with dignity."

I got to the entrance and the bouncer ask for my ID. I assumed that he did this to verify my age. So not the case. He told me point blank that they do not allow ""black people"". At first I wasn't sure I had heard his correctly. So I asked him to repeat what he said. He said and I quote, ""Your skin is black, not allowed"". I think that this establishment has a problem with Africans, but I'm not from Africa, I'm from South America. And he, in his ignorance just assumed that I  was from Africa which shouldn't even be an issue because I'm black. When I proceeded to ask what being black has to do with me being allowed in the club or not, he shoved me aside. Literally. I was flabbergasted. But decided to just let it go and leave. I wouldn't want to demand entrance into a place that is so discriminatory. Please, in the future, tell your bouncers to be respectful. No one, regardless of where they are from deserves to be treated the way I was treated."

According to the  so called  pretigious insanity club indians just order one drink and sit wid it whole nite. I was quite disaoppinted with the attitude of  club towards indians as if we dont have money to buy drinks and people from other countries are gud enuf to afford. I hope they do change their attitude.

Then the darker coloured girl who was with him asked why they couldn't come inside because the guards didn't tell them yet and one of the guards said there was a private party, even though we were already in and we didn't know anybody. We already went in with 14 people, so they already earned 133 because of us before they rejected our friends. We tried for almost an hour to let our friends in. The guards didn't even listen to them and ignored them just like they weren't there, even when our girlfriend was crying and begging them to let her in. Eventually we all left the club, leaving our 133 with them. We were in shock by this behaviour and we will NEVER go back to this place."

So we did that and after our drinks, went to make the line and before we made it to the door, a man asked if we had invitation and the moment I said ""no we have"" he didn't even let me finished and grabbed my arm and pulled me and my friends out of the line, he didn't even let me explain, or ask if we had to pay to get in... he treated us like we were the worst and trying to talk to the other security was the same deal. We asked for the manager and they laugh saying he was on vacation.  They just ruined our first night in Barcelona and unfortunately it feels like its a very racist place which is the wrong attitude for place that depends a lot on tourism. I have never felt this bad or treated that way in my 34 years... We are girls that are always well dressed and well educated, we have traveled around and visited many party cities like Dubai, Vegas, NYC, Miami and been to the best places in those cities and we never experience anything like what we did in Barcelona. Pure racist and lack of education.  And I want to make clear that we are not upset that we couldn't go in... we are not 20 yrs old anymore where something like that matters, plus we have been to better places. The issue is how these uneducated people treated us, is just unacceptable and nobody should be treated that way. We were in a total shock at first and couldn't understand why we couldn't be told in a nice way, ""unfortunately its invitation only"" and we would have left to another place with no issue. The reason I am writing this review is so no one else experience anything like this at this place.And to the management of bling bling... remember you are a business not GOD, therefore you depend on people to be standing and nothing is forever unless you provide outstanding services... which bling bling lacks."

They should know that obviously many tourists prefer not to carry their passports with them at all times, especially when roaming around locally in trains and taxis, that too heading out for a party at a nightclub! One could easily misplace it! So of course we'd left them back at the hotel in the safe. We then asked them, couldn't they accept our driving license as an ID proof They then diverted the issue and came up with a fresh problem  your shoes ain't right, go around the corner, find a shop, buy new shoes and then come back. I'm not making this up, he literally said those exact words to me, all the while sheepishly avoiding eye contact. I had a minor suspicion we were being treated unfairly because of race/color, but this confirmed it. For the first time in my life i've encountered such rude behaviour, and we're well traveled. From US to Europe, nowhere have we ever encountered such horrible staff.  All the negative reviews of this place have been consistently highlighting this problem with this particular nightclub  may be its time for someone to take note Horrible experience, we eventually went to a much nicer place and had a better evening than we would have had here even if they'd let us in, I'm sure of that."

I asked them; ""so how do I make reservations for tomorrow"" The question threw them off and the bouncers mumbled something to the effect that we don't know and don't bother us.

Now why would you only stop us of all the people We were dressed up class, well mannered and behaved and this is how you treat us in return This clearly shows the act of discrimination which is definitely not accepted anywhere in the world.Also when my friend asked this guy which other place you would recommend us to go to.

It is situated on the 6th floor with a quick lift where on opening you are greeted by security and then ushered into the interior.  There is an inside and outside drinking area.  Attended the inside this time around and I wasn't disappointed. The club has a great atmosphere after 11pm, with disco dancers, DJ etc and very attentive waiters, each having a lit name tag on their chests. The mood was great as was the music and dancing.  A great place to come and people watch as there are men and women from around the world coming here.  I have read of the staff being racist but haven't seen anything from my attendance there to indicate this.  But may be possible.  I have never been charged entry fee nor had any trouble finding a place, such as the barrels that are placed around the dance floor, to place my drinks.

We explained the situation to another one and he was okay with us and asked for passports. We showed the soft copies we had in our phones and they replied that won't do and said we need to have a paper copy of it.

BUT we heard it was a beautiful church turned club and though, What do we really have to lose HAha we even started to make other plans while in the taxi asking about other nearby bars.We arrived 15 minutes after opening and walked right in. No issues there. You do have to pay a 20 cover charge which I thought was ridiculous. Their is a coat check for 2 euro which I loved since it was a cold night but I obviously still wanted to wear a dress. Drinks were approximately 1518 but were nice and strong.  A all night restroom pass is 3 or .50 cents each time. I for one have a small bladder so 3 euros it was. At 11am the place was basically dead but we really had a chance to appreciate the lighting, architecture, etc. The club started to pick up at 12:30am and thats when the party really got started. Music ranged from EDM to some 90s throwbacks which we went nuts for! Honestly, minus the crazy cover charge oh and my card being charged twice for the same order we would come back and recommend this place to anyone looking for good nightlife in Brussels. "

I called up the office immediately to enquire about this, but they advised that you normally would not need a reservation to get inside, but it's totally the guards discretion, otherwise. A similar group of Asians little behind us also denied the entry, even though the Europeans/ people with fair complexion were allowed in. Unprofessional attitude from the club/guards.

We spent in excess of over 1500 only to find that the doormen stole our driving licences upon entry they scanned them for ID purposes but never returned them.Initially I thought this was an innocent mistake and contacted the club via email. I received no response via email so followed up with a call. During the phone call I was offered no apology which would be the professional thing to do upon the news of an initial complaint. I was then told I would receive a call back which I did not so I followed up with another call. I was told they cannot find the licences so someone will contact me via email. I was contacted by James Spallone  managing director. Well James is an interesting chap. He insinuated 1500 is not a lot of money to spend in 2 hours 200 per person and even suggested I had no reason for complaint as the bill was paid for by one individual who was not me  as if I spent no money so shouldnt complain that sensitive documents have been stolen by their door staff. I couldnt quite believe the tone I was faced with. He then sent me another email claiming to have checked the cctv and found the licences were handed back to us. Ok, if this is the case, but he then followed up with another email which completely contradicted this and asked me to provide a description of the door staff so he can find out if anyone is stealing them  well if the cctv shows they were returned then why would you need these details When I was unable to provide a facial description of the doormen he then claimed that I obviously cannot remember whether they were returned. Obviously if James has checked the CCTV as claimed then he should also have an accurate description of who they were handed to and therefore not require one from me or my guests. I suspect there could be a potential issue of fraud and would strongly advise anyone against visiting this venue. I now see why they have had such bad press in the past  arent they also known as the RACIST club Well they can now add THIEVES to their resume and I will be notifying the police."

So the decision was made none of us would go in as it was my 21st birthday ruined for no apparent reason by a scouse girl on the door.  Her responses were almost robotic when I asked why with her saying ""I can't do that"" every time.  Whilst we watched her let in other men, so evidently they were still being allowed in.  As we stood on the street then deciding what to do the manager came out and spoke to us to ask what was going on/why we were still standing there.  I was very upset by this point.  Once I explained the situation he said he saw absolutely no reason as to why we were told my boyfriend could not come in and apologised profusely.  So I can only assume the dreadful scouse girl on the door looked at my boyfriend and made a judgement due to what she could see, his physical appearance, perhaps ethnicity, that he was not coming in.  By this point I was so angry and upset that my 21st birthday was totally ruined and we had to go elsewhere.  This club is racist, sexist and senseless.  It does not even deserve one star."

This club is racist, they choose who to let in at the door based on your face and skin colour. Ladies you could be wearing the most expensive heels on and the sexist dress, if your face doesn't cut it ... you won't get in and they make that quite clear at the door. This is regardless if you're on the guest list and promised to get in by a promoter.  First occasion they just didn't let me and my girls in after waiting over an hour in about three different queues even though we were on the guest list. Me and my girls were looking glam and classy but I guess our Asian looks didn't cut it for the people at the door. We were simply told a ""no way you're not getting in"". We thought nothing of of it and just left Had s great night at dstrkt instead which I highly recommendThe second night trying to get in was yesterday. The promoter confirmed we were exclusively in his guest list! And to make sure we weren't double booked at any other club and promised an entry. Again waiting in the queue for over an hour  ps there's an ""ugly queue"" on the opposite side of the road, so if you're ugly sadly you get asked to stand on the other side of the road . The only people in the actual queue getting in, were white blonde girls. The promoter kept promising  us  that we will get in and he battled our way to the main queue fighting with other promotors. When it was finally got our turn to get in, she again decided  that we were to ugly clearly our skin colour wasn't to her fancy and told us we ain't coming in regardless. We waiting roughly an hour and half to once again get rejected for no reason. At this point I was fuming. It was absolutely absurd, we have never ever been treated like this before, even in clubs that are more high end then libertine. After I raised my voice calling the club racist and threatening to complain,  the promoter spoke to the manager who finally let us obviously with a 20 pound entry. Pretty sure it's free if you're white and blonde. Now after the battle of getting in, it was difficult to have a good time, it was a very basic basic club, I honestly do not understand what the hype is about, overly packed with girls, hardly any room to breathe let alone dance, the venue itself was basic.  Please do not come here. This club is such a waste of time.  Dear people at the door. You're all a bunch of puppets, specially the lady at the door. You're rude. In fact you're very rude. You whispered to the promoter that were ugly, we heard you. You're pretty bad looking yourself. Dear libertine, honestly you need to calm the hype. You're club isn't all that at all. Ps you should allow more guys in to the balance the ratio, it was pretty boring looking at girls all night. Will never ever go there again and I'll make sure I'll let every one around me know."

Non of us were drunk or rude either. I was even told my faux fur scarf was too hippy  JUST WEIRD  and that it was because we were wearing coats Eventually I just asked the promoter who was black if it was because we were a group of black/mixed raced women and he admitted that 'Yes, this is probably the reason' and that he himself as a black man would be turned away at the door!I suggest you don't play any RnB and Hip Hop or music of any black origin in your club.

Turned around to see that my husband, brother in law and friend were all told to step out of the queue. They were all refused entry. No reasons were given, because they had a disclaimer sign and all the security staff did was point to the sign that said management reserve the right to refuse entry and no reason is needed to be given! Having observed what then followed, it was clear that racial profiling was the decision maker here. Numerous other guests, of ethnic backgrounds were turned away. When we challenged security, they stuck by their disclaimer, though one did say to me ""I know the reason, but if I told you I would lose my job"". That clearly is confirmation that the racial profiling exists and that my husband et al were refused entry because of their ethnicity. To add to this ignorant and discriminating behaviour, another security staff then said that we can come back Monday, suggesting Monday was the day that ethnic minorities were allowed!

Went inside and sat on a couch, i was told you will have to pay 50 Thb for it and have to compulsory buy full bottle of any drink. We were two friends, so wasnt useful for us, we were moved to another table, where it was compulsory to drink all the time u were sitting, in every 10 min staff member comes to see you. Talking about the crowd there were a lot of girls mostly prostitutes which ask for price after you are drunk and approach her. Afterall itz all about money. But however they be too rude if have finished your drink whether you pay a lot of tip. Bad part was that after having 8 pegs and 6 beer, the time i finshed my drink, they said me to stand or else buy one more to sit. Respect for Indians is none, and the reason behind i went was that usually indians order 12 drinks and sit and try seeking on girls everyone does that but one should have that sophistication. I am a partyholic and didnt went for the reason of finding girls so didnt cared much. I would like to say every INDIAN, the reputation we are building is on upto us, this review may not be helpful because mostly UNCLES OF AGE 40 and above do that and does not care reviewing the tripadvisor.

The dowstairs bar had tired rock music playing and not much of a crowd, so we headed upstairs and were turned away because there was a thai man in our party. We were a group of americans and british tourists and the idea that they refuse entry to a thai in Thailand is racist and ugly in the 21st century. There are plenty of places to hang out in Pattaya with fat ugly foreigners trying to pick up thai women who cant get any attention if there are any thai men to compete. Obviously this club wants to cultivate that business too. I go out to dance and have fun and I enjoy partying with thai people in Thailand.

I have lived in Dubai for four years and have never come across anything like this.  Last night, we were in a group so some of our white friends had already entered.

This is ridiculous because there were people in our group who were definitely a lot drunker but were allowed entry but they were white. We tried to reason with the staff as we felt this might be a racist decision and we wouldnt quietly walk away if someone is simply basing their decision on someones skin colour. There was also a man from the bar possibly a manager or a supervisor who very rudely told us we were simply not allowed in and his decision was made and where did we think we were going I asked him to tell us exactly why he thought we were too drunk and others werent, to which he replied let me call the police and they can tell you that. We told them to call the police but by this point in the argument, the bouncers had already grabbed hold of two of the women in our group and physically were pushing them out in hotel lobby to remove us from the entrance. When our male friends tried to intervene, they were grabbed and shoved out even harder. When i asked the bouncer are you going to manhandle women He responded with a simple yes. As this all occurred in the hotel lobby, hopefully theres a cc tv recording from the hotel to prove it, if the management is interested to view this. Needless to say, this was beyond acceptable and I would advise people with ethics to boycott this place as its racist, sexist and physically assaults women."

They asked the securities if it was because he was a foreigner with dark skin, and one security grabbed the arm of the girl and pushed her!!! This is NOT OKAY! This is harassment!!!!

He was better dressed than most of the trashy people waiting on the line and there is nothing wrong with him. Then we tried the second line and my friend already prepared his german passport for control and we managed to get in. However, again, hateful stares at my friend and asked me if we are ""really"" together.

Additionally, we offered to pay only to be told we were not welcome. Hadnt had a drink or any of the usual other reasons for being denied entry.To put it simply, they didnt want us in because they didnt like us as we were British.

We arrived at the club around midnight on a Saturday, got straight in with no questions asked, just smiles. The admission fee was 12 euros. Huge club with 3 floors with different music and vibe. Rooftop bar with huge sofas and a nice view. The design of the club is stunning and it looks really great. For my taste, the music was a bit repetitive and I'm not a fan of inside smoking. Pretty steep prices on drinks, but at least the Moscow mule I had was really good. I would recommend this club. "

The two men then shared that it would cost 240pp which would be 1,440 for my group only, which may I add was not worth it just by looking at the building.  The building was run down, there was drunk old men laying down at the entrance with the bouncers pushing and hitting him.  I felt a little unsafe.  Myself and my group felt discriminated against as we were not locals.  We are over here to visit the city and felt very unwelcome and I will definitely never recommend this club to anyone!!  The bouncers were extremely patronising and aggressive, they made us feel uncomfortable and almost ruined our Friday night but we never let that happen.  Never go here as it is absolutely terrible.  I've never been so disappointed in a club in my life and I was extremely disappointed in how unwelcome I felt.

So we went in, thinking we so 'lucky', we made it! And guess what. The place is just OK. I have seen clubs likes all over the US and they are begging for business. New York alone has 20 clubs bigger, lavisher, with better music and crowd. Neither is the ambience, decor, music, or crowd worth the trouble. Plus the bartenders are racist. I would give the place 2.5 star as a club but because of the way they treat people, it is a zero star."

Twice we were told by smokers outside the club that it was empty, and that it wasn't really as lively as they had hoped, but both times we were turned away because the club was 'full'.

Bar staff including a racist Chinese man, refused to serve us, we found this laughable as he of all people should know how it feels to be at the hands of racists, he was completely ignoring us served others who had come to bar after us, deliberately made us wait then he was extremely rude when he did decide to serve us, had a face like thunder at all times, at 1 point he even sent someone else to serve us even though he was doing absolutely nothing just because he didn't want to, when he had no choice but to serve us, he had the cheek to wait around for a tip which we would of happily given, had he been polite to us, like we were to him but instead he treated us as though we did something wrong clearly he did all of the above because we were black. We are nice people, we caused no trouble at all, we drank all night when we eventually got served we danced all night, socialised  met some great people but when the 2 guys went back the following night the bouncers made them wait outside for ages well over an hour in the freezing cold minus centigrade for no reason  gave them no reason as to why, just left them there waiting, kept snarling at them  trying to intimidate them by being rude and telling them to move out the way to let others in simply again acted towards them in this way because they were black. After waiting around for so long realising the bouncers were not going to let them in they then went on to have a great night elsewhere with no discrimination, may I also add at this point the said 2 guys are hard working, law abiding citizens who are two famous music producers from London  New York 1 was even recognised by a Prague local who told the bouncer of his status  who simply just wanted a tourist night out  were looking at a possible after party venue hire for a festival coming up in August. Big mistake fancy lounge, you play black music but do not like black people, that is very bizarre.  And as for the manager/owner don't bother writing back that your club is not racist because  CLEARLY IS as we experienced first hand, YOU may not be but your staff are. I suggest you have a staff meeting about your club discrimination policy and how to be polite and courteous to the general public despite what colour they are and most importantly CUSTOMER CARE and address the issue with them instead, hopefully they will understand that everybody is the same regardless of colour and may I also point out that using the term 'coloured' as a reference to black people or anyone of colour is not politically correct, this could also be classed as a racist remark, just thought I'd point that out to you as you used it in response to one of your other reviews claiming your club was RACIST.

In over 22 years I have seen a tremendous amount of shows. In Vegas, this is the funniest we have ever seen.  We laughed so hard our stomachs actually hurt.  Take the warnings seriously.  This show is definitely NOT for everyone.  If you get offended, absolutely go see something else.  Not for children or those who are interested in hearing things that are politically correct.  You will find everything from racy to racist.  This show is epically sassy.  Found in a very unique setting, an actual circus tent in front of Caesars Palace.  You pick up your tickets out front, and this show is generally sold out.  If you want to see it, plan ahead.  If you want great seats, this is the show to splurge on.  If you sit in the front 3 rows, you can plan on being involved, made fun of, and probably peeing your pants with laughter. While the ringmaster and his assistant are super entertaining and hilarious comediansthe acts that this show is comprised of are some of the most amazing things you will ever see in person.  Since the venue is not huge, the seats are all decent, but closer is better, and will give you an experience you will never forget.  These gymnasts, acrobats, dancers, skaters and entertainers are all amazing athletes.  All their acts are truly jaw dropping, and you will look at your neighbor over and over and say How is this possible!  How can they do that!  Did you see that!!  The amount of strength  talent these men and women have is just incredible.  I want to thank them all for giving us an amazing evening of entertainment.The downsides you ask  The drinks are expensive, and the seats are put in very close together.  It really gives you the feel of an old school traveling circus. We thought it was pretty cool the way they have it set up. Obviously, people that are easily offended will feel like they wasted their money.  The gentleman next to us left within a few minutes.  It appeared the majority of the audience stayed and had a wonderful time.  Again, use your personal discretion by educating yourself about what you are going to see, so you dont chose something and regret the decision.  Dont read about this, attend it, get offended and give them a bad review.  They are very upfront in letting people know this show has offensive content.  Go see one of the neutral Cirque shows if you arent sure you can handle this one.This show isnt cheap for a reason.  Simply, its worth it.  Spiegelworld has a huge gem here.  This show is epic, and for those who can handle it, you will have an amazing evening at Absinthe.  Whatever you choose to do in Las Vegas, we hope you have a wonderful time!"

The two shows are very similar in format though this one has no storyline to speak of, which is fine. The acts are all jawdropping. Amazing acrobats and feats of strength and so on. Especially loved the bathtub act and the rollerskating finale. They are all acrobatic/dance in nature though with the exception of a single and hilarious comedy routine. I would've liked a little more variety, but that's where Opium excels instead.The humor is aggressively and ruthlessly vulgar. As vulgar as humanly possible. And yes, occasionally racist in nature. You will be offended at some point. And, fun fact, check out the 1 star reviews to see the people who are no fun and hate life. If you think you might be offended, go see one of the wordless Cirque shows instead to preserve your delicate sensibilities.However, skip the bar. The drinks are ludicrously expensive 20 for a single well drink and just not worth it."

While most of the acts are incredibly mouth droppingly entertaining and worth the cost of admission on its own, the hosts of the show, a crass ring bearer and his unfunny side kick, distracted with their classless jokes about gay, black, Hispanic and Asian people who were sitting right in the audience. While  I like to think of myself as having a good sense of humor, I dont believe there is any venue which makes this ok. The fact the theatre was filled with 95 white people seemed to make this extra perverse. On another note. There needs to be stronger warnings for this show. Not just 18 and that its performance art ... Do not sit in the first few rows, Unless you like torturous, unrelenting, jabs thrown at you all night. Do not attend if you dont want to hear very descriptively graphic sexual stories. And of course do not attend if you dont like racist jokes. While this show at its core was fantastic, the rest of the crap just stole from it. Someone needs to tell the show producers that you can be funny and entertaining without being a jerk."

The seating is all very close to the action, so no matter where you sit, you'll have a great view. A lot of people call the show ""crude"". I think it's just good adult fun. If you can't handle some adult jokes and possibly being picked on in front of the audience, then don't go. I read a lot of comments that said the show was ""racist"". For the show I went to, the people that got picked on the most were racist Trump supporters, so I think calling the show racist is just ridiculous. And that's a warning to Trump supporters......leave your MAGA hat at home, or better yet, don't go to Vegas EVER."

I didn't know what I was going to see when my friends got us the tickets, so I was a bit shocked at the jokes. I still thought they were hilarious, but do not go here for a family outing. If you do go as a family outing and you sit in the first 3 rows, you could potentially be the butt of a joke....which everyone will laugh at. Do not go if racist, homophobic, sexual, or political jokes get you upset. Also, don't be the middle aged guy who takes your daughter, because boy are you in for an awkward time.This is amazing talent with a lot of crude humor mixed in. I thought the talent was great and they all performed well. The hosts provide comedic relief between the acts and the jokes get super raunchy. I'm in my mid30s and I thought the jokes were funny, but I could see where someone older or more serious may not appreciate the humor. My only complaint about the show is the venue. We were crammed in like sardines on metal barstools. I was fortunate enough to have a seat with padding but the other 3 folks I was with all sat on metal barstools. That's a long time to be that uncomfortable and right on top of your neighbor. It helps give everyone a great view of the acts but it's a bit too crowded for my taste. There is an outdoor bar and seating area. It was raining when we attended so we went right in and sat down in the tent."

While advertised as unapologetically crude, it went way beyond that in my opinion.  My wife actually enjoyed it but I thought the show depended way to much on being crude and raunchy.

The comedy by the MC and his sidekick assistant is meant to be shocking, raunchy, and totally inappropriate politically, racially, sexually so expect it and dont be offended as its part of the show/act. The ticket prices are expensive, paid with fees etc included about 150/tix and was in the 4th row or so back just behind the VIP section.  The view is fine wherever you are because its a small venue.  Try to get a seat near and aisle as you are packed in very closely.  VIP seats have a cushion on them and are close to the stage but are also in the splash zone for one of the acts.  I enjoyed the show and would recommend seeing it.  "

But this...too often it was just not quite clever enough to transcend being just gross and shocking.

Why do you have to pick out the one Asian lady and make a joke about her doing nails all day, or the one black guy about how big his penis is  Its not funny. Its isolating. And, Its cruel!

The show is in a round, so everyone can see everything, and everyone is close.  It's spectacular.  The tickets are pricey normal for Vegas, honestly and my husband and I would have happily paid more.Now, the two negative points which should not dissuade you from attending you should be aware of: 1 The seats are essentially folding chairs that are ziptied together.  You will be pretty much on top of your neighbour. There is no leg room.  The show is amazing enough that you stop noticing, but if you're claustrophobic, aim for an aisle seat.2 The performers are, again, breathtaking and hilarious.  The MC's are not.  Their ""humour"" ranges from extreme sextalk meant to be shocking, I'm sure, but really just limpingly funny to straight up racist/ homophobic. Stereotypical comments about audience members' race and possible sexualorientation were the backbone of this humour; racist comments were also directed at the performers themselves. Now, before you call me a fragile snowflake, the humour is STALE.  SO LAME.  It's supposed to be shocking, I'm sure, but it's disappointing.  The MC cracked a joke about the last two performers, who happened to be AfricanAmerican, by saying, ""That ends our AffirmativeAction portion of the show.""  AffirmativeActions  Are you kidding me!  Is it 1992 and Andrew Dice Clay is writing the script! The performers deserve a standard of humour that matches their talent.  It's embarrassing."

From the start the show has you in awe of some of the stunts and performances they do.  Some of the raunch was a little over the top I enjoyed it Some of the jokes were a little too political or racial for me.  It would have been funny for one part of the act, but they pointed out the same audience  members over and over throughout the show, making jokes about their race or sexual orientation. They may have been on it for all I know.  At one point we had to put a plastic sheet up because we were in the splash zone.  It smelt like vomit, which was distracting from the show.

The semiimprovised humor of those two brings European clowning into this century, drives the show's energy, and is the cohesion between deathdefying acts makes transitions nonexistent so the show run at an absolutely nonstop, breakneck pace.The humor of those two is part parody, part absurdism, part supersuperdirty no problem there  it works comedically and is ironically ""appropriate"" for the context of this Vegas show... but then it is also part heavily racial.The main actor's audience interaction revolves largely around naming people's races and the wellknown stereotypes thereof. They actors scream out the stereotypes as if being politically incorrect is funny for it's own sake. It is inyourface brashness that plows through the sense one is ""not supposed to say such things"" so incredibly forcefully, and it appears to bend the audience's will unto submission. It taps into a baser level of groupthink catharsis. Uprourias laughter ensues.Here's the problem. Minority individuals selected by the actor from the audience are put in the terrible position of either going along with it  one selected audience member's mimed response as he was pulled onto stage indicated, ""Yup, go ahead and say it, it's true, I am black and haha yup I know the stereotypes about my youknowwhat being big etc etc hahaha.""  or, alternatively, to defy the onstage actor running the show authority role in addition to a hugely revved up audience that has been whipped into a frenzy of ""hilarity."" Putting that onus on the individual takes away their right to to exist as an individual who's not being labeled and thought of in terms of their race. This is a grave infringement on privacy, to say the least. It's a dirty trick, engineered to elicit huge laughs from the audience, which leaves the individual with almost no option to protest. The ""volunteered"" individuals are often unable to even consider protesting this ""comedic"" conceit. They are swept into the attention of being a momentary celebrity, even if a compromised one. The only alternative would be to quickly! build up the strength to publicly act in defiance of the entire audience.The show's directors, producers, and actors need to change this. It is a seriously cheap laugh if ever I saw one. The cheapest, easiest, dirtiest laugh. They're capable of so much more. The two main actors who also strip down and do an incredibly funny parody of the physical acts that compose most of the showtime are young, vibrant, dynamic, creative and top notch in their talent acting, comedy, clowning. They must let go of this crutch  they could so easily find less cheap humor to swap in. They're brilliant.I don't mean a raucous, boundarybreaking show needs to be super careful to protect individual highlighted audience members and walk on eggshells like they can't handle some teasing. Rather, I mean that the comedic conceit of this particular teasing  calling out their race and the stereotypes thereof just for its own sake  is way, way, way too grave an infringement on those individuals, when you take a step back and consider the consequences of that line of thinking and how it has evolved in such relatively recent years and persists today.I'm not calling the show racist. ""Racism"" falls along a nonbinary spectrum and I would hazard to guess these white actors are dynamic and openminded in general, with the ability to assess individuals as individuals much more astutely than the kinds of people one would typically label as ""racist""  and quite possible even much better than average not that average is such a high bar, IMO. However, by participating in this semiscripted show as they do, the actors  and the entire production  demonstrates a outright lack of sensitivity that falls far below the bar as to where public outlets/institutions must stand in this day and age.OTOH, many or most believe stereotypes are funny because they are somewhat true. Therefore, the comedic conceit at hand is not an excercise in laughing at the inanity of stereotypes. Even if there is some factual albeit not usually empirically evaluated reality that would support the claims of a stereotype, stereotypes are not meant to be constructive or helpful, especially to the group being stereotyped. If you don't think stereotypes have an inherent problematic and hurtful side to them, I'm afraid I don't have the space here to change your mind.In principle, it is these two doofus characters who are being insensitive and obtuse, not the actors or show itself. However, that is far from crystal clear  it doesn't scan that way most of the time. The lines are heavily blurred, partly because the characters are directly interacting with the audience. The main guy interacts with the audience just like any other comedian, even if a bit more ""in character"" than your normal standup. As an audience member, you are complicit, even if unwittingly so. The guy's ""right hand woman"" character is more absurd and seems more clearly at the whims of her own dysfunction, so there's a bit more room there to interpret her humor as, ""Haha, look at the socially obtuse head case."" But, with the main character the guy, that is not how the comedy is operating.Some will inevitably defend this form of comic schtick by pointing out that it goes after all races, equally, including poking fun at your typical ""dorky white guy."" That simply does not resolve the inherent problem to loudly proclaiming stereotypes about the minority races black and asian, during the performance I saw, because it's is not a level playing field on which we play; teasing the group in power doesn't evoke the same level of problem, nor does it eliminate the problem inherent to putting a black man on stage and saying, ""Haha, you're our 'black guy' today, we love ya, you must have a huge youknowwhat, haha.""I mean, come on! They don't need to do that. The ensemble is so good and there are so many other ways they could engage the audience. It's a creative show with a creative spirit. Dismiss with this comedian crutch; just engage a bit more of your amazing creativity instead.Clean up your act, Absinthe. Recognize that your racial remarks are truly at the expense of some individuals."

He's a jester who goes after the audience like a terrier after a group of rabbits. He's a dangerous character, all right, but funny as hell. What's really remarkable about Absinthe is the acrobats and performers themselves. The graceful twoman balancing act had my mouth hanging open. The erotic performance of the two aerialists, the lovely South American woman who performed with a hanging hula hoop. That last one appeared onstage in a filmy blouse with something sexy underneath. The first time she hangs upsidedown, the blouse reveals a steampunk bra and panties set that's absolutely gorgeous, as is she.The racial and ethnic jokes were really pretty awful, but the subjects laughed, and so did we. p.s.: The Green Fairy drink really is delicious."

I paid extra for premium seating in the first two rows, which could have been a disaster as my husband and I are shy and would have hated to be pulled onstage.You enter the big top through an outside bar area with plenty of seating. We were told there was a bar inside so we opted for this since it was boiling hot outside. The wait was longer than expected as the bartenders were slow. I'd recommend getting drinks outside to spare you the discomfort of standing in cramped quarters.The tent furnishings are a vintage lovers dream. It's decorated with unique art, vintage furnishings and a dramatic Absinthegreen curtain draped from the center of the top. This is true seating ""in the round"" with circular rows of eclectic bar stools with back support. The first two rows do have chair pads which was a nice touch. However, be warned that if you sit there, you may become one of the ringmaster's targets.About the show  it's best for a VERY mature audience and has several cringeworthy moments. One couple came out with a young college aged son and dad was absolutely mortified by having to hear questionable topics in front of his kid. The announcer makes it abundantly clear that you'll hear all sorts of foul language and vulgarity. No one and no sexual topic is offlimits  you will hear everything. The ringmaster is a bizarre looking dude with a sleazy voice. He singled out some people in the audience, calling them nasty names, coke heads and making suggestive comments. He called out audience members for being gay, Republican, black, Asian, and goofy white guys. Some of the humor made me squirm because of the racial stereotyping; I was uncomfortable and terrified of being roasted. I noticed that the farther you were away from the small central stage, the less likely you'd be targeted. But if you can get past that and aren't offended by this type of comedy, you'll have a great time.The cast is comprised of scantily clad, stripteasing acrobats we're talking pasties here!, mindbending jugglers, trapeze artists and dancers. Water was used three times and we were provided with plastic sheeting so we wouldn't get soaked. Speaking of getting soaked, one of the most unique acts was a hot guy doing the male version of an acrobat working with silks. I've never seen a beautiful man do acrobatics from a clawfoot bathtub full of water  it was mesmerizing! The acts got better as the show progressed, with one of the audience favorites being dancing twin brothers. Their energy and passion was truly inspiring and uplifting. The show ended with a deathdefying roller skating duo and an elaborately staged curtain call. Overall, I'm very happy we went, even if it was just to see my husband laugh for 90minutes. We enjoyed it and I'd highly recommend it."

The humor is very good though it is heavily focused on sex, and to a degree racism, and is quite crude.  I dont mind that as it is a comedy show as well, but it does get a bit old after a while of hearing it nonstop.  I was at VIP table and even that had very little room, and the chairs are rather uncomfortable to sit for an extended period...at the same time the tight seating does allow for a smaller more intimate venue so you can see well from anywhere.  So overall not the most comfortable show to watch, but very entertaining, and choose wisely who you attend with given the overt sexual nature of the comedy."

The cost savings wasnt a lot, maybe 15.00 USD pp basically the Ticketmaster service fee. Essentially you are buying a voucher that you then have to take to the box office of the show before receiving your actual tickets. It was a bit of extra hassle, but with 6 tickets it was worth it. The show itself was great. It is essentially a variety show, but what makes it exceptional are the hosts. They were hilarious, but in a very mature way. If you are easily offended, it wouldnt be the show for you. The 2 hosts are raunchy, crude, a bit racist though every race is open game, and just when they would be pushing the limits on the raunchiness, they would introduce an act to reel you back in. There were acrobats of different types, jugglers, dancers, and singing. There are 2 shows nightly at 8 and 10 pm. There is a bit of crowd interaction, so if it's not your thing then choose seats further back. The venue only sits around 300 people, so all the seats were good. It's probably one of the best shows Ive ever been to, and even one of the guys that came with us who had no interest in it ended up loving it."

Do NOT bring your children. That being said, there was a TON of laughter and the acts in between the comedy were pretty amazing. This really is one of the best shows Ive seen in Vegas. LocationIts right off the strip on the Caesar property. Its just a stones throw away from Gordon Ramseys Hells Kitchen   it was so convenient to make dinner reservations here and then then run on over to the Absinthe tent right before the show.VenueIts a big circus tent. Outside there is a bar and a place to hang out before the show. The VIP people had a separate entrance and got to enter through a telephone booth! The rest of us nonimportant people went through regular glass doors. Inside was not your regular theater seats. It looked like a big bar with seats arranged in a circle, with a small circular platform in the center. The seats were an assortment of folding chairs, bar chairs, etc. You are pretty squished in there so if youre a big gal or guy with long legs or broad shoulders, get an aisle seat or VIP table. For us short people, section 3 row F was pretty good  our seats were taller chairs and they looked over the lower folding chairs. I felt so lucky because sitting on the folding chairs in front of me were some pretty tall guys! I said you may want to get a table, then again, maybe you dont. Table seats are prime for getting picked on by the billionaire and owner host. The first 23 rows in the whole venue were too. You may be verbally and/or physically picked to be the brunt of their joke. I would only dare sit there if you are pretty comfortable with yourself and can take this kind of joke. There are also a couple of acts that spray water on the first 23 rows. You are given plastic to try to cover up for these instances. Dont sit there if you just got a perm!ShowThe format is host, act, host, act, and so on. The acts were great. The feats of strength, balance, artistry were pretty amazing. There stage was the center platform and the air, but they also came out onto the tables. If you bought a table seat, just expect the some of the show to come right in front of your face.The hosts were the billionaire owner of the tent and his assistant. They swore a lot and made a lot of sexual humor jokes. They are the ones that could pick someone out of the audience to pick on them as the brunt of the joke or put certain body parts on them. They are also what helps to make the show so funny and entertaining. We loved it."

We had heard that it was a bit 'out there' in terms of adult content, and not for the faint hearted. It sounded perfect!Firstly the venue itself, in a large tent outside Caesar's Palace, where the chairs are a mix of fold down, old kitchen, stools and assorted others. Nothing matched, and many had been 'decorated' with childish depictions of genitalia or rude words. Even the seating challenges the audience. The stage itself is about 12 feet in diameter, and onto this a string of different performers do their thing. Jugglers, trapeze acts, a semistrip tease, acrobats and all hosted by 'The Gazzilionaire' and his female assistant. These two characters provide the commentary, the vast majority of the swearing, and as much racist, homophobic, antiSemitic and sexually inappropriate content as I have ever heard in a show anywhere. Personally I laughed out loud through most of the show and as long as you keep in mind that this is meant to push your buttons and you must not take any of this seriously, you'll have a blast!

This felt different.  It's almost odd to me that it was Caesars doing this show, since the set is so minimal.  It doesn't have near the production cost of shows like Ka, La Reve, or Love.

We were sat next to a black couple and I could feel how awkward they were feeling it was so unnecessary.

It can be uncomfortable, but then it is 'edge of the seat' acrobatics and errr, comedy. I was warm in there. I'm glad I went to the toilet before the show started.I found the performers, mesmerising at times. The acrobatics were excellent, even mind boggling. I particularly liked the stacked chair routine at the start, but the other acts were also very, very good.Now for the bad and sad bit. I'm not an easily offended person and I did find myself laughing, but not at the ridiculously crude, mostly disgusting and immature trash that came out of the mouths of both the male and female host 'double act'. I was actually laughing at them, and not in a good way. Quite simply, they weren't in any way 'funny'. I'm sure they realise most people are laughing at them purely in embarrassment. They clearly think their gross humour is 'edgy' and 'out there'. It certainly isn't, it's rude, crude and utterly offensive to I suspect, the vast majority of ordinary people.In short, if vulgar, sexually, racially and politically offensive material mixed in with some stunning acrobatics floats your boat, then this show is for you. If you're in any way easily offended or just don't want to listen to some absolute toilet trash alternative 'comedy', stay away."

I never looked at my watch once during the 90 minutes, which few by too fast. The tent/theater gives you a great seat, even in the back, but loved my seats in G15.This is an adult show, so no kids should come , and I'm not sure they even allow them.  Humor is adult, racist, sexy, and if that bothers you, skip the show.  Talent is amazingand the women are very talented...and built just the way I like themathletic. The ringmaster is hilarious and is just as amazing as all of the acts.  It is fast paced and because you are sitting right on top of the action, it is as if you are part of the show.....which some of you will be. Only drawback are the chairsnot at all comfortable, but hey, they fit the circus tent theme.  Oh..and alcohol...pretty expensive. A definite must see for anyone who wants to laugh, be amazed by hot talented performers or can't get tickets to a Cirque show....which this easily rivals."

It was a good show, but be prepared for sexual, political, and racial jokes. We went there specifically to see Billy and Emily England, and they did not disappoint, nor did any of the performers. This show was amazing, every act was impressive. My only complaints are the tiny, folding chairs. We paid over 300 for 2 tickets to sit in the front row and were a little disappointed when we saw the seats. The other issue was the fact that even if you buy your tickets in advance online, you still have to stand outside in the box office/will call line to pick up your tickets. It was windy and cold the night we went, and the line was long so that part wasn't very enjoyable. Overall, we had a great time! If you don't mind being part of the show and getting a little wet during some acts, I would say spend the extra money and sit in the front rows."

The show takes place mostly on a 9' stage in the center of a small circus tent. There is a bar inside serving a selection of pricey drinks. We went to the late show and they just let us walk in with our drinks in hand, so there was no need to purchase more inside. I've seen most of the Cirque shows in Las Vegas, and this has a much more intimate feel. We were in the 4th row, and I felt at times, if something went wrong, some of the acts could go flying into our row. I've read quite a few reviews and it seems like some of the acts have changed over the years, but the current entertainment is first class. The rollerskating duo was fantastic, and I've never been a fan of juggling, but these guys were unbelievable.  I do wish I'd seen Melody Sweets as the green fairy.There has been criticism of this show being racist and I think people are highly confused. There are portions of this show that contain satirical racism, which in the style of the great Mel Brooks is used to show how stupid racism is. If you don't like satire, or are an advocate for all things PC so see a different show. My wife didn't know we were going to this show until the day of. I didn't want her to know too much of what to expect, and she was blown away."

The show is put on in a tent in front of Ceasars and the seats or stools, folding chairs are all of different shapes and sizessome folks complained about the seats being uncomfortableI thought they were fine.  What makes this show adults only are the masters of ceremonies who are lewd and crude and definitely not PC.  Every racial group is made fun of, the female MC is referred to as a ""retard"", and sexual jokes meant to shock are objectify are never ending.

The athletes were definitely a 5 star show. So, why a 1 star rating The show is incredibly racist and meanspirited. Bringing up a fat guy from the audience to pick on. Constantly picking on the 2 guys sitting together with homophobic jokes running throughout the show. Bringing up an Asian woman with old, tired Chinese jokes. Putting down the black guy. Jewish jokes. You were bound to be in one of the groups put down. Is it funny when you are not in the group and not funny when it is your group I don't find putting down a group with old jokes to be funny. People have said that it is raunchy. The raunchy/sexy I can handle. It is the racist, sexist, homophobic jokes that constantly go on between the acts that I did not find funny at all. Get a new comic and the show is 5 stars."

So be ready to be friendly with your neighbors. There isn't any space between your knees and the chairs in front of you so be prepared to stand up to let people in and out of the row. They hosts used fowel language and and racial jokes. They also had a few conversations that were sexual in nature that went on a bit too long.  The white ladies in front of me laughed at the racial jokes, but gave the stare of death to the sexual ones.  That cracked me up. Racists who had high morals. Right!  The acts were impressive and the brother and sister roller skatinf act from America's Got Talent performed. if you don't like cramped spaces you may not like this place. if you can't handle raunchy sex talk, stay away."

The stage is a small circular area in the centre. The chairs are mismatched fold up chairs that are very close together.

The host and hostess were just way over the top for my sensibilities and I cringed at the level of sexual vulgarity.  Besides that, I was in a folding chair with no padding jammed between a long legged man and a very large man.  Halfway through the performance, my leg cramped from being unable to stretch.  If you go, be prepared for racial and sexual humor perhaps directed at you personally, and you may get wet."

The early century styled circus tent adds to the unique styled show sprinkled with sexy burlesque, some funny crude humor and attractive talented acrobatic artists and acts.The bad: I don't mind paying 100 seat even with a military discount, for the 4th row there are no bad seats, but only the first 3 rows get pillows on the assorted folding chairs, some are wood. Beyond the 3rd row, just a folding chair tied tightly together, no cushion. You are scrunched together with your neighbor for a solid 90 minutes. Most of the clientele are slender,  hip, beautiful creatures dressed to the nines, which doesn't change anything but it's not your average type of crowd. The jokes cross all racial and sexual lines, making certain chosen people in the first 3 rows the butt of all jokes throughout the show black, asian, white people labeled as republicans like that's a bad thing, dorky people, people labeled as lesbians...no one left out. I work in a casino commercial kitchen and my husband a retired Navy fleet chief and are no means offended by crude sexual natured jokes by the ringmaster and his nympho side kick. We get it's just the act. I guess we don't find continuous humor in repetitive xxx rated jokes, literally verbal porn, very funny. We leave that to comedians like Kathy Griffin and Amy Schumer. Again by all means we are not prudes in the least bit. I guess thats what people think is funny. If you pay to be in the VIP area be prepared for the ushers to drape you in plastic occasionally to keep from getting wet depending on the act, and you just might get the bonus of becoming the butt of the 90 minute ongoing joke. If that's what you want to spend your money on. I've been to many cirque du soleil types of shows, and they make sure to include a few of the hanging silk/strap performers. Again, cool to see but you've seen one you've seen them all. At least I felt I got my money's worth seeing the Jersey Boys and Steve Wynn's Show Stoppers but didn't feel I got 100 value in this show."

Also the Circus Tent Venue allowing for good seating locations anywhere as it is a performance in the round.The Bad I mean very bad. The seats are mostly various types of folding chairs crammed in almost on top of each other. They are very hard and little ""breathing room"". The ""raunchy"" language is used, I think, to promote the show. Spoken by your male and female MC's, the language is sexual, genderbias, and racial in nature does little in my opinion to embellish the show and actually may detract from the great acrobatic performances you will see."

Small, but OK and well air conditioned it was the hottest week in history of LV when I visited. The sitting is quite uncomfortable. Almost all the seats offer the same visibility; the first two rows are splash rows for one act only. I got the most expensive VIP ticket, which gave me a seat at a table but on an uncomfortable tall chair, and a bottle of what they call ""champagne"", but is in fact an extremely poor sparkling wine.The show is a combination of comedy and acrobatics. I found the comedy part horrible nevertheless, most of the audience was laughing out loud. All the jokes were dirty and/or racist. Not clever jokes, though. Humor was replaced by constant swearing as if that is funny by itself. For instance, the host labelled three men in the front row as gay, and kept telling ""jokes"" about them throughout the show  what they like to do to each other, what will happen in their hotel room after the show, etc. It was not funny, but pathetic.The acrobatics part of the show was better, but far, far below the standards of for example CDS. The stage is very small, so this is one of the limits for sure. The costumes and the scene are what you would expect in a circus, without an extra something. There is no nudity despite the ""adult"" label, and if a barechested girl in one of the acts is what you are looking for, then I am sure there are plenty of far better alternatives in Vegas.One act though was by my opinion inventive, fresh, and something new  the girl and the balloon dance. Absolutely not enough to justify the 150 I paid for the ticket. I really regret visiting the show, again due to extremely poor humor."

Absinthe presents a rare combination of greasy carny barker with breathholding feats of acrobatic talent in a very intimate tent setting.  Don't take children unless they need to learn every bad word in one setting.  My best buddy from high school came up so I got us VIP seating.  We were given a special VIP entrance through a limegreen tardis British phone booth Dr. Who style and a free selection of water or champagne.  Each chair in this tent is different and there are not a lot  so this is not an arena.  There is a small section of tables, which is what I got us. The lighting and staging is eclectic and from a bygone era, which adds to the sensory delight. The master of ceremonies is fantastically caustic and sharpwitted!  His gold tooth, awful and greasy haircut, gold jacket and shoes are perfect.  He slices and dices all races, genders, political affiliations. He has a young hyper woman sidekick who cannot stop talking about everything sexual that comes to her mind without filter.  After talking to two Jewish people about the cuts they'd see in the men's spandex, he told them if they didn't believe him to just ask the two gay guys sitting behind them  me and my buddy!  OMG!  Then the sidekick goes on a long diatribe about all the gay sex we're having.  I cried it was so fricken funny!  But it's not all racist or sexist humor.  The performers are truly talented acrobats that deliver some great and conceptual performances.  At times, the tables we sat at were used by the performers.  At times the audience is the performers.  This is no Cirque show!  But all I can say is GO!  Be prepared to be dazzled and possibly offended at the same time!  Great Vegas fun!"

This one is a MUST SEE. But, if you don't have a good sense of humor, are easily offended, aren't comfortable with profanity, racial jokes/stereotypes, sexual innuendos, and things of that sort, this show isn't for you."

The performers in all of the acts are so talented and it was all amazing.  Rollerskating on a 8' round stage in center; the aerial acts that go so high and spin so fast; I had to cover my eyes a number of times it seemed what they were doing was scary dangerous; the girl with the balloon.  The music was beautifully done.   I thought it was going to be sort of silly burlesque acts and it was so much more than that.  It was just amazing talent and I am so glad I went.  The Gazillionaire does pick on the audience and it was funny to me but he didn't pick on me.  The first three rows around the stage are wet zones.  Enjoy!!"

If you sit near the front, you had better be prepared:  The MC will insult your appearance/race/sexual preference, etc.  It's very primitive stuff black men dance better and are bigger beneath the belt, people with dark complexions are terrorists, Asian women all say ""me so horny"", and the small gay man is ""the bh"" in the relationship. I'm not really that PC, but it just wasn't smart comedy.  If you are a minority and sit near the front, you should expect racist comments. You will also get sprayed by water including some spit by the acrobat it you sit up front, although they give you plastic to hold up during the act.  We sat in row two, and I got a sore neck from looking up. I definitely wished I had sat in one of the couches further back.   The acrobats were good, but nothing that I hadn't seen before in Cirque shows.  The setting is very much like Teatro Zinzanni although I likedTeatro much better than this. "

The comedy is racist, sexist and raunchy so be prepared to blush if this is not your kind of thing. The acrobats are good some of the acts are really awesome.

The show emcee started the show with a monologue if you are insulted easily or don't tolerate sexually explicit, demeaning or racist comments, this is not the show for you. We generally found the show to be funny, but several times I thought it crossed the line by targeting individuals in the audience and commenting on them an Asian woman was selected and he started speaking to her with an Asian accent making demeaning comments. He moved to a bunch of guys and started calling them the gay guys throughout the show. He selected an African American couple near us and started making comments about them in the back of the theatre and another interracial couple, commenting on them. The couple near us was so uncomfortable, they got up and left. It was ""all in fun"" BUT it was very uncomfortable. Once they had the acts they were great. The seats are unbearably uncomfortable the main bowl seating is folding chairs linked together with zip ties. If you are tall, make sure you have an aisle. If you go, sit at tables in back. Only sit in front if you really want to be picked on by the emcee. It's a good show, make sure you consider where you sit and go in with very thick skin!!

I would recommend when booking your seats to get a table or an aisle seat. I saw a bigger guy stuck between his girlfriend and another bigger lady on the other side of him. He looked miserable during the performance because he was all scrunched up and looked to be having a hard time finding a comfortable position.

If you are offended by graphically sexual or racist humor, or political correctness is important, go see something else.  For everyone else, Absinthe is a wonderfully funny mix of comedy, acrobatics, and dance.Absinthe is held in a little tent at the front of Caesars Palace.  The circular stage where everything happens is probably 15 feet in diameter, and the seats start right at the edge of the stage.  There are probably 10 rows of seats so you are really close to the action no matter where you sit.  The seats are a collection of random folding chairs, so its cramped and not necessarily comfortable, but its part of the overall underground vibe.  The tent itself is air conditioned, so it was not uncomfortable even in the 100degree heat that we experienced.The show itself is a mix of the aforementioned outrageous comedy, acrobatic acts of balance and strength, and some dance routines.  What really stood out for me is how close you are to the action; it lends an excitement and immediacy that you dont get when you go to a large stage production like any of the Cirque shows.  There are some amazing performers in Absinthe.Finally, if you dont mind being part of the show, go ahead and sit in the first few rows  you will be picked on mercilessly.

The jokes might sound a bit rude or racist if you don t understand their humour. I loved it particularly.

Comedic routines still have me laughing days later. Intimate setting.The humor is quite vulgar and liberal, so if that's not you're thing, I don't recommend it. Plenty of sex lots!, politics and racial jokes get thrown around. Very funny!Seating is a bit crammed and uncomfortable, but manageable. They set up fold out chairs in a circle around the stage and a few table clusters on the top layer. We sat in the last row of the main section before the table clusters, and it was great.

It's the fact that such discrimination has given rise to hatred, conflicts, and wars around the world. Such bigotry and judgment is the cornerstone of Absinthe's comedy and I loved every second of the show. The refreshing comedic stance of stepping into the unholy and disapproving subject matters,I believe, is what makes it draw crowds from all corners of the planet. Everyone likes a taste of the forbidden fruit. The comedy is intertwined and alternate between skits, jokes, and amazing acrobatics. Even if one cannot appreciate the crude, adult humor, there's no denying of the talent and skill the physical performers have. From displaying raw strength, to high wire balancing acts, each and every performer will surprise you and have you on the edge of your seat. The venue is under a small outdoor tent outside Caesar's and seating is comprised of ziptied foldout chairs. Don't fret if you have a seat near the rear and cannot fully see the stage; the majority of the acts and performances will be at an elevated level. Be warned, seats at the front may not be best for shy folks given that there are in a splash zone and the scurrilous MC tends to pick those closest to the stage.  All in all, if you're looking for something that's different and enjoy raunchy humor, Absinthe will be your type of entertainment. It's a refreshing change from the typical Vegas shows and will make you die laughing and feeling dirty at the same time."

If you are picking up tickets prior to the show, the box office is outside by the tent as well.  For the show  the best way I can describe it is white trash cirque.  Seriously.  But in a good/fun way.  I've seen all of the Cirque shows, as this was my 20th trip to Vegas.  The seats for this show are random, small, garage sale/old school desk type seats.  Don't expect to be comfy.  They are ziptied together too so you will be elbow to elbow with the person next to you.  Don't let this steer you away by any means, it is part of the experience.  They have some very talented acts in this show.  The host is very vulgar, racist, dirty,  raunchy and will pick on everyone in the front row so it makes for LOTS of laughs.  If you get offended easily, this show probably isn't for you.  For instance, he was picking on the ""trophy wife"" sitting up front and called her up to the stage.  He also pulled out a token white guy from the audience and a black male from the audience to give this girl a lap dance.  She then had to touch the crouch of the guy she thought did the best dance.  The guy and girl on the skates are amazing.  The strength of the talented artists are top notch.  It's cirque talent set to modern and fun music.  Give it a shot.  You will love it.

Don't be shy to nudity or a little racism although they do it with class and no one seems to be offended I said to my Aunt when we left this show ""If everyone could just sit back and laugh at themselves....black...white...indian...asian....catholic....protestant...tall....short,well you get my drift. If we could all laugh at ourselves and not take everything so seriously in the world....I think we'd be so better off. Everyone is so sensitive about everything now days it makes me sad.

Most of the acts had a real wow factor, amazing stuff.  Be warned though that the humor is very raunchy and there's a few racial jokes too so if you're easily offended this show isn't for you. I'd also recommend not sitting in the first two rows as you're more likely to get picked on as is the case with most ad lib comedians. The venue is a little odd, a fairly small circus tent with folding chairs to sit in but once the show starts it seems to work just fine."

But we couldn't have been more disappointed in the show. First of all, you walk in a tent and it just has a grungy feel. You are scrunched together in fold up chairs with nowhere to move. The narrator was so vulgar and so disgusting it was offensive. I can take a joke and I can take curse words, but if it takes 20 minutes to do one act because you're too busy yelling out cursewords and racial slur's, this isn't the show for you. The acts were good but nothing compared to Cirque du Soleil. I would much rather see a show like that where music is played in the background in a nice theatre than the awful narrative in a shabby tent. My husband and I walked out of the show probably 30 minutes into it. If you thinking about buying tickets, think twice, save your money and definitely upgrade to Cirque du Soleil. You will be extremely disappointed if you choose this show and atmosphere."

But I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. I had been warned not to go if we were easily offended. We are not at all, but it even pushed my limits at times. And at other times I was laughing so hard my face hurt!  There are some very good acrobatic acts some quite erotic, but I would have preferred to have seen more of those and less of the show hosts. The theatre was nice and small, under a tent. We had been told there were no bad seats because of the size. However when we booked our seats we were pointed out sections where it would be more difficult to see because there would be posts in front of us. Even with the ""good seats"" we ended up having to move over because of a post in the way!  We were in the back row, which was fine for a view since it is such a small venue. Definitely don't sit in the first few rows of you don't want to picked on. Especially if you are from a visible nonCaucasian or nonstraight group. And if you are easily offended by racist, homophobic, sexist jokes, don't go. All in all, it was okay, but I have to say that I do regret spending that much money on it. In retrospect, we probably should have gone to Cirque du Soleil's ""Zoomanity"" if we wanted something more risqu."

The 18 show is filled with offensive humour and classic circus acts under the big top. Would not recommend it to anyone who is easily offended as the ""host"" does poke fun at most of the audience with racial and homophobic jokes tasteful of course. Had the biggest smile on my face the whole night and could not stop laughing! Will definitely come and see it again! The only downside was the seating as the seats are set up on a flat surface as opposed to most shows on the strip set in a theatre where the rows elevate. Was unfortunate enough to be sitting behind and incredibly tall person and had to move side to side to see some acts, however most of the acts do take place in the air and can be seen from most seats."

If you are offended by cursing, racism, sexism, homophobism, explicit descriptions of sex acts, etc., etc. you probably won't want to attend this show. If you enjoy raunchy and offensive humor, you'll probably scratch that, definitely love it.The show lasts about 2 hours and drinks were spendy at 20/split of champagne, obvs. Every seat in the house has a great view ... as others have said those in the first few rows should be prepared to be picked on.

For some the MC and his interplay with the audience especially those seated in the front row  may be considered rude and racist.  He is the entertainment as the acts transition on to the stage.  The tent is small with a quirky old 50's circus tent feel.  Seats are varied and can be anything from a wooden folding chair to a bathtub or barber chair. There is not a bad seat in the house as there are only about ten rows from the stage.  If you book ahead  those at the back are a little more comfortable.  We we are T19 a table for two with a great view.  The acts are circus like extraordinary performances of strength, talent and dare devil thrills, with many omg moments. My favorite were the two ""bodyguards"" who blew my mind with their strength, physicality and performance that is almost a ballet of slow motion muscle."

Absinthe is over at Ceasars total rewards.  My aunt saw it and recommended it so we went.We did manage to get the 20 off coupons in front of the box office so two tickets set us back right at 200.Pro tip: front row I am sure is awesome, though you are a target for the jokes.  In my opinion, row K is actually the best.  It is the edge of the back but you get lots of leg room and now one in front of you.  I did not feel any closer would have been better.The jokes and humor is very adult.  Be very comfortable with cursing, sex, racial jokes, looks, scatological references.....it's hilarious.  It is adult.The stunts are very cool and interesting.The performers all have perfect bodies and are lovely to look at while they defy death.

We had a blast. As one half of an interracial couple, I was actually a bit nervous going in due to the if you dont have a thick skin dont go comments. But it really wasnt bad at all. My husband and I love stand up and weve been to a lot of shows were the comics were much worse. But I suppose, if you really are sensitive you wont enjoy it. I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes. Heres the other thing, the comedic aspect of the show served more as transitions between acts. The hosts would do the intro and introduce the acts. The main attraction, which really was spectacular are the performers. All the acts were wonderful and the small intimate venue made it that much more aweinspiring. I also found all the staff to be extremely helpful.  The time just flew by and I was a tad sad when it all finished.  I like to ensure my reviews always keep the spirit of trip advice so here goes: 1. The tent really is very small as everyone has said those middle seats all tied together looked cramped and uncomfortable. Per the reviews, we opted for seats in the back which I highly recommend. We had a little table for our drinks and what looked to be comfier chairs. It is also a little raised so no trying to see over people's heads. The tent is so small I feel like calling it the back is misleading as you are still really close to the stage. No bad seats here.  2. Another reason to sit in the back is often people in the front are held up when going to the bathroom or to get drinks. Depending on the act the staff may stop you and you may not be allowed to walk up the isle until an act gets going. 3. So if I say the back is close then VIP is REALLY close. Sit here with the expectation that something will be thrown on you or youre going to be picked on. Wigs, tops, glitter.some people dont mind this but just be mindful. 4. The closest bathroom is across the way  basically not in the tent. So timing is key. I would recommend going right before things start so you dont miss anything. 5. There is bar outside and I think one inside that sells drinks typical Vegas prices and popcorn 6. We went to the 8pm show and the outside bar opened around 7:15ish and the doors opened at 7:30. 7. Box office to pick up tickets is separate from the Caesars box office and is located right outside the tent. 8. Not for kids. Adult content both expressed and implied. Go have fun! Enjoy"

""We"" I should say. My wife and I went to this show last Wednesday evening, our last night in L.V. Our friends from MI went a couple nights earlier, and liked it. In general, I'd say its in line with the other ""variety"" shows we have see in Vegas. Performers seem a little less polished though. Their skills are of course, amazing, and I would not take anything away from them. As my wife likes to say ""they demonstrate the peak abilities of the human body"". The rest of it is pretty crass. No actual clever or sophisticated humor at all, basically toilet humor. the whole damned show. Throw that in with some pasties and I guess that is enough for people. I would say its a 40 show. The humor, as it were, was designed to make people uncomfortable and squeamish.  Highly successful at that. If you are into that, 120 for a tent with little actual humor, lots of toilet humor, racist and sexist commentary to the max! and some pretty good performers this might be up your alley. We found it pretty disappointing. I only gave it two stars for the performers, and their athletic ability and obvious dedication to their craft. That is incredible stuff. That being said, if you are here reading reviews, and you still go, then you will probably be fine; We wish we would have done so..Cheers!"

I'm glad I did because it was definitely a sold out show and we picked our seats. The seating is super cramped, but that added to the ambience and feel of the show. Don't be afraid to pick the seats on the outer perimeter. You'll have much more leg room. Be prepared for tap dancers to dance on your table though!

If you decide to attend think about spending the extra money for a VIP table. The chairs around the stage are ziptied together and you are on top of the person next to you whether you like it out not.

The stage is very small and raised in the centre of a tent. Seating is on free chairs surrounding the stage and there isn't much room.

I'm still not sure how no one was killed but that speaks to how incredible the performers are. The final tight rope act is a little weak but maybe that's just because the rest of the show was so amazing. Advice: sit in the back row. All the seats up close are fold out chairs and cramped. Anyone in the first three rows is game for being called a racial slur and picked on by the comedian host...or being killed by a flying foot or chair...But definitely go.

We had very little knowledge of the show and simply chose to go based on TripAdvisor ratings and the proximity to our hotel. I will start by saying the show is funny, witty in a most politically incorrect and often offensive way. If you have a low tolerance for stereotypical racial jokes, jokes of an explicit sexual nature this is probably not for you. Otherwise you can expect a nicely balanced variety show where the performers stage acts are creatively introduced in the fictional ""Spigelworld"" setting.  The individual acts may not be the very very best that Vegas had to offer but they are all quite amazing and incredible to watch. The circus tent venue has a very ""1800's"" feel so the entire theatre becomes part of the act. It's quite cool.  I did hear quite a few spectators voice frustration and disappointment about the actual seats which are an eclectic variety of folding chairs and other wooden chairs, but I actually thought they enhanced the setting. Bottom line is there is not a bad seat in the house. A word if warning if you are the shy type do not sit in the first two rows. There could be a very high likelihood that you will find yourself part of the act or the recipient of some fairly funny but none the less demeaning jokes. If you take that stuff in stride go for it sit in the front row and enjoy.   "

But I did... Very funny. Also the acts are true Vegas standard and all in a very small intimate quirky circus tent. If you're offended by bad taste jokes and the 'F' word then don't go. Otherwise this is truly a totally different amazing show not to be missed. "

Not a show to go to if you are easily offended by fowl language or racism but you will laugh your head off  also be blown away by the talent of the acts.  Personally I hate fowl language but because I had been warned what to expect I was prepared for it.  This show is absolutely hillarious  I would recommend you go  see it.

If you're offended by raunchy humour involving graphic sex, racial slurs, and political incorrectness, this show is not for you.My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed this show  a great change from Cirque du Soleil. They pack you into a little tent outside of Caesar's Palace, and from there the show is a mix of acrobatics, burlesque, and inyourface, dirty comedy. I love that they are as inappropriate as possible  and incorporate the audience. We were sitting in the 4th row, and the performances are right there. I'm talking about tightrope walkers literally right over your head.I would probably not recommend this show to my parents, although there were some in their 50's and 60's  the target audience is 21 and most seemed to be in their 30's."

This show is a quaint, racist, offensive, rather unique, hilarious, one of a kind event that takes place under the big tent! I had so much fun and was constantly laughing almost to the point of crying! If possible, I would totally go see this show again!

I am SO GLAD we did! It was so, so, so, so much fun ... my husband loved it.  We were amused even before the show even started because everyone we met felt they needed to ""warn"" us about the nature of the show  the adult theme, the language, etc  we felt we'd be in for something totally crazy with all the warnings no worries  we are WELL over 21 years old and can handle whatever is thrown at us, LOL.  It was totally unusual from the moment we stepped inside their tent  super intimate, seating VERY close together, well themed kind of depressioneraish circus revue ish. Can't explain it.  It was hysterically funny, very much so.  It was completely crude, rather raunchy,  and definitely not for the prudes but it was so funny.  And amazing athletic acrobatics  wow.  Incredibly talented performers.  A bit of burlesque, some oldschool striptease, humour, acrobatics, music, dancing ... really, it had it all and I'd most definitely see it again and highly recommend it.  Except if you are easily offended by sex/racial/political humour  then stay away,  Everyone else: go!"

We purchased the VVIP tickets and paid 146 each for the best seats in the house.No, we were not on the front row where you will very likely be the target of racial, sexist, homosexual or other offensive jokes throughout the show. We were seated on a raised platform in section A. Not only did we have a great view the theater is very small but we weren't packed in like sardines on very narrow folding chairs!!! Our section had a small table between two chairs so we had space to breathe. If you purchase the basic seats in the house, be prepared to be shoulder to shoulder and hip to hip with other guests.I witnessed a 6'4 very large black man trying to figure out where to put his arms when the 200lb woman sat down next to him! Everyone looked squished unless you happen to be very small.I do not want to discount the talent of the performers, but since the tickets to Absinthe are the same price as some of the more amazing productions, I would recommend spending the money on a different show."

Some of the acts were fantastic.  Some were just okay.  The cohost Penny Pibbets played a hilarious character, mostly poking fun at her own eccentricities.  Then there's the The Gazillionaire  a grumpy, aging, foulmouthed, jerk.  He's very amusing when doing parodies of Cirque or teasing the other performers.   It is even worth a few chuckles when he pokes fun at gays, lesbians, Asians, blacks, and nerdy white guys. That's his character, after all.  We can all suspend being politically correct and have a good time.  But his merciless, nonstop homophobic and racist humor gets old when he picks on the same few people in the audience the entire show.  It isn't necessary, even for this character.  For us, it detracted from the show and eventually made us want to leave.  That's a shame, because there are plenty of ways to keep the humor going without bullying the same few audience members the entire show.  That part was a total failure of imagination and creativity."

Terrific fun and talent on display. The hosts were hilarious, very rude, noholds barred and don't sit at the front if you are easily offended or don't want to be picked on! Super strong and sexy performers from around the world; acrobats, muscle men, tightrope walkers, burlesquestyle dancing. Very entertaining all round; this is essentially a series of standard circus acts presided over by a foul mouthed compere and his sexobsessed assistant. Highlight was the comedy double act performing a routine badly, low light probably the female singer who was a little weak. Some audience members were offended at the very sexual and racist hosting we thought it was hilarious!!!"

Wow what a surprise.  The variety of the acts and uniqueness was incredible.Now for the helpful advice that all of our reviews provide:1.  The venue is a small tent that is located in front of Caesar's Palace hotel.  Being small and that it is a tent and round almost any seat is a great seat.  The almost phase is because of the front row seats.  If you get nervous about having roller skates coming by your head maybe 3 feet away going about 20 mph than do not go front row.2. The MCs host and hostess for the Absinthe are incredibly funny, but it is very adult, sexual and racist/political humor.  Note the racist humor is not directed at any race ALL are equally made fun of.3. There seminude performers.Enjoy  It is one show we would see twice!"

I enjoy listening to Andrew Dice Clay, or anything the south park creators do.  So when the Gazillionaire started making racist jokes, at first it was funny. But then he probably spent about 10 minutes making fun of this poor woman in the front row for being asian. One joke, fine. two jokes, even better.  10 minutes of joke, annoying.  The performers themselves were great.  The tap dancers and the bodyguards were the highlights for me and my wife.  The singing was mediocre.  The show would be great without the host.  I advise strongly not sitting in the front two rows if you don't want to be repeatedly made fun of.  If i could turn back time, i would go see a different show."

This is not for the easily offended.  But for everyone else it's hilarious.  The chairs are horribly uncomfortable and are too close together.  Drinks are way overpriced.  So I recommend you get the seating at the back of the tent at a table, is so small you can see everything from there, have some drinks somewhere before you go, and bring your own bottle of water if it's hot out.

The tent where the show is held is adorable and convenient as it is on Caesar's property. But it turned out  the show was a mixture of amazing talent and horrendous cohosts. The acrobats were mindboggling, the stripper/singer/dancers were adorable and talented. THe tap dancers were world class and the tightrope walkers were great. HOWEVER, between each of these acts, a man and his female cohost came out and did the raunchiest, nastiest routines I have ever heard. Besides the fact that she constantly pretends to be playing with herself, the banter is vulgar and demeaning.  It is not dirtyfunny, it is disgusting. The racial and sexual orientation remarks to members of the audience are embarrasing and overthetop horrible. I never saw so many grown men squirming in their seats, with a look of horror on their faces. I feel sorry for the talented acst who perform here that they are associated with such an opposite barrage.

The performers were very talented and had you at the edge of your seat during some of the acts. The host was picking on people, and he was making racist jokes, so if you aren't into hearing that kind of stuff I'd say skip it. I didn't enjoy those jokes and prayed to God he didn't pick on me. Being that worried does not exactly make a show enjoyable. Several couples and groups of people did walk out though when he was picking on different ethnicities which speaks for itself. The performers made the show though  we didn't know what to expect  and honestly didn't have an opinion on it until the next morning. We all agreed the host crossed the line and was highly inappropriate at times but also very funny at times."

My wife and I caught the Saturday night early show back in late February, and boy did we enjoy it, I was a little concerned because my wife is a little conservative, but I haven't seen her laugh that loud and that much in a long time.  We still repeat some of the lines we heard, and we both almost start crying with laughter all over again. Performances are breath taking, and the performers are beautiful both female and male. It's a great adult evening, sexy, racy, and just downright fun, I highly suggest, and both my wife and I agree that we will definitely see it again. Not a bad seat in the house, but we did notice that the first few rows were picked on a bit more, but I found that the seats a little bit away from the center were a bit better because you didn't have to have your head tilted up as much.

Here's a test:  Do you get slightly embarrassed when Viagra commercials are shown on TV  If your answer is ""yes""  DO NOT go to this show.  There is enough vulgar, raunchy, racist humor in this show to last a lifetime.  The thing that saves this show from itself is that everyone is equally insulted.  I won't rewrite what others have written...it's all true and it's a great show if you have thick skin.  A little about the venue:  It's quite small and decorated to look like a ramshackle circus.  It's kind of like your great, grandmothers attic threw up and it all landed inside this tent.  The most important advice I can offer  and don't be offended by this, it's for your own good  if you are overweight, call the ticket office for seating advice.  The chairs are a mishmash collection of old folding chairs one right next to the other.  Skinny people are wedged in like sardines.  Most of the chairs are HARD.  You will not be comfortable but you will be laughing so hard you will forget that your butt hurts.  There are a few chairs around the upper rim of the theater that could be better for a larger person.  But from a view standpoint, I don't think there is a bad seat in the house.  There are probably only 20 rows from front to back.  You are VERY close to the action."

The MC and his female sidekick, however, are broadly and pointlessly crude and racist with no wit at all. At one point I noticed people leave.  This is the point in my original Tripadvisor review where I laid out in simple, clean language, using one legal term, the gist of a particularly crude riff that the female sidekick addressed to a male audience member as a faux remembrance of a disordered relationship, in order to give you the true flavour of the lack of wit practiced in this show.  The word picture violates Tripadvisor's guidelines, however, and they have a point, as the imagine she painted of destruction and violation sticks in my head. The racial ""comedy"" ran on the lines of black men have large penises and white men aren't able to  dance in a manner sexually enticing enough for Asian women.  Not at all entertaining.

We waited 2 days, anticipating a wonderful night. We were paying quite a bit more than for other shows we had seen this trip.  We were incredibly disappointed.  The comics running the show used extremely racist comments over and over again that would offend just about every person in the audience. There was absolutely no ambiance to enjoy. The ""seating"" included ancient folding chairs and the ""building"" was similar to old drafty barns. My companion pointed out that one chair must have been salvaged from a church as it had a ""kneeler"" mechanism on the back.  We did arrive about 5 minutes late, the show had already started and they GAVE OUR SEATS AWAY!  We paid quite a lot for those seats, and instead were told that we were getting an ""upgrade"".  The ""upgraded"" seats were extremely uncomfortable and the legroom almost nonexistent.  I made a point to go check out the seats we paid for, which had a much better view and more leg room.  If I could have read a review like this one, I would not have wasted my time.  The acrobats were pretty good, but we did not really enjoy our seats, we finally got up and moved.  The comics continued racist humor detracted during key portions of the acrobats performances.  All in all, I would NOT recommend wasting your vacation dollars to see this show.  Instead, try some of the higher caliber LV shows that are thoughtfully designed for the audience's comfort and enjoyment.  As the MC joked, you have to be really drunk to enjoy Absinthe and if you are sober the experience is excruciating.  My opinion is that he wasn't really joking!"

It is at Caesars  but actually outside of the front entrance . It is in a heated tent and in the round. The area is certainly intimate and not a bad seat in the house. However, the seats are old metal chairs sort of tied together, and they are not comfortable .  They state that if you are a prude or thin skinned or easily offended this is not the show for you . It was a fair warning. I tended to like the not politically correct attitude displayed by the emcee and his female co host . Refreshing actually in these times when the most blandest statement seems to spark a lawsuit.  It is sort of like a circus with act after act, coming to the small center stage . The acts, everything from tight rope walkers to tap dancers and some super gymnastic type routines, certainly do entertain. Each act lasts just a few minutes with some off color bantering by the Emcee in between acts .  He can be very funny and his off color racial remarks are spead across all skin tones equally . There is a good amount of skin on display but the pasties are in place . The mockery of the Cirq shows was a very funny routine .   Paid just over 100 per seat, not sure its worthy of that price but it seems to command the price and there are never any specials run for any discounts that I have seen."

I've seen at least 5 Cirque shows now, including O, Beatles Love, and Mystere, and this was by far my favorite.First of all, the tent is very intimate.  I was in the 4th row, but it seemed like there weren't more than 10 rows anyway.  You get to see the performers up close.There was a lot of audience participation.It was very funny.  It was very raunchy.  There was not only a lot of racial and sexual humor I'm an Asian female, there were definitely jokes targeted towards Asians, but I was not offended, but there was also onstage kisses between two female performers and multiracial couples.  The humor targeted whites, Russians, gays, lesbians, Asians, Jews, blacks and I'm probably forgetting some groups!  Be prepared to put aside any political correctness you have before you sit down for this show; or else you are going to be in for a very uncomfortable evening!The cast was multiracial and extremely talented.  Unlike other Cirque shows, my attention never lagged.  I paid about 90 for my 4th row ticket via the halfprice ticket booth at 4Queens on Fremont Street."

Lots of cussing, insults, and generally politically incorrect jokes throughout the show i.e. racist, sexist, elitist  probably any ""ist"" you can think of and some you couldn't. There was only one act I found particularly overthetop a soliloquy on oral sex given by Penny, but the rest of the show more than made up for this. The physical acts were amazing and entertaining; I liked it far and away better than CDS Mystere.  At times I found myself holding my breath, and at others squeezing the heck out of my husbands thigh.We had a small table in front of Penny, and it was perfect.  We didn't get singled out by the Gazillionaire but we just barely avoided this, yet still had unobstructed views.  Honestly, given the small size of the venue, I doubt there's a bad seat in the place. I think the New York Times said it well: ""Imagine Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and painted by George Grosz. A blend of skill, erotic innuendo and zaniness.

Otherwise I'd have felt ripped off. The show is good but, it's not 100 good. The venue is out front of Ceaser's Palace in a building designed to look like a tent. It's a relatively small theater in the round. Seating is in cheap metal folding chairs packed tightly together. We had table seating in the back with 5 seats crammed around an impossibly tiny table. You just have to hope you're not sitting next to a plus size person. There is also an issue with support posts that can block your view.The best part of the show is the raunchy comedy. They are very funny if raunchy, sex laced comedy is your thing. If you're easily offended by sex, dirty words, references to sexual orientation or racial jokes this isn't the show for you.They offer a variety of acts which are all very good but, if you're accustomed to Cirque shows, this is definitely second or even third tier acts. There is no direct nudity but lots of scantily dressed performers and it's easy to tell the men's religion if you catch my drift. The show has a run time of 90 minutes with a cash bar inside but no restrooms as far as I could see. Like I said, nice show, funny if you're not easily offended but not worth the 100 ticket prices listed when we picked up our tickets."

It was a great change of pace from the Cirque shows we usually attend, even if many of the acts were basically the same stuff we've seen many times before. The theater is very intimate, you are right on top of the stage and right on top of the folks sitting next to you. I loved the design choices and look of the whole space. I understand that the tight seating is a result of maximizing sales in such a small space, but it really is comical just how little room there is between rows. Airplane seating is 10x more spacious and comfortable. As far as the different sections, we sat in the lowest priced tier but ended up in the 6th row. After seeing the show, I can't see the value in the extra 50 just to be a few rows closers and have a tiny pad on the seat. If you are shorter and the only seating available is the last few rows it might be worth it.Since the seating is right against the stage you really get to see the pain/concentration in the performers faces and bodies during their performances. It's easy to lose sight of just how difficult what they're doing is since you know they perform the same thing every night, but when you see them shake and grimace you quickly realize how silly that thought is. Every act, with the exception of the bubble, held our attention from start to finish. Since most of the crowd was drunk/rowdy during our show they basically became another character in the performance. Their reactions made it seem like they were watching a sorcerer or alien on stage, much different from the more reserved response you get from the Cirque audience.Penny and The Gazillionaire offered some great laughs with their obscene humor. My wife was somehow shocked at just how far they took certain riffs, but I don't know what she expected given that is the show's MO. She wasn't offended, just surprised by the extent of the racist/sexual humor. Definitely be mindful of the people you are planning to attend with, I wouldn't spring this show on anyone without knowing for sure they won't end up offended/uncomfortable.Overall I would say this has been the best show I've attended in Vegas and would strongly recommend it to anyone who is interested in it after looking at their site and videos. If it sounds like you're kind of show, you'll love it."

Also, if you sit in the front row, you will be picked on almost for sure. But really, no one is safe.  They might pick on anyone. You will however sit on folding chairs that are hooked together so just be aware you will be close and cozy with the guy sitting next to you.

If you do find humor in these types of things, Absinthe provides a safe atmosphere to laugh at what typically would be considered inappropriate.But don't let that distract you, the talent of the performers can't go unnoticed. There is some real talent with some, not all, of these acts. No only are they very good at what they do, but they are doing it in such a confined space, that it adds some drama. This small space also gives the viewer a close and personal viewing experience from any seat in the house.  We really enjoyed the show. TIP: reserve seats at a table in the back"

Unfortunately, racist and sexist humor is not my favorite type of humor so I've deducted once circle for that.  I'm surprised no one mentioned that the seats were fold up chairs, tied together at the legs so it was WAY TOO tight and cramped, with minimal leg room. My seat was bare wood and if I slouched even a bit, I slid forward.  By the end of the evening, my tailbone was in much pain :The acrobatics were good but not spectacular. The price of this event is in the same range as Cirque du Soleil's O, and the acrobatics at O were significantly better.  I also am generally not fond of shows with reluctant audience participation, and I felt bad for the three people who got pulled up to the stage and were requested to perform lewd acts for everyone's enjoyment.So fair value for money, poor seating, good but not spectacular acrobatics, combined with sexist and racist humor caused me to deduct two circles.  If you are gay and/or not caucasian, you might want to skip this show. A minority of the jokes were funny."

Scandalous!,"After reading reviews and asking friends about this show, it was clear to me that I needed tickets. When I arrived in LV I spoke to other tourists and even locals about it and everyone who had seen it told me that I would absolutely not regret seeing it over any Cirque du Soleil show, as it's the hottest most scandalous show in town right now.The performances are absolutely incredible. I have been to Cirque du Soleil shows, and don't get me wrong  I love them and they are incredible  but this was a whole new league. I was literally sweating watching some of the acrobatic performances. When you see a 250 pound man walking a tight wire carrying a man in a chair, it's hard to keep your heart out of your throat! The performances are daring, sexy, scandalous and downright offensive at times! The host and hostess are wildly hilarious and if you sit anywhere near the front, be prepared to be insulted and made fun of!If you don't have a raunchy sense of humor, if you get offended by cwords, are offended by gay and racial humor, I wouldn't recommend this show. But if you like that type of humor, you will find yourself keeled over crying with laughter. I saw a few offended yuppie faces in the crowd who eventually were so offended they couldn't take anymore and left...but I would say 98 of the crowd would say it was one of the best shows they'd ever seen judging by laughter and facial expression.Go on bestofvegas.com to buy your tickets at a discount price! We had great seats and paid a fraction of the price about a month before the show.

I suppose the show could best be described as a Cirque de Soleil  Burlesque  Comedy Show mash up, but it was, without a doubt, one of the highlights of our Vegas Trip.Absinthe is staged just outside of Caesars Palace inside of what looks like a giant red and white tent, but do not let the modest venue fool you.   There is a bar outside of the venue where you can grab a drink prior to the performance and additionally they do serve adult beverages inside the venue as well The inside of the venue is. how shall I put this. interestingly decorated with the stage in the center and the seating surrounding the stage for 360.   Take some time AFTER the show, to really look around at some of the decorations.   They will make much more sense once you have actually seen the show.  I will stress that from what I could see, there is not a bad seat in the house and the venue is actually designed to feel quite intimate.   Even from the back of the venue, the performers are still quite close and due to the fact that a good bit of the show is actually done above the stage during acrobatic performances, I cant imagine anyone complaining that they did not have a good view of the performers.  I will also stress that the first few rows of seating are EXTEREMELY close to the stage.   This show is written to involve the audience  particularly those in the first 67 rows, so if you do not want to run the risk of being part of the show, I would suggest sitting further back in the venue.The show itself was spectacular; however, I will warn you that it will not be for everyone.   The performance has a VERY sexual theme and the comedy is i racially/ethnically charged, ii sexually charged and iii EXTREMELY GRAPHIC.  This is not to say that there is anything disgusting or disturbing, only that they really take a no holds barred approach to the comedy.  I loved it and laughed almost nonstop during the comedy portions of the act.  The master of ceremonies the Gazillionaire is hilarious and had impeccable comedic timing.  That being said, I do understand that some people are what I would term easily offended and I will warn anyone who falls into that category to steer clear of this particular show. The other half of the show consists of gymnastic and aerial performances that are similar to some Cirque de Soleil performances.   The performers are very talented, performing acrobatic acts as well as feats of strength and balance that were extremely impressive.    I will not ruin the show for anyone by describing/giving away the acts, but I will say that many of the gymnastic acts had a sexual theme to them in line with what I might expect in a burlesque show.    Nothing lewd, just erotic back and forth between the performers sometimes male/female, sometimes female/female.   Again, I enjoyed myself immensely and was particularly impressed with the strength/balance acts.In conclusion, I really cannot speak highly enough about Absinthe.  In comparison to some of the other Vegas shows out there, this was an absolute bargain and I would recommend it to just about anyone who enjoys a raucous good time!"

You will be in awe.The ONLY pitfall here, is seating. If you're even a mediumsized person, you WILL be cuddling someone else. They moved us to the 'bathtubs', which had a slightly obscured view by one of the tent's arm.On a final note: If you plan on buying tickets the day of, thinking its safe because it's an old show, you're going to be in for a surprise.

APART from this talent Absinthe is the worst show we have ever seen! It was recommended by our hotel concierge who clearly has no idea what entertainment is. Our choices were David Copperfield, Elton John or Australian Bee Gees! How he could think Absinthe would come close to any these is beyond us. We paid for VIP tickets as we were told no other seats were available. There were at least 20 empty seats on the nights. The set up is in a tent where the wooden  metal seats have seen better days. The stage is not much bigger than a child's garden trampoline. The main characters seemed to be one female  one male, who are quite frankly appallingly lacking of any talent or class. We don't mind the profanity at all, however the context in which it was used lacked any humour. Racist  personal insults seemed to be a main theme. We left before the end very disappointed to have wasted a precious evening in Vegas on this rubbish. You have been warned!!"

They're all terrifying, gravity defying, and honestly pretty freakin sexy.Every night the house cocktail is different. 10 a pop but you only need one to stumble out of there at the end. I've seen this show twice, and the first time, the drink was lemonade and vanilla vodka so gross but so strong, and last time it was OJ, orange vodka, grenadine, and amaretto. That one tasted a lot better and got me even drunker.All in all, if you can enjoy something that is absolutely trashy, you will find that Absinthe is a treasure."

My husband and I were speechless after we saw it.  We experienced the awakening of deep wounds inflicted by racist white people that never seems to heal.  When buying the tickets we were only told that there was nudity and foul language.  Those things were mild compared to the assault inflicted on every person of color who had to mask the pain as they endured the verbal attacks behind so called ""humor"".  The ""German"" and ""white guy"" humor didn't come close to the assaults done on the people of color.  The laughter from the white people in the audience was as close as you could get to a southern lynching being witnessed by insensitive Klan members in the 1950's south.  We have not come a long way.  Some white people have found new ways to articulate their racist views by calling it ""humor""."

If any of the foregoing bother you, then it would be best to stay home.Absinthe is presented in a tent in front of the Caesars' hotel and casino complex. The tent allows for seating in the round and the front row seats are only a few feet away from the performers. There are only about fifteen rows so there is not a bad seat in the house. Well, not a bad seat from the standpoint of sight lines. But ordinary folding chairs, some of which have no padding, are what your 80 or so per seat gets you for a place to sit. Fortunately, the show is so good that you will not notice when your rear end gets numb.Since I am not offended by raunchy humor and foul language, I found the entire show to be extraordinarily funny. And several of the circus acts were just spectacular, almost worth the price of admission in themselves.Absinthe definitely deserves the accolades it has received for its' entertainment value. It is definitely worth seeing."

In between, it's filled with raunchy dialogue, foul language and racisttype jokes. Extremely politically incorrect. They are all made in good fun and don't leave anyone out. During our show, there were jokes about gay men, a black couple, a white guy, Asian woman, etc. So, if you are easily offended by that sort of thing, this is definitely not the show for you. Most of the things that were said made my jaw drop in disbelief. But, I did laugh a lot, too! If you sit up close in the first few rows, you might be called out and made fun of as part of the show. You also may get wet as one or two of the performances involve water. If you don't want that to happen, sit further away. All the seats are good because it is an extremely small venue. DO NOT take children or even teenagers to this show. It's way too adult for them. You can take pictures as long as you don't use a flash. I recommend sitting at a table so you have a place to set your drink. The regular seats are very close together. I was much more comfortable at the table."

The pacing and length of the show was good overall, and the theater is great  really good size you're never too far from the action and amazingly decorated.A few minor negatives were some of the comedy was unnecessarily crude I'm not easily offended either  too much swearing and waayyyyy too much casual racism.Also, be prepared to be picked on if you're in the front couple of rows."

I think the best part of this show is that it basically takes a little from the different types of shows in Vegas and mixes them all into one.  You have the acrobatics, the comedy, and and a little of the ""adult"" shows all in one place.  As stated here, if you are easily offended and are upset by racial stereotype jokes an/or four letter curse words this isn't the show for you.The only improvement I could suggest is the chairs are terrible.  For what you are paying to see the show, the vast majority of the chairs are just uncomfortable wooden chairs and also a number of what looks like metal chairs that you'd see at a garage sale.  I understand the tent is outside and not a permanent thing probably, but the chairs got uncomfortable quick.That all being said, this is a GREAT show and I would go again in a heartbeat."

The guy at the 1/2 Price Tix stand described it as a cross between Cirque, Burlesque and Rocky Horror Picture Show. He hit the nail on the head! Located in front of Ceasar's Palace, It's a very small, quaint little venue, only 13 rows around a center stage, so you can see well from every seat. The MC and his side kick run the show with their vulgar, sometimes racist jokes and remarks in between different types of circus acts. Some of the acts are really good, talented, some not so much, but its really the MC's humor that gets people roaring in their seats.  I laughed so hard, I was crying; however, looking at my girlfriends and people around me, not everyone felt the same way. Also, it's audience participation, so if you don't want to be pulled on stage, or made fun of, don't sit in the first few rows. I would recommend this show if you are looking for something different and not easily offended.  I would not pay full price, though. If you can get 1/2 price tickets, then go."

I loved the intimate venue. It reminds me of Theatro Zinzannis in Seattle and San Francisco. The German skaters or the boy/girl aerialists were my favorite  but I was relieved to not be in the first row. I would have been terrified. The one silks performer seemed angry, perfunctory, and very ungraceful. On the other hand, I have high standards for silks, coming from Seattle. Loved the skaters, the guy on the chairs, and all the performers except the silks person.The sock puppets I will, perhaps, remember forever."

Absinthe is my favorite show in Vegas right now and the first show I recommend to all my friends visiting townbut I know they are not easily offended!  If you are the type of person who takes things personally and find crude humor to be tasteless, don't go to this show!  Go to the opera and live happily in your politically correct world!  Go see O and take a nap.  Absinthe is sexually vulgar, racially humorous though I found it to be good natured and not offensive, and also has some great acrobatic performances as well.  There's a little bit of everything in this show including audience participation.  Beware if you sit in the first few rows, you are fair game for the host to poke fun at you!  The show takes place in an air conditioned circus tent outside of Caesar's Palace.  We got table seats which were well worth it because the row seating looked cramped.  There really isn't a bad seat in the house viewwise however.  We got two glasses of champagne included with the table seats.  The only inconvenience is you have to leave the tent and walk across a courtyard to get to the nearest restroom but that's about it.  Really overlooked because of the provocative nature of this show is that the mini circus acts in the show are really as entertaining as a lot of the cirque shows in town.  The funniest skit is one in which they parody the circus performers in clumsy and raunchy fashion.  I couldn't stop laughing.  There's also a skit where a beautiful woman carries in a huge bubble and then ends up topless inside of the bubble.  What's not entertaining about that!  I personally don't understand all the haters of this show.  Why are they in Vegas  You've been warnedif you can't be self deprecating at all and/or raunchy jokes make you squirm, don't spend the money on this show.  If you enjoy off color humor, there is no better show on the planet right now except maybe for the Book of Mormon broadway show."

It is truly a variety show and does not follow a flow like other Vegas productions.  We utilized the discount coupons that were being passed out early in the day as we could not find any online discounts.  Get tickets anywhere in the theater.  There are no bad seats and as other reviews mention...the higher priced seats are in the participation zone.   We were told that we may bring in our own booze and I would recommend that for the 100 minute show.  Also, use the bathroom before entering, as it is outside of the tent.Anything is fair game in the show and you should not see this without an open mind or a sense of humor that is slightly tilted.  There's swearing, nudity or near nudity male and female, racism, sexism, politicism, and nearly a circumcision.  The talent of the performers is inspiring and when you think for a minute of how close you are to the performers you kinda shudder in disbelief.We had a blast!  The ""participants"" were very much into the act and had a great time!  The black guy, the white guy, the Asian woman, the three gay guys and the high falootin' Republican couple took everything in stride and encouraged the degradation for everyone's amusement.I've seen most of the Cirque shows and a smattering of others.  Absinthe is more bang for the buck and the most memorable of them all.Great adult fun!"

I left feeling like it would have been ok to never have seen it. My husband liked it a bit more than me. I had read reviews prior to booking tickets. I was prepared for the foul language, however, I didn't realize there would be some stripping, and so much sexual inuendo. Don't get me wrong  I was not offended by this  just not entertained. This show is definitely not appropriate for all ages and people. Lots of the jokes are very dirty in nature and are very verbally graphic. Again, not so much offended as I just didn't find it funny. It's WAY over the top. My grown children that were with us on the trip joked that we were about to witness ""soft porn""  a comment that I laughed off. Now that I've seen the show, I think they were right. Apparently they checked out some video online about the show and they knew what we were about to see. I only read reviews which mostly warned about the language lots of use of the Fword and racial slurs etc. The venue is very small and crowded  similar to a tiny circus tent. So everything you see is very up close and personal. Now, for all the negative said, there were parts I thoroughly enjoyed. Some of the strength acts will blow you away! Two people roller skating on a tiny circular platform at 75 miles an hour  amazing! There is a bit of magic, singing,dancing, trapeze, and various other acts mixed in. Just when I got to the point I was checking my watch to see how much longer before the show was over, something entertaining would take place on the stage. So, my suggestion is that you spend a little time looking at some videos online and judge for yourself. It really is a mixed bag. And far from being the greatest show on the strip! I'm glad my husband had the opportunity to see it  something he has always wanted to do. He enjoyed it more than myself or our grown children. I would not ever go back to see this show a second time, and there are shows on the strip I have seen as many as three times because they are worth repeating.  Not Absinthe!"

You can't handle this show. I've seen plenty of ""variety"" type shows, none nearly as good as this. The format is comedy mixed in between stunts, done by very attractive half naked performers. Basically everything you want in a Vegas show. On the stunts alone you will be Wowed MANY times with things you didn't think possible. You are brought right into the performers element of danger due to the size of the venue. An unassuming tent on the outside is turned into a beautifully themed show floor that sits almost 360 around the stage, and the farthest seat being maybe 30ft from the stage. The comedy is based mostly on audience interaction, playing on stereotypes. Simple idea, hilariously executed. So, don't sit in the VIP section if you don't want to be part of the show. Raunchy. Sexy. Funny. Stunning. Buy your tickets already."

The circus acts that they do at this show are great and the fact that you are in such a small intimate venue makes it even better. Add in the comedy and singing in between acts and it is just a great package. The only draw back is when the acts are not in the air it can be difficult to see depending on who is sitting in front of you. Apparently I went during 7 feet tall or higher night and had some giants in front of me. At 6'1"" I still had to bob and weave my head to get a glimpse of some of the action.

For real. The acrobatic stuff is amazing and the burlesquestyle acts and numbers are fun, wellsung/performed, and sexy but not vulgar. Props to the crew as well for all the work they do clearing sets and stuff.  Each act is unique and stunning. When some of the acrobatic acts start it's sort of like, ""oh, another one""  But each is different and pulls you in. I had chills and thought they were were very moving. Especially the asian dude and white womanvery emotionallydriven. If you think you've ""seen that"" on America's Got Talent, you haven't. These are amazingly crafted and performed acts. Loved the burlesque numbers. The Green Fairy has a beautiful voice. There is nudity but with pasties, and it is not tacky. Men are on display too, but not nude and more because of their acrobat custumes. Nowthe humor. It is raunchy, racist, and ribald. I loved it. The Gazillionaire emcee is a master at improv and skewering the audience ala Don Rickles. It was all in fun though and people were good sports. No word, sex act, or bodily function was off limits in their humor. I laughed out loud til I cried. I was in row D and you are right there. Like the first row is 2 feet from the stage. Don't sit there if you are at all scared of being skewered by the Gazillionaire. The only downsides are the crappy seats. I have never seen a cirque show so can't compare, but I think I would like this better from what I heard. I love this show and hope the performers/producers read this so they know how much I enjoyed it! I am telling anyone who comes to Vegas to see this!!!"

The seating allows for all of the performances to be seen close up. Extraordinary talent with tightrope walkers, acrobats, rollerskaters, and more. Amazing, sexy, unique, and everything needed for a memorable Vegas show. Comical, but not meant for anyone offended by sexual jokes, cussing, or vulgar humor. Some of the joking border lined ""corny"", being overthetop with the explicit sexual comments, but somehow it actually added to the humor.  The comedy act using audience members was outlandishly funny. An elderly lady was placed sitting in a chair onstage while two men from the audience did ""lapdances"" for free beer. She was a good sport and laughed  she got free drinks too. Racial and political humor also used, so don't go if this offends you. Otherwise, this is a must see show."

If you are an openminded adult who likes to laugh,  definitely go see it.    Also from a price standpoint,  it is a bargain by Vegas standards.

The first was rejected by Trip Advisor because it was too graphic in its description of the Gazillionaire and Penny's acts.  Apparently, they thought it was obscene  and that is the nub of the problem with the show.  The reviews of this show are mixed: people either love it or hate it. My wife hated it, and if she could have left early she would have done so. I thought it is a great concept but the show overplayed its hand. Here's the problem with the show. The acts are fabulous. They perform right in front of you in a very intimate setting and that is nothing short of spectacular. The acts include a strip tease, contortionists, trapeze, a beautiful make/female ""duet"" on a bungee chord which was a ""wow"" by any standard, a beautiful lady who puts herself into a giant balloon you have to see it to believe it, a tightrope act, an hilarious duo spoofing Cirque shows, and more. It is a fast 90 minutes. The problem resides in the emcee and his sidekick, Penny. It wasn't the constant use of the ""f"" word, gay humor, racist remarks, scatological remarks and the like that bothered us.  Kathy Griffin has made a career out of this and she is hilarious. The problem is that in striving to be funny, shocking and overthetop, they left the ""funny"" part backstage. Their act was crudity for the sake of crudity. You were supposed to laugh because they were being crude  and many did. My wife called it ""high school locker room humor."" And after a bit it just got dull; a onenote song. Every other word was profane and in extremely bad taste.  We felt the same way about Jon Lovitz when we saw him a few years ago; in his attempt to be funny by being crude and profane, he just wasn't. We were supposed to laugh simply because he was crude and profane. Perhaps it is a generational thing because the younger folks in the audience perhaps those closer to high school locker room age thought it was uproarious and they raved about it as we exited the tent. Me I thought that this could have been a sensational show if only the emcee and Penny and especially the emcee had been comedians instead of slash and burn offensive for its own sake. In their defense, I will say that Penny was genuinely funny on occasion. So my bottom line is that the price you will pay for seeing the amazing acts in an intimate venue is the banter of the emcee and Penny that in many respects just isn't funny. Of course, if you are offended per se by the types of humor described above, or constant use of profanity, then you should avoid this show because you will be offended."

This is Cirque meets comedy show meets cabaret.I really wasn't sure what to expect, as this show is not advertised much and there aren't many helpful reviews on the web.  But, since it was the only show we've never seen in Vegas, I bought tickets and we were off to Caesars.  1st things 1st.....I'll save you some calorieburning with this tip:  the show is held in the ""tent"" OUTSIDE of Caesars Palace.  We walked through the entire casino in Caesars before we finally asked for help and realized we actually had to go outside and enter the ""tent"".  Obviously, it's not as classy as most theaters, but don't let that turn you off. When buying tickets, there really is not a bad seat in the house.  This is coming from someone who is VERY picky about seats.  There are only a few rows of seats 11, if I remember correctly, so unless you are blind, you will be able to see the show well regardless of where you sit, or how tall you are.  The venue is rather small, compared to others on The Strip. The seats in the theater are regular, wooden, foldaway chairs.  You know, the kind you sit on at a backyard bbq.  They are not comfortable or glamorous, but once the show starts, this won't bother you one bit. Show was hilarious  both husband and I were cracking up.  However, if you get insulted by sexist, racist, political or fat jokes, DO NOT go.  We are openminded individuals from NJ/NY, and were not insulted at all.  We understood that the show was meant to entertain, not insult.  If you don't understand that, you probably shouldn't go. Acrobatics were great  comparable to Cirque shows.  There are some really talented performers in this show. Tickets for this show are MUCH cheaper than Cirque shows on The Strip.  If you are low on cash, but want to see a show, this is the one for you. Show is about 90 minutes, without intermission.  So, use the bathroom before you get seated."

Absinthe does not try to dazzle the audience with expensive stage design but rely the heart of entertaining; the performers. It is an adult show. Foul language and ""intimate"" performance are regular here. The acrobatic are right in your face as you are sitting right in front of the stage. We were fortunate to be sitting on the second row, however, there are only a total of 9 rows in total. Any seat is really a great seat. The comedy is very racial and rude but honestly, it is much better than all the other robotic routine on the strip. We went with a group of 10 and I can say for a fact that everyone found something they enjoy. The guys loved the sexy and adult humor part while the girls loved the cute muscular performance flying on stage.All in all, this is a show that has lots of heart.

Our front row seats gave us an intimate and involving experience with all the highwire acts, as well as the witty, hilarious comedy performance of the Gazillionaire.

If vulgar language, sexual overtones, racial jokes, partial nudity offend you....don't go. Plain and simple. We loved it and the acrobatic acts that went along with it!! I got to meet some very nice gentlemen from the UK at the bar area and the people that were around us were just having a fab time!! I just can not say enough good things about this show and in my numerous visits and shows this one topped them all!! Pricing for the show was very affordable and we got 4 tickets for 243....bargain!!"

I f you are not, do not go. If your unsure, do not go. However, if your okay with it, GO!!!!! Like many of my reviews say I have direct interaction with all of the shows and that has to be clear because don't want a straight laced person going. This show is incredible. The acrobatics compare to Cirque, and the humor is awesome. One of the best things of vegas shows is we can pull off jokes and all get along that wouldn't fly back home. When I went there were racist jokes, sexist, jabs at the sniors being republicans, and being a local even Ihad one of the tall souvenir cups, even I got hit for that but its all in good spirit. Its got a cabaret feel too it its just crazy and chaotic and great laughs, singing in it too, super sexy. If vulgarity is no problem, go to this show. 18  and theatre is in the round so NO BAD SEATS plus its at Ceasers so hey!"

Absinthe is very vulgar and raunchy and the circus acts are ""adultthemed""  think of it as a circusmeetsburlesquecomedy show. The actors are hysterically offensive; my boyfriend and I were literally falling out of our seats laughing. There is a ton of interaction with the audience, and the tent is very small so there is really no such thing as a bad seat unless you're scared of the trapeze artists falling on you. The tightrope walking and acrobats are just amazing. The show is for guests 18 and older. It's definitely not a family show or for those who are easily offended for those who are on the fence about this, I can not stress enough how offensive the jokes are though they are sexually explicit, racist, and very politically incorrect."

Firstly, we went in with a group of 6. 5 of us were Irish and we had one 30 year old Brazilian friend with us. We all got in without any problem but then when it came to our Brazilian friend, they told him that it was not his night and to go somewhere else. After a bit of complaining and arguing from us they shushed us and told us to get him back and hurry inside. The second incident was far more disturbing. As we were leaving, a young black man was walking out in front of us and realised that he had left his jacket inside, he went up to ask the bouncer to let him back in and a conflict began. The conflict ended with the bouncer pushing the young man down the stairs and telling him that he was in the wrong f country. We called the police to report what we had seen and were told by police men that they knew Johnny and hes a sound bloke that normally wouldnt do anything like that. We were also told that the incident wasnt that racist on the grand scale of things and as the young black man was flying back to England the next day, there was nothing we could do about it. The bouncer, Johnny, still stands on the front door every night, even after the manager was informed about both incidents and it seems like this is the normal in Copper Face Jacks. The main reason that we go there is that it stays open until after 5 but after spending a lovely night in Everleigh Gardens a few doors down until 5 am, we most definitely wont be going near Coppers again."

Very upsetting Experience!!!,We arrived at 8pm. We were 4 white women and 2 black men. One of the men being my boyfriend since 2 years. I live in Havana and have never experienced anything quite so upsetting. The barman let us in despite the fact that they weren't officially open and we ordered cocktails and a bottle of 7 year rum. We danced and had fun. At 10:30pm one of the managers approached us and said we had to pay the cover charge. Which we would have paid until he told us the men had to pay 20 and the women 10. We couldn't understand why they had to pay double. We started asking around to other couples who had entered and the men had confirmed they only paid 10 to enter. This was clearly a tactic to get us to leave. I even witnessed before my own two eyes the doorman charging 10 each for 2 women and 1 man all white at the door on our way out. It's really sad that this behaviour still exists. And it must stop. I believe the only way to stop it is to not support this kind of establishment.

I didnt quite understand what was going on, my husband came and so I requested to go back in, after lining up again. The guy just picked the rope up and showed me the way out. At this point I was so confused and a little angry now. After that, I ask him what the problem is and hes like ""I just don't feel like taking you in, Go!"" He shouts at me and I furiously and embarrassed leave. In the time I was there, the bouncer got into two fights and the same door bald guy I am talking about, shrugged a man off.

In fact it was the saving grace of the show, that and the first couple of songs such as 'Hello'.  Even the parody of Hakuna Matata was hysterical.  After those songs, I thought we were in for a real treat.  Unfortunately, we were not.I'm no prude, and swear like the best or worse of them, but the constant swearing became tedious.  Somehow, real people swearing the c and f words with such regularity falls flat.  Had the dialogue been delivered by a South Park character, such as Eric Cartman with his silly voice, it would have been funny but using racial stereotypes to deliver it was frankly distasteful.  In a cartoon, racial stereotypes are strangely acceptable, but in real life are surprisingly uncomfortable.  Was this the point of the show   If it was, it was overdone.  I have lived in an African country decimated by AIDS and AIDS is no laughing matter, nor is ""fcking babies"" in the mistaken belief that it cures this disease.  Some things are ripe for a satirical send up on stage, but not AIDS and certainly not the sexual abuse of children.   The plot was like a weak amateur production of a pantomime and just a vehicle for the satire, rather than presenting a gripping satirical story.  Good satire that is funny and clever, such as the Bin Laden scene in the Family Guy, is a joy to watch.  This was not clever.  It was predictable and tiresome, and we couldn't wait for it to finish. No wonder the doctor had ""maggots in his scrotum"".  The whole thing was rotten."

I saw it again yesterday, my ribs ache from two hours laughing. It is rude, crude, downright disgusting, and heavily blasphemous from the off. Its final message is also extremely enlightening and humanitarian, if you have enough about you to get that far. It is not for everyone. It is also the most clever and funny thing I have ever seen. The production does not spare a thing  technically, the show is nothing short of amazing. I read reviews from people saying it is a disgusting production, reliant on racism and repetition of the ""Cword"" for laughs. Not at all so. It is very challenging; it has a level of genius that not all will appreciate, and the whole thing is really a metaphor. 99 of people say it is the best thing they have ever seen. 1 get up and walk out and cannot cope.

I am honestly more shocked and confused at its reception and the success and popularity this show has garnered than the actual content itself. I felt uncomfortable at the largely white audience hysterically laughing at the antiAfrica, racist jokes. This story was written by two white men who have profited hundreds of millions of dollars off the back of issues such as genital mutilation, AIDs, and rape, in a country they generalise as 'Africa' and have probably never set foot in. I am honestly just speechless at how I am in the minority for thinking this, and how in 2018 people still think this is a smart, terrific show. The humour is childish, repetitive, cringy. I am not easily offended but this crossed a line for me.The show might as well have been a blackface performance, which at the time no one thought was inappropriate but now it's general consensus that it's racist. I can't imagine that this show will go down well in history in the future.I really think there was a missed opportunity to create a story that had clever satirical ideas without having to revert to archaic, overused, racist jokes. Racism is present and latent. It's embedded in our history and societal stucture. This musical plays on this within its audience, which is probably why people laugh. This musical takes it too far for me, personally, and I am amazed I'm in a minority. I thought by 2018 I wouldn't be."

The following thoughts may make more sense if you've seen BoM at least once. If you haven't seen it yet, I hope it genuinely entices you in to experience an event that your ordinarily sensible self struggles to believe is actually unfurling in front of you.Firstly, it is a stomach crampingly funny and foul mouthed experience, housed within one of the most uplifting and enjoyable musicals you will find in the West End, performed exquisitely by the most talented and engaging group of actors around...and now for the pseud's corner critique.Dont go if you are offended by liberal use of Anglo Saxon descriptors in all their permutations and / or use of multi layered comedic deconstruction linked to wonderful tunes  South Park meets South Pacific, as has been aptly described by others of all religions, western societal perspectives, superficiality, prejudice and corruption. Appreciate these are grand claims for a musical which on face of it can be viewed as a collection of crude, racist, misogynistic sketches to catchy tunes. However, with respect, if thats how a theatregoer processes the show, theyre missing an opportunity for some seriously meaningful reflection as to human nature and misuse of religion and abuse of power by those seeking to control the lives of their citizens, particularly women. FGM is brutally exposed for the abomination that it is; rightly and unapologetically so. Offence at the use of various names for that intimate part of a females anatomy is nothing compared to the real pain still felt by hundreds if not thousands of women still subject to this needless mutilation to this day.Highlights of the show are many so take as read the outstanding performances by Elders Price, Cunningham and McKinley.Third time around though, what struck me was the gem of the revised narration of the Mormon story to the visiting elders by the villagers using their own culture bound language with some imaginative input from Arnold. It reinforces the point that all established religions, in their origins at least, rely on oral transmission from one generation to the next Sal Tlay Ka Siti, shaped and reconfigured by contemporaneous cultural references. Why then do so many accept literally as gospel the more unpalatable elements of religion which were a product of their time and early cultureThe visually obvious double meaning of Baptise Me shouldnt be as amusing as it is to anyone older than 13 years of age but it is so wonderfully sung and choreographed by Elder Cunningham and Nabulungi, both switching effortlessly between innocence and desire, that it had me squirming uncomfortably and laughing in equal measure.As has been mentioned in countless reviews, the whole cast are incredibly talented and engaged. Id just add it feels like there is an amazing camaraderie and buzz across the whole team, making the audience I would surmise from their hearty continual appreciation  feel a real part of the event.Leanne Robinson who played Nabulingi in all three performances I have seen is a huge talent, whether in her emotional and powerful solo performances or in wholly conveying the innocence, joy and hope that I am sure Parker and Lopez intentionally built into her character.I cant end without a special mention for Steven Webb who, in my opinion, has made the part of Elder McKinley his own. You could invest a whole show watching him alone and it would be an extremely entertaining two hours. His knowing expressions and engagement, even when he is not front of stage are a lesson to any aspiring actor in being fully in character 100 of the time. I hope he stays in the role for as long as I go to see this show as his eventual replacement has big sparkly shoes to fill."

The show started off energetically but things took a rapid turn for the worse when the newly graduated Mormon elders were sent on their first Mission to Uganda. That was when the 45 minutes of essentially racist jokes started when the majority of the humour seemed to revolve around Africans having AIDS, raping babies and having ""maggots in their scrotoms"" and being totally thick. I literally cannot understand who would find this funny. I came to see this show expecting amusing Monty Python style satire and only found something that was deeply, deeply offensive. The fact that anyone actually finds this funny pretty much sums up everything that is wrong with the world. Oh, and before you think 'snowflake', I am not easily offended. I was so annoyed that the theatre is right opposite The Comedy Store, where we could have had an awesome, funny night of risque humour, but instead we got this absolute pile of rubbish that we paid 175 for. I was so disgusted I left at the interval, which I have never, ever done before.

I was really looking forward to seeing the show and had seen the fantastic reviews.  I honestly cannot fully describe how shocking it was to see people laughing and clapping at clearly racist, offensive, ignorant and childish jokes which were attempts at what is deemed to be a musical performance.  I am not easily offended, however I am dismayed that in 2018, noone has challenged this totally offensive drivel that totally disrespects Africans and thinks that making jokes for example about raping babies and FGM is entertainment.  My daughter and I watched the predominantly white audience around us laughing and clapping wondering how intelligent people could find this production enjoyable.  I constantly cringed throughout the first half of the performance.  When the second half was about to begin my daughter and I left.  The woman sitting next to me said it's only ""lighthearted"".  I disagreed and as black women find it disappointing that as another black woman she couldn't understand how disrespectful this whole production was.  All Africans live in mud huts...rape to prevent AIDS....etc.  I am left wondering that if this production was about another race or religion would it have been so popular.....Please DON'T waste your money or time watching this absolute rubbish."

These people, who on the most part claim to be veterans of the theatre world using phrases like 'I have seen every West End show' and 'I spend a lot of time at the theatre', seem to be calling out the 'majority of the audience' as being somehow immature, racist and insensitive towards religion by finding the show remotely funny. They also attempt to back up their flawed argument by saying that in their 'expert' opinion, the show has no depth and is only toilet humour.I am by no means a theatre veteran, however I'm sure that I'm not the only one who can see that behind the jokes the underlying theme of the story is that regardless how the outside community perceive the Book of Mormon or religions in general, what counts is that it provides hope and purpose to those who need it and choose to be involved in it.

Whilst I'm not a huge fan of musicals, there'd been so much hype around this production, so I thought I ought to give it a chance, plus the premise of the show sounded quite funny from the outset. However, watching Book of Mormon in reality was a totally surreal experience  I couldn't believe the 'humour'  racism, jokes about female genital mutilation, talk of babies being raped, plus an insulting depiction of Africans and religion. And even though I'm not a prude kind of person, I was sat there feeling puzzled throughout the twohour long show. What was even more bizarre was looking around the theatre at the rest of the audience who were exploding into hysterics   was I missing something! According to the rest of the audience, a black person putting on a Ugandan accent and saying the fword is hilarious...There was the odd moment where something mildly amusing happened, but nothing to me was laughoutloud funny. I bet if this same production was applied to the Islamic faith, there'd be uproar about it! Positives about Book of Mormon were that the actors were really good  super enthusiastic and full of energy, which was enjoyable to watch. However, at the steep price of 42 quid a ticket, I wouldn't recommend seeing Book of Mormon. After seeing the show for myself, I think it just highlights the power of marketing and PR, as I believe this largely accounts for the production's success. "

To my mind price should reflect both production cost and quality, both of which were lacking from this show. The only reason we bothered was because we had some Ticketmaster vouchers that were due to expire and had to be used on something, otherwise I would NEVER pay full price for this crap. There are essentially just two sets. And although well done, these, the costumes, the lighting and so forth were very straightforward. When you think about the complexity of shows such as Wicked, Ghost, Lord of the Rings, Bodyguard, Phantom, this was one step up from a high school play so it's disgusting that they charge so much. And as for the content, I pray to God a la Mormon that the success of this show does not mean the state of things to come in the West End because if that's the case, theatre is doomed. I am anything but politically correct and my humour is very much about pushing boundaries. But child rape, female genital mutilation and the most brazen racism I've ever encountered just takes it too far. I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh  there are some very funny moments, but this not only crossed the line; it left the line many miles behind.Crude lyrics aside, the music is catchy and some of the voices were excellent, as was some of the choreography. But that's not enough to to detract from the exceptionally poor taste that underpins this entire show and the extortionate price they charge."

The satire was biting. Its exposure of western attitudes toward Africa, its way of making you reexamine your own atitudes towards cultural differences and the terrific way it forces you to see that issues such as FGM and baby rape are really happening are just some of the examples.  I particularly admired the way they contrasted Africa's vs first world problems ""80 of us have AIDS"" vs ""my bus was late"", was one notable example. Of course FGM is not funny but including it in a comedy show means that many more of us become aware of it and may even be inspired to do something about it.Compared with other South Park programmes it's actually pretty kind to the Mormons, since the central message seems to be that although much of their bible is a nonsense if it nevertheless leads people to be nice to each other, that's a good thing. I noticed that the Mormons themselves have a one page advert in the programme.The music is not  bad, although not brilliant either. Who cares, when we laughed all the way through Trey and Parker must be some of the best political observers and analysts of our generation. And they make us laugh at ourselves too.

I see fellow naysayers were offended by the subjects of the humor, but if you've ever enjoyed Trey and Matt's work, you know what you're in for. You also recognize that they don't mock subjects directly ie: Africa, rather, they expose the prejudice that exists in society; in this case, the institutionalized racism of Mormon doctrine.To me, the show commits a far greater sin than approaching topics like race, homosexuality and female circumcision: it is not funny. I managed a few smiles and the rest of the time wondered why most everyone else was rolling in the aisles.Also disappointing was the fact that the songs are not engaging or memorable. This was a real surprise considering how good Trey's music has been elsewhere see the Academy Award nomination for 'Blame Canada'.The two lead missionaries have great energy and are obviously talented, but the material they're working with is, as Cartman would put it, ""........lame."""

Yes, there are some absurd props/actions. Yes, some topics will offend certain narrow minded people. However, IMHO, the creators use these guises to subversively mock the audience and not the subject matter. The clear irony of it all is that people that don't like it are the ones that think it's 120mins of 'fart jokes'. It is not the prudish or the politically correct who dislike this show, it is the people who are not intelligent enough to see past all of the tomfoolery and hear the real message.

It walks a fine line just this side of racism in its depiction of Africa, but you also wind up loving and respecting their constant struggles to escape their horrible conditions. It is just cynical about the beliefs of organized religion and the romanticized depiction of Africa in the Lion King. Don't go if you are easily offended.

It came across as try to hard and on many occasions just downright crass and highly offensive/racist. It was cringey to watch. Our experience certainly wasn't helped by the fact we didn't have great seats way over to the side next to the wall in the stalls  bought from someone at work who could't go at the last min not a single actor ever looked to the sides of the audience everything was directed to the centre of the audience so it was difficult to engage which obviously didn't help.Overall yes the concept was there and had the potential to be funny but we just felt it came across as cheap shots which didn't hit the mark for us.Plenty of other people have enjoyed it and each to their own but I felt compelled to leave this review as we were so disappointed as we left the theatre and lets face it theatre tickets aren't cheap!"

While some reviews state that it is racist, puerile, and making a joke out of things like female genital mutilation and rape, I would say that it is simply bringing these issues to light, which are still happening in many African countries.  They are not mocking these practices and making jokes out of them, but just giving an insight into life in a small Ugandan village, and how ridiculous it is that a bunch of Mormons want to convert them to the church when they have bigger problems to deal with there.Allinall, it is incredibly funny and original, with catchy songs I went straight home and bought the soundtrack and an incredible cast  a completely unmissable show!

I looked at several including Adagio, but this one is miles ahead of them all.All the negative reviews on tripadvisor are from people who could not get into the club. It's a business, you dress well, have both female/group, spend money and cause no trouble you will get in. We are British Indians, there was no racism by the door staff, yes we had to pay 700 euros 50 euros each to reserve a table, VIP entry and then we could spend 700 on bottles of drink. It's one of the best clubs I've been to in a long time, you walk in and the first part is like a wine bar where you chill, the centre of the bar has a huge lit up tree in the middle, around midnight, one by one all the VIP guests are taken to the club, through a small door, security is very tight. Once seated they take your drinks order. It takes about an hour to get all the VIP tables sorted, 1am the Rnb music starts, and the remaining guests are filtered through from the wine bar area. The females in our group felt very safe, it's the first club I've been to where the female to male ratio is a lot higher. 65 female/35  male...I think that says it all. No sleazy blokes, I got talking to a gentleman in the VIP area who had a table for one, with a bottle of grey goose.He is a nightclub owner but comes here to unwind once a month, and advised that this was the no.1 club in Berlin, as they are very strict in who they let in. So don't listen to the negative views, if you going to try and get in, dress smartly, try and come as a mixed group...stag groups haven't got a chance unless you book VIP."

Many of our friends had recommended Berghain to us so we thought we'd give it a go. We visited on a Sunday as it would be quieter. We queued up and all of the people in front of us who just so happened to be white got let in. When it came to my girlfriend, the doorman said ""no,you're not coming in. I don't like the look of you"". My girlfriend replied ""why"" when another doorman grabbed her from behind and threw her on the floor. As she got up, he punched her so hard in the face that I heard it. As she got up, shaken and in pain, all 4 of the bouncers started laughing. We shouted at the bouncers that we were calling the police. We stood about 20m away from the entrance, when 2 female staff members came out of the club and threatened us and told us to leave. When we explained what happened and that we were calling the police, the women started hitting us and then grabbed us and dragged us to some benches about 50m away, whilst the doorman who punched my girlfriend followed behind them. Eventually when the police came they spoke to the doorman but it was clear that they didnt care.As we were leaving, a local couple came up to us and said that Berghain is notorious for being racist and violent to black people. PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE A POC, IT IS NOT SAFE. After what we were hoping would be a fun night, my partner and I are traumatised. Her jaw is swollen and sore when she chews or talks. My wrists are sore from where the female staff members grabbed them up. Please boycott Berghain. They employ aggressive and dangerous people and exercise and uphold racism.The photograph attached is of my girlfriend's hoop earring that was crushed by the impact of the doormans punch."

A friend and I queued up on a Sunday afternoon. We had fully expected to be turned away  its just what happens and for a lot of people it must be very confusing why. I dont think there is a particular dress code, it doesnt matter whether youve had a couple of drinks and certainly has nothing to do with racism we are Australian and dont speak much German. But, if and when you get inside it is the most incredible sensory overload, surrounded by people who are there to have a good time with no judgement. The dark, industrial interior compliments the music and creates an awesome atmosphere. If you love techno and are open minded, you have to try Berghain, and if you get knocked back, be respectful, and you can always try again. I left there with my friend and there were literally no words to describe the breathtaking experience we had. This is the best club in the world."

All the reviews stating the door policy is racist are complete nonsense, inside the crowd is vastly mixed. White, Black, Asian, Latin, Young, Old, Gay  Straight. It's this stringent and undefinable door policy that has created something truly special inside arguably the safest clubbing space any of us had ever entered. There are no judgements here; people whoever they may be can become who they want and do what they want whilst within the club. We have never experienced this before at a club and it truly was something to behold. A place where one can act out ones fantasies without fear of shame of reprisal in the after event. Berlin is a truly special city and Berghain is more than just a club with a confusing and sometimes alienating door policy. It's a welcoming, open  truly inspirational place to party. Treat the place with the respect it deserves and you will be greatly rewarded once you step through its doors. Clubbing will never be the same again the benchmark has been upped to unrealistic/superhuman levels by this wonderful wonderful venue. Thank you Berlin  Thank you Berghain!"

So, Sat Oct 1 the big day arrived and I realized this is something totally out of my hands  and decided to go with absolutely zero expectations and to enjoy the ride. I wore black pants, grey tank with flower pattern, black fall jacket and black shoes. Btw I am a 35 year old brown single male, look younger about 26/27. My motto was ""if I dont get in...life goes on"". Arrived around 12:30, line was huge but being in the queue for two hours was an experience itself, met so many great people and all of us had the same mindset. Once we got closer the selection process was very much visible and thats when everyone got serious and quiet. Then Sven appeared, for some reason I felt like he was staring right at me maybe because I have a manbun like him  lol. Most people before me got in, wont lie in my head it was more like ""this is it! watergate here i come lol "" but decided to act calm and confident. So my turn comes, bouncer standing to my left smiles at me and I said in a very calm way ""hi, how u doin"" with a smile and look away. Sven stares at me for few seconds and he gives the nod within split seconds the other bouncer waves me in, honestly I couldnt believe it! Then this rush out of no where hits my head.. it was a blur. They didnt even search  me and points to the cashier..pay 16 Euros, get the stamp and enter this so called paradise.I wont mention what I saw or experienced  just to respect the club and its people. But yes it is huge inside, Surprisingly, the music was not that great.. am more into tech house. Berghain was playing hardcore techno and Panoramo had more my style. Took time exploring the whole place not once but several times and yes it is quiet fascinating, we have something similar on a smaller scale in Toronto called Comfort zone but everyone gets in, no dark rooms and its more ""tamed"". Some people told me music is better on sunday evening.So after spending 14 hours, got my hand restamped and leave around 3 pm on Sunday, queue outside was enormous. Later that night they didnt let me in even with a stamp saying it was not completely visible but I think its because of my jeans or simply didnt fit the criteria for that night so I hit Watergate. Berghain is not racist, saw people from all walks of life. Bartenders, bouncers and other workers were all polite to me. This place is an institution, a mecca for many people and respecting their ""culture"" is what Berghain looks for when screening.Other than the music my overall experience was pretty good and am grateful for being allowed in. I think its the hype that makes this place so much more attractive. But people seriously remember its just a ""club"". My advice, have a plan B, dont expect to get in, act calm and confident, dont have that hungry look on your face."

I thought my clubbing days were coming to end but this place took me back the 90s warehouse raves but a hundred times better and I was by no means the oldest in there. Arriving at Ostbahnhof with thousands of other hopefuls we walked the short distance to the old power station and joined the line. It was a long wait 2.5 hours, but well worth the wait, during the time we kept our voices down, didn't get drunk and ignored the hawkers which approached us  a simple ""nein"" and they eventually got the message. As we got closer to the door we saw Sven or as he is fondly call The Lord of the Night. Sven is the daddy and with his security team they decide who is coming in. There is no VIP or guest list, ""celebrities"" have been turned away but their format for selecting who comes in or who does the walk of rejection is the reason why this place is heaven on earth and has the reputation as the best club in the world. When we got to the front we waited and the doorman said in German two and in my best German I said no four, he looked and said English and I said ja he nodded and we walked in! I can't explain the euphoria I felt walking in, after seeing literally hundreds of people get turned away we were in! We remained cool and passed security, there are full checks and phones have their camera lens covered. Photography is strictly forbidden. After security, we paid our 16 euros and we walked into the foyer, this massive space with large clock room. What amazed me was the size it is literally like walking into a cathedral with its high ceiling.We headed straight for the bar service was fast, we waited less than 5 minutes to get served, another great thing about Berghain is the fast friendly service. The crowd aren't drinking fancy cocktails or Cristal champagne it's ice cool bottle of beer and water, all very reasonably priced. It doesn't exploit its customers, more reasons to love this place. The main room was pumping we were fortunate to get the last 30 minutes of Ben Klock, just one of the many world class DJs that play here. Getting lost in the dry ice, the smiles from the crowd, the sweat pouring off me  and the freedom to be whoever you want to be and just party! The lights, strobe and lasers are something else and the sound system is out of this world. Up more stairs and you come to Panorama bar, playing funky house, the music isn't too loud that you can chat and make new friends. Panorama is very much a house party feel it's just so cool. This club is raw, underground, industrial full of free spirits who are up for partying it's very mixed of ages and nationalities. We stayed 6 hours and met some wonderful people, danced like I haven't danced in years and for me that sense of freedom and liberty in a world full of hate this club is the opposite it's just full of love. Fat, thin, beautiful, less attractive, black, white, yellow, gay, straight, bi, trans, abled bodied, disabled, young and old, everyone gets on and is enjoying the party! If you are homophobic, racist or have any other hang ups this isn't a club for you and I wouldn't waste your time trying to get in but if your non judgemental and like to party hard you will appreciate The beauty of Berghain. Thank you for the most incredible night of my life. "

We left wondering whether it was because we were 2 straight couples or beacause we were dressed too normal, or just because the doormen were pure racist. I guess a bit of all, but made me to read the door policy at the other clubs we went to very carefully. This one says: do not dress too nice, do not smile and cheer while in the queue, don't come in groups....so basically Berlin's 'best club' wants me to drop my friends, get some clothes from a homeless guy on the corner, look to the ground and mumble for myself otherwise I would not fit!

Wow club was amazing, music was evenmore amazing an there was a very big group of mixed people inside. Very diverse club with lots of multi cultural people within. Do not listen to reviews stating that they are racist just because they didn't get in! Once being to the club I realise why they turn people away an would of not been upset if I had been turned away. I honestly think they pick each person to preserve the vibe an diversity of the club. Tips come in twos, don't speak in queue, wear black an wait to be spoken to once reach the front. Also learning basic German words might help! Overall best club/music experience I've encountered, clubbers, bar staff an bouncers where super friendly. 10/10 experience! "

It is a shame that Berghain's management believe that they are successful by allowing their Bouncer to illtreat visitors at the entrance. As avid travelers around the world, it was shocking to experience the brutal behavior of refusing visitors into the Club. The Bouncer has been given the power to speak and behave offensively to visitors who he chooses to refuse entry. There are no particular rules for the Club and the decision made by the Bouncer is clearly based on his judgement. We were observing the Bouncer and it was very clear that he was insulting and shunting out people who were mainly tourist and couldn't speak German. Even if the Club has certain conditions to refuse entry, I'm sure they can conduct this process in a decent and polite manner. I'm even surprised the Human Rights Authority in Berlin have allowed Berghain to continue their business under such inhuman conditions.  There should be a better reason why a night club should be popular. There are no moral principles or intelligence to such discrimination by Berghain. We were literally asked to 'Get Out' because I guess we were Indians and because we didn't speak 'German'. Do not recommend this Club to any one unless you want be maltreated!

Having lived in London my whole life I've never felt more racially segregated... to be genuinely disregarded for the bar, before even assessing my state at the time by the head bouncer was not only humiliating but depressive. I would hope a company that operates on such a broad scale would take the time to find some staff that aren't so bigoted and cruel. It is disgusting and I hope this place changes... it is 2017 and I'd hoped racism had been left behind, sadly not."

","While me and my friend attended the establishment, we waited at the bar for around 15 minutes and ordered some drinks. We then walked to the other side of the bar and were told forcefully to step outside. Apparently we had a potent smell of marijuana on us. I was wearing Givenchy  gentlemen only and my friend was wearing Dior Homme, for the record. We were then told to empty our pockets, which we did, although it was a massive inconvenience. They then patted us down and found nothing, as there was nothing to find. My friend and I explained that we wouldn't take such risks as smoking marijuana because of our jobs, and we proceeded to explain that if we had been smoking marijuana, we would be acting accordingly. One bouncer, the extremely skinny one who should consider a new profession claimed that when he ""smokes a blunt"" he's fine  so perhaps that's where the smell was coming from They said they would talk to other people in the area, of course they didn't though. The only two people of an ethnic backgrounds are obviously in possession of marijuana  stereotypes in 2015, who would've thought it. The larger bouncer, an overweight guy by the name of Danny, then decided to label us as threatening and aggressive, after we said we would wait for the police, and after we questioned his fabricated authority. We were then told to leave, weren't able to finish our drinks  and the management weren't much help either. After hearing several other reviews regarding the doormen of this under par facility, it's probably worth avoiding altogether. "

Completely irrational and obtuse. He has zero social skills and is self righteous. He refused to let us in as genuine new movers into the area because we were ""not locals"". Describing our genuine situation as being new to the area, he refused our claim and said that to prove that we were locals we would have to visit on a Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday before expecting entry on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday. He then proceeded to let in numerous other groups after us.  As two gentlemen arriving at 11.30pm on a Thursday, we were extremely confused by the situation and baffled by the doorman's illogical and irrational behaviour. Completely wrecked our evening.

Myself and a friend were at the front, and were turned away as the night was 'for regulars'. However my friends behind me in the queue were let in with no issue. I had a funny feeling we were turned away due to the colour of our skin, which is absolutely shocking. How someone can decide who to let in to a bar due to their race is appalling. This bouncer needs to be fired as below, the big white guy. Waste of time and energy as we just ended up having an argument with him, only to be rudely shunned away as if we were some pieces of filth. Horrendous behaviour and attitude."

Whether it be Putin and Abu Bakr alBaghdadi one week, or your seething other half the next, it would seem as though we are always under threat we are never safe and we have nowhere to call home! That is of course, until I found The Slug! The Slug is like that moment you collapse onto the sofa after a long day, that moment you wake up late in a panic before realising its a Saturday, that moment you think youve left your passport behind and then realise you were holding it the whole time. The Slug is relief. The Slug is relaxation. The Slug is release. There is no judgement. We are all equals in the eyes of The Slug. Ive seen a man throw up all over himself whilst wearing a Superman shirt. We all realised the irony and he may have briefly appeared on Instagram, but we did not judge. We applauded this man, for this man felt safe, he needed a release, and he knew The Slug would offer him that drunken solace. There is also charity in The Slug. We are offered drinks so cheap that it makes The Salvation Army look like a bunch of money grabbing fat cats!! Where else in London can you buy 15 jager bombs for 30! Only The Church offers cheaper wine but the vicar drinks most of it, and the playlist at church has nothing on the back to back 50 Cent In Da Club and Beyonce All The Single Ladies. However what is shared between these great pillars of civilisation is a sense of community and a feverishly warm welcome. The bouncers at The Slug, in the famous words of Admiral General Aladeen The Supreme Leader of the Republic of Wadiya in the critically acclaimed documentary titled The Dictator are like mafroom Wadiyan fruit, hard and spiky on the outside, but soft and really mushy on the in. Whilst they may seem a little unfriendly, once a level of trust is reached, there is no warmer welcome in South West London. Unfortunately Shane described, a tad racially I may add, as the white English man by one ignorant antislug is no longer on the door, but he was the first to introduce us to the new boss with a broad smile and a friendly pat on the back. So, if youre looking for a warm welcome, a feeling of instant release, an experience of real community, and an opportunity to get completely annahilated off the shrapnel in your back pocket, then head down to The Slug and enjoy a night youll never forget!!"

I asked him if he was going to let other people in and he said, yes.So its only us that youre not letting inYes.WhyIm not saying.One of my friends asked if its because were American and English, and he replied, No loud Americans and no loud English. What I literally had not spoken a word the entire time waiting in the queue up until he was denying us entry, since I had been people watching. He could see that Im Asian and my friends look Arabic. In fact, everybody in front of and behind us were all white, and they were all let in.After reading reviews online about Workmans, Ive come to realize that this is standard practice here. Even if they as an establishment do not discriminate, their doormen represent them and if after so many negative reviews, this problem still exists Then they are condoning this bigotry and racist behavior with their inaction.AVOID this place at all cost!"

Was having a fabulous time until we attempted to try out the Workman Club.  We all arrived in groups of 3 or 4. The first group who were rather tipsy but all white, walked into the club without incident. The second group, with 3 white and one black were told they could not go into the club because one or two of them were drunk. Now, as they were all sober were rather shocked at this news. When the doorman were asked for the real reason they the white members of the group were told 'it's not you... Hint hint'. The remaining girls all turned up in taxis to find that we also were not allowed to enter the club because this time 'our group was too big'. But had we entered the club as we arrived in groups of 3/4 they wouldn't have realised we were all together. Let's call a spade a spade. They just didn't want black people in the club. Shocking example of racism in Dublin. Rated 0 stars.Luckily we managed to have an excellent night in Mezz bar. Live music, good beer and good vibes. Rated 4 stars out of 5."

APPAULED,"Never in my life have I experienced such treatment in any venue. Me and my friends booked a table for my friends birthday for 250.00. As we arrived the service was very poor but to make it worse, towards the end of the night, say about 2a.m. the club resold our table to another set of people. We went back to our table to find another set of people sitting there and drinking our bottle of Moet and using our chaser. I proceeded to ask a girl sitting at the table to kindly move over so I can sit also and that she was welcome to join. She proceeded to threaten me in my face, stood up, put her fist in my face and said 'im going to knock you out three times. She said id need to get securty to sort the situation out. I went to the security guard who confirmed that it was indeed the table we were on. He then proceeded to get the manager Henry to deal with the situation. Henry proceeded to speak to the girl and then moved us to another table bear in mind our alcohol was still on the other table No apologies, no compensation, no efforts from the staff whatsoever. The VIP manager a lady named Katherine I spoke to who had clearly sold off our table then informed me that we will have another table in the corner in a very rude manner. I proceeded to exit the stairs to find one of my friends and was approached by the same girl who previously threatened me, shouting at me again saying she was going to kill me and knock my teeth out. Henry the manager, then turned to me as if Id insinuated the incident. I was absolutely shocked. I had no hang ups with this girl, didnt know her and did not know why she was speaking to me like that. A guy who was with her then proceeded to come over to me to tell me to ignore her, im sorry but i take assaults very seriously, especially when I am not in the wrong. Henry the manager then proceeded to blame me and my friends for the incident, saying that he 'cant be explicit' to deal with the situation and why dont we 'just get out' proceeding to then blame me and say that the girls actions were 'nothing' and why cant we just 'keep to ourselves' As I proceeded outside to find my friend Henry then says to me 'oh your other friend who is white is civil and nice and you are the complete opposite' Now im sorry, I am trying to help my friends in the best way possible, save our money and our night, and defend myself towards one of your customers throwing threats in my face and youd like me to not inquire with you about any of this He was beyond rude and racist towards me, making racist comments towards my friends and basically waiting for all of us to leave although our remaining party had done absolutely nothing to cause any trouble whatsoever. I know clubbing in London I would have never experienced this issue, as it would have been dealt with by police. I am planning to take this matter further with shoosh, Katherine the manager and Henry who supposedly dealt with the situation on the night making it worse for all of us. If I am unsuccessful I will be writing to press about the club's antics. I am extremely disappointed in security lying about CCTV footage, the management for being so rude and racist and overall in the venue for not getting what we paid for. My poor friends who had travelled miles for the night were left feeling racially attacked and like they wasted their money. Would not recomment this place for any reason. The floor is sticky and VIP area also sticky and gross, the alcohol cheap and poisonous, the bottles are clearly refilled and the only helpful people were the floor staff who informed me that the management is constantly racist and this happens often apparently and that I need to take this up with the owner, Igbal"

He only allowed women that let him touch them or were pretty. I never thought i could find a place were discrimination and pervert employees were allowed."

The Bouncers completely ruined our night. They allowed several teens who openly admitted they were under 18 into the venue, and they were simply told that they were not allowed to drink. However, when my two friends  who are 18  attempted to gain access they were met with a very rude and dismissive rejection. This may have been for several reasons, however when the only two sober 18 year olds not allowed in are of a differing ethnic background to the bouncers, the topic of racism is called into question. After refusing to see any form of ID from one of the boys, the bouncers forced the rest of us back in to the venue and continued to allow other 17 year olds in to the pub. After 40 minutes my two friends decided to leave and we were all left agitated and disgusted with unfair treatment of the two. This was only built upon when the party was shut down early when the bouncers claimed that one of the boys tried to swing for him. This turned out to be untrue as the boy was not intoxicated or violent. The actual circumstances were that he had been punched in the back of the head as he was walking away by one of the bouncers. Many onlookers corroborate this version of events. NEVER have I experienced such unruly, aggressive and vulgar behaviour from bouncers. It was clear they did not want us there and found reasons to get us out. I must say, the bar tenders apologised several times and made it very clear it was not them who had complained and complemented us on our civilised gathering. If I had any advice for people wanting to have any form of party here I would suggest you DONT unless you want you want half your group waiting outside, the odd person punched and the group racially segregated."

Last night we tried to go in this bar but the bouncers would not let us enter without ENGLISH ID whatever English ID is. We are near enough 30 years old and apparently a foreign driving licence or national ID card is sufficient to travel between countries, but not to prove age. After asking for the bouncers names they refused and told us we were giving them a headache. In my opinion they were just being racist and this is yet another example of bouncers on a power trip."

We all wanted a good time and a nice night and intended to spend a good amount of money  it wasn't as if we planned to go in there and sit like donuts. Our plan was to go into the Shisha area and then move into the bar/club part. However, the bouncer at the Shisha area refused us entry saying a. There was no space and b. He doesn't speak English. We could clearly see space and there were people coming in and out. Next we thought Ok maybe he is right so we headed to the club entrance. I immediately approached the bouncer in a friendly manner and greeted him. I then asked about entry and coincidently and rather abruptly he said ""no space"". I was then shocked to see he had let some white Europeans in immediately almost 10 seconds after us. I the asked again is there no space at all. He goes ""no, no space"". We were dressed in shoes and blazers for which we would usually get into fancy Mayfair clubs in London. There was not a single ounce of doubt in my head that this was definitely because we were Asian. I am warning you. If you are ASIAN or BLACK Do not go to this club. The bouncers define racism. FYI I am not pulling out the race card. I would just like to say we then left for club 555 who were very polite at the door and let us in. We were then treated well and I'd definitely recommend all tourists to go to club 555 instead!"

I was super confused and asked why she thought I was Muslim, what a Muslim person looked like, and why it mattered.  After some ridiculous negotiation, I had to go back to my hotel and get my passport to prove I was American not sure what that has to do with not being Muslim and finally got it.  The club closed 45 mins later without notice and the drinks were ridiculously expensive. There was a mix of creepy old ""rich"" men, prostitutes, and teenagers.  Would NEVER go to this club again!"

We weren't asked for any booking ,they didn't check for our ID and we didn't have to wait in queue as well. We went in, got a table and started ordering drink and siders. Ambience was good, music was brilliant and service was great as well... So the experience was going to be amazing until this happened. A friend came in a little late and I went out to get him. The bouncer at the entrance denied him entry at the pretence of dress code  as he was wearing sneakers and then he asked us to step aside. And just 2 mins later 2 other men in sneakers went in. Then a group of people with torn jeans and sneakers went in and we were astonished as to why aren't they denied entry. Upon confrontation this guy says they have a reservation and so if you can pay 650 he can make an exception. Now it was clear he was taking us for a ride. I asked to speak to his manager to which he replied wait here for 10 mins and he would be here, of course no one came, later on his colleague comes in saying I am the manager and justifies saying it's his bouncer's rule and his discretion here so he can deny entry to anyone. At this point we were furious because we were being descriminated against. Here are a few photos can't upload a video here the whole episode where you can see him allowing others in sneakers and denying us on the same ground. It has left us wondering if it was racism or something else. Eitherways it spoilt our mood and makes me wonder if anyone else has experienced something similar. May be time to voice out."

You would get turned away if your dress code is below par, but I will strongly disagree with a previous reviewer suggesting some racial discrimination at the front door, the clientele is totally multicultural, so I suggest look for reasons other than that if you get turned away.

I have backing of 8 other students I happen to know personally from different nationalities.An Indian friend said she's been to the gates of Spice Market 6 times in the last 2 years and turned down 5 of the 6 times for various unwarranted reasons that eluded logic. The only one time she got in was because it was New Years and she had PAiD for entry.Another friend confessed never being able to step in because the security doesn't seem to like groups of coloured people. You can be dressed formally head to toe, have a valid ID and every intent to have a good night, but if you've got a coloured skin it becomes imperative to have a plan B if Spice market is your plan A.Having lived in Melbourne for so many years now, I take pride in that fact that we welcome people from all countries and races but Spice Market never fails to tame that belief.

When he arrived she asked one of us to point him out and when he did, her immediate reply was 'No.'  our friend is black, so judge for yourself. He is always dressed perfectly, so cannot have been about his outfit. They later claimed it was because there were too many men in the club, but that can't be the case as they were still okay about him joining us until he was pointed out.When one of us complained about the door policy being racist, the staff at the door called that person an idiot.

Not their fault they were born boys..As if that was bad enough, there were a group of people behind us who had a list who were also rejected. We met them soon after. I asked them why they were rejected and a nicely dressed Asian girl replied 'they told me I'm not allowed in because I'm different and don't fit in with their image'. We were all absolutely shocked at how utterly ignorant these people on the door are. Who on earth do these people think they are and why do they believe that their job is so prestigious that they are allowed to be sexist and racist to people they should be treating with respect This is the worst club ever, the people on the door are nasty racist people and they will knock your self confidence to make themselves feel powerful.

The door woman is a stuck up, foul woman who shows no compassion. Myself and my two friends waited in the queue for roughly an hour only to be rejected by this disgraceful individual. Despite being on a promoter's guest list and only 15 people max having got in, she claimed that there was a ""limited"" guestlist and therefore only two of us can enter. The underlying implication was that one of us was not good enough for Cirque. I understand that Cirque has an image to preserve and want to attract the right clientele but none of us are ugly so it was simply a ridiculous judgment. There were 4 girls in the queue behind us who got let in, no questions asked. One of which I knew and who, as a favour, asked the doorwoman to let myself and my friends in. Her response was that we were not ""Cirque enough"" which sounds absurd considering we were all well dressed. She then specified exactly which one of us could come in  coincidentally my white friend and not either me or my friend who is mixed raced. This was downright racist and absolutely appalling behaviour on the part of a club which is in the most diverse city in the world. The door woman looked at us as if were scum which I found even more degrading considering she could have at the very least shown some respect or been polite. She then proceeded to tell us to stop standing near the queue although I was trying to speak to the promoter to understand what was going on. None of us were drunk and nor do we look like rowdy girls who don't belong in this scene considering we all went to private schools. I am certain it was solely based on race as when I asked my friend who was let in what it was like inside she noticed that everyone was European and that there was no one of colour. It's an absolute shambles. I do not recommend going here unless you want to greet someone at the door who discriminates based upon race, in other words Hitler. "

As one of the previous reviewers have mentioned the door men were VERY QUICK to get us out of the queue indicating, he will get us in EARLY. WHY would they, it was a long queue....we were suspicious but followed the man to the door that is when we realized all they did was singling us out to publicly humiliate a friend before refusing entry. Their comments were ""Your ID doesn't look like you at all, the Photo ID is really pretty"" ""Is this your daughter's ID""!! It was appalling and totally unacceptable behavior, but then when you have racist rude men at the door there was nothing else we could do! We did have IDs, They crosschecked another form of ID to confirm name but still didn't let us in not sure why they even asked us ot produce further IDs, which confirmed the identity and the name of my friend. It truly was appalling behavior. My advice is if you are not white, blonde, bra less and in a skimpy outfit looking like a wanna be celebrity then avoid this place."

My other 2 friends were also fine but started telling my friend that they really cant believe its her at which point she said its been issued 8 years ago but you can see its me. Then he went up to saying 'you have been very pretty' to which I said 'have been' then he said no she still is now. Then called 'the boss' for him to say the same and then ask for a bank card which she had. Looked at both and said he isnt still happy with it and it looks like it could be her daughters DL. we just wanted to get out of that place asap as thats a bad thing to say plus if shes old enough to have a daughter who has DL shes surely old enough to get in to club. Absolutely pathetic experience... If any of the management to see this review please explain.... 1 3 asian girls with a white girl and they didnt bother to see our photo matched our face but signles out the white one... totally could be racist but thought if the white girl is the issue it wouldnt look like that. 2 if a DL is issued for 10 years during the that term if it was good enough to get a mortgage to prove that its her how come it wasnt good enough 3 if he was anyway not happy with the photo why dragged the drama by asking for a bank card which she clearly had obviously under the same name as DL and then to turn down again asking for a passport.

He then walked back to the girl at the desk and whispered something to her. At this point, we were about to walk through however the girl then suddenly stopped us and reluctantly asked us to pay 20 each. We were shocked as we were on a guest list so didn't have to pay. As we had planned to celebrate my friends birthday here, we ended up paying 60 between us however we stood by the desk for about 5 minutes to see if the other girls had to pay and none did. Not even the guys paid. We can only put it down to the fact that we were brown and nothing else whilst the other guests who walked through were not brown. Do not go here. There are plenty of better clubs in London and next time, we're going back to the good clubs where everyone is treated equally.

We were on no list but being shortly after 10pm we were hopeful that two well dressed young men may still be able to get in given how early it was. My friend who happens to be white went to the front door to ask a guy with a clipboard if it would be possible for us to get in. All signs were positive and I saw my friend pointing over to my direction and the clipbaord guy nodding. My friend walked back and said yeah its ok, we can just pay entry at the door. Good result or so I thought. After a further 15 minutes we arrived at the front of the queue when the fun began. The clipboard guy said to my friend ""so you two right"" but pointed to my friend and a blonde guy who was by himself in front of us. To which my friend replied ""no its me and my friend here"". And to anyone thinking I'm playing the race card or being sensitive I quote the clipboard guy ""no you told me you was with the blonde guy not the black guy"". He repeated this 3 times. My friend in shock tried to explain why he would say he was with the blonde guy when he has no idea who that guy was. One of the bouncers said ""he's with the black guy"". At which point the clipboard guy walked off inside in apparent disgust but not before telling the bouncers that we're not getting in. At this point my friend and I along with the bemused blonde guy who was on a list are all removed from the queue. I attempted to ascertain why it is a problem that he's with a ""black guy"" but also explain that we genuinely don't know this blonde guy so why is he also being removed from the line. Bouncer reiterated that we can't get in now its too late, the clipboard guy has made his decision.Not let people in because they are black without fear or recrimination in London in 2014 is abhorrent. Black celebrities dont count. After some research I see this is owned by those involved in Mahiki, The Punch Bowl and Whisky Mist. One only has to check Wikipedia or Tripadvisor to hear similar tales of these guys clubs turning people away due to skin colour. But as long as you can utilize closeness with the Royals you can still pack in the sheep.I I imagine there discrimination doesnt stop at race either!Negative stars if I could."

Neither of us are religious and we're both big fans of South Park, Beavis and Butthead, King of the Hill, Family Guy, etc., so we knew this production should be right up our alley. Only problem is, those tv shows are actually funny. Book of Mormon just isn't funny. The line ""I have maggots in my scrotum"" isn't funny  it's just stupid. It's really stupid by its 4th repeat. Writing a comedic play like this  particularly where they're toeing so close to the racism line  would take great satirical skill, which I thought Parker, Stone, et al., had in spades. Trust me  they don't. At least they don't show it here and the play does slip into some very unfunny racist views. This play is exactly what you would expect if it was written by two immature 9year old boys who just found out that farts are funny. Vulgarity, cursing, bodily functions  in the right hands, these can be the basis of great comedy see Mel Brooks. But it takes talent, and Parker and Stone's comedic talent is nowhere to be seen in this production. And that's what I'm criticizing  the comedy. It's just not funny. At all. But...the production values are very good. The cast NYC was great, the singing great and some of the lyrics were very clever. But again...funny No. Now, I know a lot of people think the play is hysterical and I've talked at length with them to find out what they found funny. And, usually, they can't point to anything  or what they do point to never holds up outside the theater. Try this with a fan: ask them to repeat one single joke from the play that was funny. Not verbatim  just the general ""funny essence."" I haven't come across one fan that can do it. They might think they can do it at first, but then, when the joke comes out of their mouth, I just look at them and watch their face as they realize  hmm...yup, that's not funny and sometimes you can see them realize: yup, that's racist. Mormonism, for better or worse, has plenty of fertile ground for vicious satire check it out for yourself on wikipedia or elsewhere on the net. The result should have been a hilarious play. Or, at least, a funny one. Or one that made you laugh. Or maybe think Nope  none of that. Instead, it mostly made me look forward to it being over so we could eat."

The music is excellent and the lyrics, though crass and filled with expletives, are smart and witty.  The staging is brilliant  somehow simultaneously over the top and simple.  The cast is phenomenal  Josh Gad is fantastically and lovably geeky.  My face hurt from laughing and smiling during this show, which is not something I experience on a regular basis. We plan to see it again soon.If you enjoy South Park, you will enjoy this musical.  My 73yearold father does not like South Park, but loved BOM.  However, in general, if you think South Park is intolerably offensive, you will likely not enjoy this musical.  I can think of a fairly long list of friends and family who would not be able to stomach this show  if you cannot laugh at your religion, are very literal in your religious views, and/or wouldn't be able to tolerate blasphemy in any context, you will probably hate this play.  However, most of the people I went with identify with an organized religious group including Christianity, Judaism, Unitarianism, and Buddhism, represent multiple racial/cultural backgrounds, and age groups 23 to 73, and we all enjoyed it very much despite the fact that there were parts of the play in which the jokes specifically targeted each and every one of us at some point.  The play pokes fun at just about everyone and everything  like South Park, they dont hold back when dolling out the jokes.  My husband and I were both speechless the first time we heard Hasa Diga Ebowai, but in the context of the show as a whole, we've accepted it as an undeniably catchy song with some pretty good points about the effect of human misery on faith. There are words in the show I would never use, and lines in the show that go against everything I believe in, but I would still recommend it to anyone but the most conservative of my friends and family.  I think it's ultimately positive about the value of religion and the joy it can bring us, and that there is an underlying faith in the inherent goodness of human beings, which is refreshing compared to the negativity we see in so many other forums."

After continuously asking for our tickets which we clearly showed to 5 different staff members including security. The manager turns up and tells us that unfortunately we are not allowed entry and should decide to look elsewhere as our tickets will be refunded within the next 24 hours. I can say for sure that we were not allowed entry due to the mixture of ethnic groups amongst us and the manager was clearly English as this is the exact same thing the bouncer stated also said that this has happened on several occasions and youre not the first ones. The bouncer apologized on behalf of the manager which i appreciate coming from the bouncer, However we were told that we will be refunded with our sum within 24hours as after speaking to the bouncer , He clearly said that the only thing i could help you with at the time being is an advice that you must get your payments now otherwise they will delay refund transactions and also said if they deny to give you the refund on the spot, Make them aware that you will make a complaint and escalate the matter further and eventually they will return your money which they ended up refunding in cash. However, this is very unacceptable from the manager as firstly throughout the conversation we had, we were very polite with him from the start and did not want to give him any reason however he still decided not to talk to us after we asked him the reason we are not let entry very politely and told us to move away from the site when they owed us 200!! Imagine paying for a service or for an event and you end up getting told that youre not allowed entry and move away from the site!when they clearly owe me my money!

Great for family for sure and food is quite reasonable, don't expect cheap food and also forget about 5 star services and taste in this kind of establishment. They are in the middle of nowhere, so logistic is difficult, which contribute to the slightly more expensive price tag.As for the pool, well, I heard my young nephew bout 12 y.o. were not given the access to one of the pool in front of the sunken bar possibly because of the alcohol charge he's too small and this particular pool mainly serves alcohol or maybe because it was just plain discrimination /racism. Honestly I did not see any other Indonesian in that part of the pool but me. For me, I did not encounter this case I just swim everywhere I like.

Signage, check; door open, check; looks cute, check...then it just got weird. Walked in with my husband and 13 y/o, looking for Christmas presents. The lady sitting at the front said, ""What are you interested in"" and I cheerfully said,""I'm interested in everything!"" She said, ""We don't do that here."" Which made me think she was joking that I had made some immoral suggestion. But no twinkle in the eye. ""If you know what you want, you tell me, but we don't like people coming in and just tracking leaves around."" My response, ""Delightful."" We promptly exited. It was so strangely offcue that we even speculated that she may getting demented, as people losing memory will get irritable and say things which don't always follow social cues well or seem out of character. Other reviewers have commented on her political rants or that she might be racist. There was a large pro Ben Carson sign on a rack next to the front door, so this would seem less likely. From the other posts it appears she treats many people similarly. Based on the one review which mentioned she was once friendly, I am now worried about her, hope she has friends/family to care for her! Otherwise, can only say it was painful."

Everything in the reviews before me are true from the blocking of the store, the constant questions about where you are from, and the distinct impression no browsing aloud. All that is bad enough, but the blatant statements about the confederate flag, newspaper articles she thrusts in front of you about the lies concerning the flag, and other comments we didn't stay to finish listening to were shocking.

With 'cad mle filte' emblazoned above the door which means a hundred thousand welcomes and both my husband and I being of Irish and Scottish descent, we thought we'd browse the cute shop  especially since there were kitschy, fun gift items displayed in the window.  Upon entry we were immediately asked what were were looking for and i advised her we were just browsing.  After repeating this conversation 3 times, we we're told 'thats not what we do here' and then the old nutter advised us that we didn't need to be browsing 'on this side of town' and needed 'to go elsewhere for that'.  As we walked out the door, we encountered a Hispanic family also just wanting to browse this cute shop on a cute street in the lovely town of Asheville, just like we wanted to do and the way they were treated was truly appalling.  This woman is racist, rude, and bad for Ashevilles business.  I'm still in shock from the experience as I've never been kicked out of a store in my life.  We are wellseasoned travelers, civil, well dressed, free of body odor  and oh yes!  We're Scots Irish!!!!  Not to mention, I'm a card carrying member of the DAR and had relatives who settled in Jamestown!  Yet this bitter old hag apparently chooses her customers based upon whim and only opens the shop to those SHE deems appropriate or worthy.   She uses her time at the front desk to spew hatred, cast aspersions, and and judge.  The Asheville Chamber of Commerce and/or BBB should get involved as she is a horrible representation of the lovely people of Ashevile, those of Hibernian descent, southern hospitality and the state of North Carolina.

You'll have to pay for a table with a minimum spend of 50 euros for drinks, per person, before you go in. Although I don't think that rule applies to the locals too.What puzzled me is why one HAS TO drink alcohol when clubbing!!! I suppose they should just say that the entrance is 50 euros,and that would sound better because not everyone drinks alcohol.  FYI We were in a group were not everyone drank alcoholNow, the price of the entrance fee or 'entry for alcohol' wasn't the main issue, but if I am going to spend my money, no matter how little, I should be happy to do so. I should not feel like I am paying my hard earned money and  begging to get into a place where I do not fell like I am welcomed.I personally found the manager, and the door man to an extent, 'power tripping'. I wouldn't go as far as saying they were racist, although his/their demeanour didn't leave me with many other options. I hate to say, but I would not recommend this club to a minority person/group. You're better off spending 1000 euros where you're welcomed than 10 euros where you are at best tolerated.One of the the manager's parting remarks was '...this is the best club in Bratislava'. But if he didn't get my reply on the night, and I know he'll probably get it now, 'I've been to clubs from Tokyo to London, Mexico to Dubai, and around the world, and I've found only one club worse than yours, and that's 'Coyote Fly' in Riga. 'Best' doesn't necessary mean what you can squeeze out of your patrons in terms of money, its the experience and your expertise in delivering'. FYI I did spend a hell of a lot more in another club where I felt welcomed.Cheers"

My friend who got inside asked a barkeeper to come upstairs with them to help us figuring out what the reason was. She translated, that they said, that its to full inside but they were still letting people inside, so that could not have been the reason, so me and my friends started arguing with the security people. After a while they started saying, that they cant let me inside because of my dress code, which wasn't the truth because I was wearing the same clothes like my friend, who got inside. The longer we were standing there the more we realized, that they only rejected girls that were either black or overweight. We got so angry about the discrimination they were doing that we started protesting and confronting them, that what they were doing was racist and not okay. A lot of the rejected girls started crying because they were so hurt by the way the staff of the club treated them. We started filming the situation to publish it, so everyone can see, what a club the octagon is. When they saw us doing that they got really mad and started pushing us away and slapping the phone of one of my friends hands. But in addition to that I have to say that NO ONE of the people in the line wanted to help us or stepped up for us and against those bullies and racists and wanted to help us fighting for our right.

I've been matched up with white, black and asian players and have never had a problem. To say lake spivey staff is racist is a joke. Maybe not always the friendliest, but racist no way. Could there have been a staff maybe that made a racist comment, maybe. But this is America and there are still people from all races that have short fuses with people of other races. Don't go with a chip on your shoulder thinking this place is racist, just go have fun at this course. It's a nice course with nice greens and very affordable. If someone makes a racial comment, just look at them and say God bless you and ignore any ignorance that goes on here or anywhere else in the world."

Almost like playing on dried red clay. However, the greens were all in excellent shape. I also enjoyed the hazards and level of difficulty.  Now on to the staff: Although the young gentleman in the clubhouse checking us in was quite pleasant and nice, there was an older gentleman that was rather unprofessional and rude as we checked in. So after making note of this obvious dislike for us, we made it through the 9th hole and once again the same older staff member made a few more rude comments. It was obvious he didn't want ""our kind"" there, which is weird because I've played at better and more expensive private courses without being treated like a second class citizen. What could have been an overall good experience was overshadowed by the racial undertones and unwelcomeness from this staff member."

Of course we all left to another club.Mind you I had heard other horrible stories of the staff being racist and rude to other people as well and a lot of people complaining about this, which sadly I didnt heed to. it would appear these racist acts are against black people or foreigners in general.

This was bad enough, and but the other responded by asking ""was he Jewish""  I was horrified and told the the clerks these comments were not acceptable, and that one did not talk about customers in front of others, nor should they disparage people based upon their supposed religion. Rather than apologizing, they told me that other Jews had been in the store and had been ""pushy"" so this made their comments ok. When I told them their comments were antiSemitic and racist they did not care and continued to argue with me about why they were right.  Do not frequent this store, they do not deserve your business.

I had a drink switched out because I was not satisfied with the taste but they still charged me for it without informing me. The bartender said that they couldn't take off the charge because only a manager could do it and the manager wasn't there which makes 0 sense. Then tried to insult my intelligence by saying that it was ""common sense"", if I ordered the drink I would still have to pay for it even though she failed to tell me this at the time of the exchange. She called this logic ""bar rules"" and that they practice these rules at every bar. Another male bartender chimed in backing her ignorance. She then told me to ""Just take it out of the tip because I wasn't gonna leave one anyways."" I was so shocked that I didn't even react.

The company employs and encourages Racist behavior. I and my wife had an awful experience in one of the tours to Grand Canyon and this post will reflect how badly the company manages and handles such Racist behaviour. I have travelled many countries but this was the worst Racist comment I've ever come accross. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE TOURS FROM THIS COMPANY.Following is the point by point story of this terrible experience.1 It was a single biggest mistake of booking a Grand Canyon tour through this company, Anyway, our tour coordinator Jeff a day before asked us to hop on the bus which has a signage of 18002 Grand Canyon on bus from treasure Island.2 We were putting up in Venitian Resort however Jeff insisted that the pick up point would be from treasure Island to which we agreed to and we were asked to reach the pathway of treasure island at 6.10 am.3 Around 6.05am we spotted a bus with the signage 1800Grand Canyon near treasure island and we were trying to find a door way to get on the bus. At that time, the driver was continuously honking at the car which was ahead of the bus. My wife went in front of the bus and asked the driver to open the door, to which his reply was get off the road in a very arrogant tone. He opened his window and told us that we are at a wrong spot again arrogantly and we need to be at the treasure island pick up point to which our reply was why are you shouting at us He shut the window off and he kept honking at the car ahead of us. And then, he continuously was honking for about 23 mins at a stretch at 6.05 am. This was a behavioural issue of first speaking to a Woman in that manner and then shouting at us of why we are standing at the wrong spot. This happened because we live in Venetian not treasure island, in no way we could've known the exact location of the pick up point and even if we we're at the wrong spot, the driver could've been humble enough to tell us that and show us some direction on where to stand, instead of was fuming at us.4 After the bus came at the pick up point, we went inside the bus, and he told us that we we're standing at the wrong spot. But since he was shouting at us earlier, I told him that this is not the way to speak to anyone and he needs to speak with us nicely. To which he started arguing about the situation and in that I told him not to spoil our morning and our trip to Grand Canyon and in that argument he said, I don't know how you two me and wife got in this country and he continued with his statement which was in relation to our Nationality and that nobody wants us here. This was a Racial remark against my community, nationality and to many such Asians especially Indians who are in the United States and such kind of behaviour is unacceptable. I told him to Shut Up and we decided to stay quiet since we did not want to spoil our trip but thought about registering an official complaint against the bus driver as well as the company who employs such folks which is disgraceful. 5 After speaking to their manager  DAN from Grand Canyon Tour Company he asked me to send an official complaint to the email ID, to which I did. The reaction was very subdued as if they have already decided to do nothing about it, anyway I emailed them giving them a full picture of what really happened.6 Since then, not even a single apology phone call or even a revert on my email is made by the company which is disgraceful.Therefore I urge all folks especially Asians who are in search of Grand Canyon tours to look somewhere else and not this company who employs Racist folks."

My husband and I did the ""VIP Hollywood tour"" though this company at the end of September when we went to Las Vegas and it was the biggest mistake of the trip.The website boasts ""luxury vehicles with WIFI"" but it was a Ford F550 bus As per Steve from guest relations on another Trip advisor review, the vehicle was to be one of their ""fleet of luxury Mercedes"", with no shocks, no legroom, no WIFI and 3 of the 5 TVs on the bus didn't work. To top it off, it's supposed to be a siteseeing tour, however they covered the bus in a black wrapping so you couldn't even see out the windows. It's a 14 hour tour. It was like riding in a trunk. picture attachedThe driver Nino made racist and derogatory comments about women and other cultures the whole day which we found very offensive.Not once did anyone tell us that there was no supper stop, or to pick up food at one of the stops, so we didn't eat from 1:30 when we had lunch, until 11:30 when we got back to our hotel. The website advertises a free ballcap, however when we inquired we were told that they were out, and to contact the main office. As per below, the main office doesn't respond to anything. At the Santa Monica pier we were told to go explore and meet back at the restaurant at 1:30. We got to the restaurant at 1:26 and were yelled at by the driver for being late.  Santa Monica we had less than a half hour. At each stop we were dropped off at some random point, given vague instructions and left on our own to see who knows what, we weren't told. At the Chinese theater in Hollywood the group was taken to a mall, directed up the escalators and then left by ourselves to figure out what the heck we were supposed to be looking for apparently the hollywood sign which we found out from another tour groupAbsolutely terrible tour. Waste of vacation time and money. What makes it worse is we've contacted the company multiple times, even spoke to a woman named Rose over the phone who promised she would handle it, and no one will respond. We've also contacted the better business bureau, who advised that this company has an F rating because they won't even respond to them regarding past issues.SAVE YOUR MONEY. Go with a credible company with inoffensive drivers with vehicles you can actually see out of."

But if you have a fear of heights, I'd advise not actually buying a ticket to walk on the Skywalk until you've seen it. It was the bus trip itself  and the bus driver  that spoiled what should have been a spectacular day.Scheduled for a 6:10 a.m. pick up at our hotel, we rose at 5:30 a.m. and were at the designated pickup spot by 6. When the bus arrived, we were told it was not the bus which would take us to the Grand Canyon  it was only a shuttle which would take us to the office of the Grand Canyon Tour Company  not at all what we were expecting. Once we reached the tour company's building, we waited outside in the parking lot for 11/2 hours before boarding our bus  then sat on the bus for an additional 15 minutes before leaving. One of the reasons we chose this tour company was because their website stated we would not need to disembark and wait for a shuttle once we reached the Grand Canyon  and that their  company was the only one allowed to drive onto the reservation This turned out not to be true  and like all the other companies' buses that came onto the reservation land, we had to take a shuttle to the three sites at the rim.  But it was all the delays and 'padding' during they day that made the trip tedious. Along the way to the Grand Canyon, we made a trip to the Hoover Dam Walkway  where the driver kept us on the bus in the parking lot for 5 minutes telling us what we were going to see. I mean, seriously We couldn't simply get off the bus and see the sight And, quite frankly, we saw just as much when we drove over the adjacent road later twice, so the 1/2 hour stop was unnecessary. When we arrived at the Grand Canyon at noon, the driver said he expected to leave ""around 3:15."" Given his penchant for repetition, it was surprising he only mentioned the departure time once and didn't tell passengers when to be back at the bus. It was less surprising when several of the passengers didn't return by the 3:15 departure time. We ended up waiting another 40 minutes until everyone was aboard and we could leave.During the 13 hour day, we were 'treated' to stops at two different gas stations, as well as racist and sexist comments from the driver plus complaints about tourists and how when driving on the Strip he liked ""to play a game where we get the bus as close to the pedestrians without hitting them."" We also got the 'benefit' of a 15minute hard luck story about how little drivers make and how he, the driver, did so much for the passengers because tips are important. Though the website and the sides of the buses proclaim ""Free Wifi"" there's apparently no service for most the area the bus travels through  so why advertise something that passengers can't actually access Power outlets were available in each seat row and the driver encouraged passengers to use them to charge their devices, but none of them worked the passengers tried them all. What should have been an amazing day turned into a 13 hour slog broken up by a 3hour visit to the stunning Grand Canyon. We checked other tour companies after our adventure and it's always going to be a long day  but this was still long in comparison. And the driver's incessant rambling only made the day feel longer."

We had absolutely no WiFi on bus 1963. The only time we had WiFi was when we parked next to another Grand Canyon Tour Bus at a rest stop and we could use their signal until we pulled away when we lost the signal immediately. They picked us up in a luxury bus, right on time, from our hotel. That bus then dropped us off at their ""terminal"" where we had to wait in a long line that snaked back and forth like at a theme park ride to reach a counter where we were assigned to our bus... Our bus was old, had window shades that you had to manually roll up by hand as they were broken, and offered no WiFi. Our driver used foul language over the P.A., and made racist as well as inappropriate comments directed toward our Japanese passengers who did not speak nor understand English. The driver showed us a pirated copy of a movie, and then proceeded to show us a pirated copy of a Las Vegas ventriloquist show that contained many sexual and homophobic innuendos. We were highly offended, as were the passengers sitting across from us. At the end of the tour, the driver told the bus load of people that since we were running late, he would be dropping some of them in a central location close to their hotels instead of at their hotels and they would have to walk. Lots of arguments ensued between the driver and passengers. We were not at all happy, and embarrassed for international visitors to Las Vegas and the USA who had to endure the time spent with this driver. The Grand Canyon was just beautiful and we were afforded plenty of time to take in its majesty. It's just a shame that the tour company permits a driver such as this man to represent them."

WOW.First impression  VERY disorganized!  The ""hotel to hotel"" pickup and drop off was not at our hotel, but rather a nearby hotel.  This was made clear to us when we reserved over the phone and was not a surprise.  However, what was not made clear was the bus we got on at ""pick up"" at a nearby hotel was not our tour bus. It was just a pickup bus.  We didn't know that's what we were on until we arrived at the tour bus company site and the bus driver finally said something to us.  We'd been on the bus picking people up and getting ourselves situated and never once did anyone tell us this wasn't our bus.  Actually, the bus driver never said 2 words to us other than clarifying our names before we got on the bus.  So we packed up our stuff again, in a rush to get off the bus, and were corralled into the ticket building where there was a long line went pretty quick, actually and 'breakfast'  a coffee station  individually packaged danishes you might see in bulk boxes from BJ's or Costco.  Not entirely impressive, but then again, what else would be expected.The feeling at this ticket building and the busses was complete chaos.  Employees holding doors open doesn't equate to an organized presentation.  No one seemed to know where to go to get to their bus.  We figured it out by watching others who had asked about their busses, but it seemed like a grand majority of patrons learned where to go by also asking other patrons.  Not a great way to promote on site safety, considering busses are coming and going and patrons are walking around the parking lot lost and confused. In addition, as I was first in the line for our bus, attempting to start an orderly line a safe distance from our bus aka ""in front of the bus, not between 2 busses"" a man walked up in front of where I was standing and declared himself 1st in line. Then came the rest of his family.  Apparently, in some countries he didn't speak a word of English you have to be hugging a bus door in order to be considered 1st in line.  So some sort of sign or placard that indicates a safe place to stand in line for each bus is something I would recommend  highly.After finally boarding the bus this process took forever while all passengers watched our bus driver do his pretravel walkthru we were on our way.  I must add that our bus driver didn't address anyone standing in line while he entered and exited his bus on numerous occasions.  We had been told the bus number by another bus driver, but some sort of acknowledgement we were in the right place  at the right bus, while we all stood there acting as this guy's audience for quite a lengthy time, would have gone a long way.  Maybe even a statement that he was doing a safety check and would be done shortly, or something.  Busses were leaving  what if someone in line was in line for the wrong bus numberOur bus driver was 'Texas' born and raised, but still, he was really good with regional facts, trivia, and typical tourguide humor.  He took his hands off the wheel a few times to point things out to us, but the ride was smooth and entertaining. His driving skills seemed to be really good.  Which brings us to the actual Grand Canyon West site on he Hualupai Nation lands.  WOW.  What a madhouse of chaos.  This place is a blue ribbon tourist trap. Are there views  YesIs the Grand Canyon a majestic site to behold Absolutely!Was every man, woman, and child treated like a  dollar sign    YES. Overwhelmingly, YES. It was a disenchanting experience before we even made our first of the 3 stops along the Hualapai Nation's West Rim tour.The first stop is a mock Hualapai Village.  The 2nd is the SkyWalk which you need to pay extra and can't take anything onto it with you  no phones, cameras, bags... nothing, and the 3rd is a scenic outlook over the canyon.  There is a large raised section of canyon wall a mound, of sorts that you can climb and see in 360 to the canyon, all around.  The location is super clean.  The employees were all extremely nice  pleasant. The bathroom facilities were clean, functional, and well kept.  The Grand Canyon Tour Company's bus company's box lunch was sufficient to address hunger, but that was it.  A bready sandwich, chips, and a cookie.  The bus was comfortable but the WIFI was a sham.  It's not that we 'might' get kicked off or have a bad connection b/c so many ppl are accessing it at the same time like the bus driver told us.  We know this because no one was on the bus when we tried to connect to it and it still wouldn't let us connect. The fact is, the WIFI does not work. It is not connectable.  The bus WiFi was a selling point when purchasing our tickets.  There were a few selling points, actually.  Among them were: the breakfast, box lunch, WIFI, and early return time.  I must note that the bus driver stated the WIFI would be very iffy, before we even left view of the parking lot.  He also noted that the company has been complaining to the WIFI provider about it and they're trying to get a better system in place.  So, this being known, it is safe to say the company knows it should be telling all ticket buyers this fact since WIFI is such a big selling point for this bus company, compared to others.The rest stop our bus made halfway to the Western Rim was at a gas station I like to refer to as ""the saddest place in America"".  Congratulations Arizona, you win the boobie prize for this one.  Bus tours stream through here numerous times a day.  I was aghast at how trashy the outside of this store was.  The bathrooms in the store weren't entirely impressive.  I'd call them 'marginally clean', at best.  And there were not enough stalls to address a bus load of people.Our time at the Western Rim was 'adequate', and I only say this b/c we purchased our tickets at a discount price. If we'd have paid full price for this my review would have been a more pointbypoint analysis of the tourist trap both of these operations truly are.  I expect more from an experience that takes me to an American gem and some of the most unique geologic formations on the entire planet.  People came from all over the world on our bus, alone to see this site.  What was offered all of us was 'adequate' on all fronts.What may be daytoday visual experiences for people who live in this region of the American Southwest is something tourists are likely seeing for the very first time.  This is a concept that is clearly lost to the bus company and the Hualapai Nation, per my experience on this tour.After finishing our tour of the Grand Canyon we still had 2 hours left to our 4 hour stay.  We wound up booking an onthespot helicopter flight, and that made our day complete.  It was very basic, but that was what we needed  a quick out and back.  It was pricey, and I think that's the point.  The more you spend, the better time you have at Grand Canyon West. This disappoints me  not because we don't want to pay to play, but more because 'this is the Grand Canyon'.  When you're surrounded by this much beauty and geologic history you shouldn't have to spend a fortune to enjoy your time while being surrounded by it.  IT should be enough.  There were no trails to walk on. There were no paths to traverse. No uniquely possible photo spots.Every single place we were corralled into so were, also, droves of other people.  Every visible area was saturated with bus loads of tourists.  There was not a single place of peace at this monstrous geologic site  not one.  If anyone was looking to have a spiritual experience at one of the most glorious places the American Landscape has to offer, the Hualapai Nation made it nearly impossible to do so.  As I mentioned, we did a helicopter tour to the bottom of the canyon and then a short river boat run.  The helicopter was safe and smooth, and well worth the trip.  It's pricey but worth it.  I suggest comparing prices of buying onsite vs. in a combo with your bus ticket, because I think there's a difference.  We went on a helicopter tour at the last minute because the rest of the sightseeing at the ""West Rim"" was such a disappointment.We arrived back at the bus 1 hour before our planned departure time, as reiterated by our bus driver.  He had told us he would stay with the bus so we anticipated he'd be there.  When we got there he was nowhere to be found.  More people showed up directly after we did, and they knocked on the bus door.  The weather had shifted and it went from cool and breezy, when we arrived, to chilly, windy and drizzling in the last hour, only, our driver was nowhere to be found.  A bunch of people stood between 2 busses to keep warm.  And more people arrived at the bus.  It was cold, windy, people were in shorts and short sleeve shirts, and we couldn't get into our bus.  People knocked.  Another bus driver of a different bus swore our driver was in the bus, so he knocked.  Finally, a couple minutes later another person knocked and up popped our driver. The ride home was ... bizarre.  That's the best way to describe it.  Our driver, whom we already considered ""racially insensitive"" understatement, due to his numerous racially driven statements on the ride to the Canyon, took to singing out loud  speaking a bunch of the punchlines to the dialog that was being played on a video he put in for us to watch.  I suppose it's nitpicky in a way But he puts a video in  a comedy show playing on the Las Vegas strip  and then he announces all the punchlines directly before the punchlines are delivered by the people in the video.  So it's like  why are we watching this  It was more weird than annoying, but he wouldn't stop and so we were trapped there as we listened to our bus driver predeliver the entire script, at points, of this video, and then awkwardly look back at us people in his eyeline for  what seemed to be some sort of approval.  It was weird. I'll definitely chalk it up to that.  I suppose it's when our driver started smacking himself across the face while driving us back to Las Vegas that I started to think maybe this guy has been behind the wheel a little too long.  And, when he made a small number of sexually inappropriate jokes  at the expense of women   which my husband found 'awkward' because there were women present we just sort of grimaced and cringed, speechless.  And if that wasn't enough, I have to laugh when I type this, my husband did not respond to one of the inappropriate jokes and so the bus driver clarified the punchline by enunciating loudly what he thought my husband simply did not hear.  When we finally escaped the bus he told me he didn't respond because it was offensive to women and not something he would want said in front of his wife me, so ignoring it was said at all seemed to be the most reasonable thing to do.  It was like the bus driver had no sense that his nature would be considered a mite bit inappropriate to the English speaking patrons aboard.We arrived back at the hotel by around 6:00pm  6:30pm.   Right before dropping off the first bunch of people at their hotel the bus driver reminded everyone that drivers don't make that much as drivers so tips are greatly appreciated, and the recommended tip amount is 15.00 to 20.00 per person.  Literally, the bus driver told us all it is ""recommended"" that the tip be for 15.00 to 20.00 per person.  We laughed at each other when we heard the driver recommend how much each person tip  we really did.  We were going to tip anyway  and we did tip him anyway.  It was the way it was said to the tourists, it was just  another awkward moment on this bus. We had started out our tour with racially inappropriate behaviors toward nonEnglishspeaking patrons.  We then listened to numerous racially insensitive remarks, which seemed to flow without a care in the world, fall out of his mouth between here and there.  We'd been made to stand out in the cold, wind, and drizzle while he slept in the bus he told us would be open and available to us during our time at the West Rim.  We listened to him make inappropriate sexist remarks  jokes, sing louder than the radio for a stretch of awkward time, verbally predict entire sections of a video he put on the tv's for us to watch, and we  watched in confusion as he slapped himself across the face on numerous occasions on the way home. But yah  please do ""suggest a recommended tip"" of 15.00 to 20.00 a person. By all means! Look at that, I'm chuckling again Hey, what kind of vacation doesn't create a quirky memory or twoMy advice for this tour company and this tour to the West Rim Hualapai Nation of the Grand Canyon is to just know what you're getting into.  I won't say don't do it, but I will say to read all the different ranges of reviews before deciding.  Read some good, some bad, and some neutral. It'll help you understand what others may have gone through and then help you determine how much you think it's  worth  to get to the Hualapai Nation lands  because you can drive there yourself quicker and easier.  We took this tour because it was convenient to have someone else drive we thought and there was supposed to be WIFI to keep us busy."

I went to 1 oak last night wearing smart open toed flats with two of my friends. We were behind some black ladies wearing smart clothes and smart sneakers. They werent let in because they were wearing flats. I was told the same. So we stepped back and were trying to make another plan of where to go when I saw the lady at the front letting loads of other women in wearing flats and sneakers. I spoke to her and she said its cause youre wearing open toed flats. If you want to return wearing sneakers then youll get let in ... but thats not true because the black ladies in front of us were wearing sneakers and didnt get let in. Clearly different rules for different people. I have been to 1 oak before and after this experience and the last one Ill definitely not be returning and would recommend nobody spend their hard earned cash in this racist pompous establishment.

I went on a girls holiday with three friends all 18, and we loved it. It's buzzing, an amazing night club, the staff are friendly enough, you meet all sorts of people from all around the world. At Opium, I spent some of my favourite nights in Barcelona, and it's definitely the best club I've ever been to. The music is great, the atmosphere is great. A good mixture of a good party but also it has a classy feel. You shouldn't have any problems getting in based on race despite some reviews you may read, I'm black, two of my friends are Asian, and we had absolutely no problem. The only thing I would say is to dress up and you'll have no issue. I'd definitely recommend getting on Isaac's guestlist using youbarcelona.com. You get free entry before 2am, fantastic. Perfect to avoid the 1520euro entry fee. The drinks are quite expensive but you can only complain so much when they're filling three quarters of your glass with vodka!I'd heard about Opium and read mixed reviews here on tripadvisor. Personally, I'd give the place a five star. There are all types of people there, locals and tourists from allll around the world. The smoking/outdoor area is awesome, we actually spent most of our last night in Barcelona tipsily bouncing around and dancing on the white sofas outside in the VIP area outside which was so easy to get into, even without wristbands with all of the new friends we'd made. Having read about racist bouncers and other peoples' racist encounters, I was very worried about going to Opium. Completely unnecessary! Can I just clarify that we had absolutely no problems getting into the club and did not encounter any racist treatment within or around it!"

A mixture of tourists mostly American and loaded Spanish kids: The uniform is pastel designer shirts for boys, black designer dresses for girls. Occasionally you see a desperate businessman in a suit trying to grab a girl half his age. They play Rick Ross and other chart rubbish, which they can't even mix properly. Oh and a beer is 9 euros. I imagine it's the place to be seen if you're a greasy poser. Avoid this dump."

And the last night; July 16, 2014 we decided to just hangout at a club by the beach. So, when we got there we heard the security man is arguing with another man. We didn't know why but we were guessing because the man didn't have proper outfit. But if it was that case ""the security "" didn't have the right to curse the other man out or wanted to fight him. The security man should just do his little damn job that he can only do, to secure. Next thing we noticed the other man just left  said ""F you"" to the security man. Therefore, the security man got upset and hit the guy who was already drunk in his head. The guy fell on the ground. And the security man went hiding. Police came and did nothing all because the man that the security man hit was Armenian. We heard Spain  Armenian do Not get along. Which my friends  I thought that was totally unfair. Because if it was an American the security man would have never done that. As an American, that club is so racist. I don't commend things like that. Never again I would go to Opium nor recommend anyone to go there. I will copy this and put it on every site so people can see what kind of people they are dealing with at ""Club Opium"" in Barcelona.

AMAZING,"Don't believe the bad reviews about this club, it s the biggest and the most tourist friendly club in Barcelona, you can meet people from all over the world dressed up and ready to party. Everyone dress up so if you are heading there with a snickers and expect the bouncer would let you in, do it on your own peril, my advice is dress up... This place gets packed almost every night of the week, drinks are 14 euros each, i think for a nightclub of this scale it s very reasonable... Some reviews mentioned rude staff and bouncers, in my 8 nights stay, i went there every night and i have never had anything but a smile or a nice chat with the staff, the drink costs 14 euros  may be to leave a one euro tip to the bartender think about it : ... because he will, you always win when you tip the bartender , about the bouncers if you are well dressed and you are handling yourself , they won' t bother you they are just doing their job, some of them are actually fun, had few chit chats with some of them,, most of the times you see some touristic police with them on the outside to secure the exit which is very good. Some reviews mentioned racist bouncers towards some, i think it might be true, but the true reason about it is to prevent some professionals to get in, but i think you can still get in dress well come early from the see side entry and go early for dinner , you are sure to get in."

The tickets are sold by guys hustling on the street, and I get the sense their contractors not employees, so they can wheel and deal on prices. Face value of the ticket is 30, but quickly if you show that youre waffling or wanting to make a deal, the price starts falling. We got 2 tickets for 30. Ive read that folks have scored a 10 pp price. So all in all, 100 for a couple hours entertainment would not be bad. But oh man, it was bad. When I decided to write a review, I read some others beforehand and actually the other reviews are spot on. I appreciate the fact that discomfort is necessary to affect social change and a lot of comedians aspire to do just that. I can also appreciate that some comedians can go overboard and if s/he has the misfortune to have a sensitive audience member, it can lead to a bad reviewthis should be a rare or occasional combination. HOWEVER, the show was replete with overt racism that offends a person of average sensibilities. The all black cast took their pound of flesh and then some. Worse yet, all but one of the six or so performers were talentless. The one who wasnt talentless would almost qualify to be a warm up act anywhere else. I hope this review helps.  "

I appreciate intelligence in my comedic favourites. Being a comedian is a tough gig and requires skills most dont have. Hence why people can charge money for being good at being funny. It requires smart wit, on the spot thinking and stage charisma. These guys had very little of those things. My opinion is not king, however, I feel that when a comedian uses mostly only insults to the crowd, racism, sexism and stereotypes  Im wondering why youre in the job If youve lost that much sincere interest in your writing, why are you there And thats sort of the vibe that came across too  they didnt want to be there. Its easy to stereotype, thats almost copying every other try hard out there. Its easy to insult, were naturally quite judgmental. Its easy to be sexist, we havent long moved past gender imbalance, most current generations remember it. And racism is a problem thats very much alive and is actually considered a crime where I am from. Racial discrimination isnt tolerated in my country. Their shows were easy. I could have gotten up there and done more or less the same gig if thats the clubs Level of expecation. Im not a precious type at all, in fact, I laughed a fair bit. Problem here is that I will have a giggle at most things. I laugh at myself. When Im alone.And I dont mind a bit of banter, its my favourite game. But this was too far.There were two blokes out of I think 6, that really werent too bad. They were funny without having to pull apart the crowd without distasteful talentless linecrossing. 3/10"

He pointed to someone else and said, you know you are afraid of himYou know when you are getting in a plane and you hear Arabic, you are like I am not getting on here. This is about to blow up. I gave him a thumbs down and got up to leave, when he said, did I offend you.   I responded, this is Islamophobic, you are a fueling hate. It is not funny, and it is not okay. He replied, fine if you dont like it, leave. Just take your ugly face out of here. In defiance, I took a sit on the front row. I was not about to let an Islamophobic and racist individual intimidate me.  For the remainder of his act, he made rape jokes targeting me. He told me to leave again, but I didnt. His rhetoric got worse and he began inciting violence in the audience. He encouraged one girl to beat up the people who had walked outAt his point at least 7 people got up and left. I love comedy, it is a coping mechanism for a harsh world. I tend to have a dark humor and I am okay with being made fun of. I went there to laugh. Yet the problem is that Islamophobia is never funny. Inciting violence is never funny.I had managed to keep my composure throughout the show, yet as soon as the Colosseum was over I broke out into tears. On my way out, the show, several people came to thank me and to tell me how sorry they were. My response was to ask them why they didnt walk out. One of the individuals who approached me said, I wanted to see what he would say next, it was a car crash. But it wasnt funny. I am so sorry.  Herd mentality compounded by a comedian spewing hate is lethal during an administration that empowers islamophobia and misogyny. Ravi the person the comedian targeted said the following: He didnt ask my name or where I am from or what language I speak or what is my religion. He was just looking for someone to make that joke and selected me because I am brown. This is a stereotype...What scares me is what he is speaking could percolate into the minds of the audience and lead to violence. It might reach the minds of people like Adam Purinton in Kansas City. Recently, Purington fired a weapon that killed Srinivas Kuchibhotla and injured Alok Madasani. He did this after screaming a familiar phrase which I heard at this show, get out of my country terrorist. What gives me hope is that for every hateful incident, I know there are 10 people who oppose it and stand up.Ravi is a software engineer that came from India looking for opportunities. He grew up watching Nova and dreamed of being a scientist in the U.S.After the incident I went to speak with the manager.As I spoke to her, she smirked and rolled her eyes. When I pointed out she was not taking this seriously, she said: its my face. I asked, will you continue to book him. She said, there was nothing she could do. Someone began recording the conversation.She threatened to call the cops as she said it was illegal for bystanders to record her. She said, delete that now or we will call the cops. At this point, I told her I was walking out unless she was going to hold me against my will. She told the guard to stand by the door until the police arrived. The people recording were afraid and deleted the  conversation. She had succeeded at intimidating them."

Racist, terrible terrible comedy  appalling business model","Before I begin, I've been to LOTS of standup around the world, and I've even performed myself a few times. So I don't use the term 'racist' lightly. More on that later. Also, I have done over 40 tripadvisor reviews and this is my first EVER '1star'. Once you've bought your ticket, the club itself makes you buy a minimum number of drinks/food to stay or they kick you out  effectively doubling the ticket price, but just enough to stop you walking away. On top of that, they have people selling tickets on the street lying to you saying 'you get two free drinks with the ticket' or 'insert famous comedian is performing a secret gig to test material' which isn't always out of the question in time square to a naive tourist. While this isn't the club directly, they clearly weren't surprised to hear this when I told them. So from the start the audience has been lied to, doesn't want to be there and is pissed off.When I was there, they were running two shows simultaneously slightly different start times so that they always have something about to start, both with about 15 people in the audience  with the 5 or 6 comedians running between the two stages presumably repeating the material. I felt sorry for them to be honest, it's a dreadful venue and some of them were OK I'm being very generous here  I've seen worse once or twice. However, the final act who I won't name kept picking on the only black person in the room  making comments like 'are you carrying drugs, I know most minorities are' and blaming the audience for not laughing at other comments because they were 'PC'  rather than perhaps realising he wasn't funny. I've honestly NEVER seen racist material on stage before I'm 30 and from the UK and I really didn't expect it in NY of all places.I actually asked the guy who was picked on afterwards what he thought  turns out he was a professional standup comedian and he thought it was racist too. We bonded in a bar over a few beers and how unbelievably terrible the whole evening and set up was and it was honestly the best part of the evening. AVOID AVOID AVOID.To be balanced, all the ingredients were there for a good comedy club venue  they just need good comedians and a ticketing structure that doesn't leave people hating the place. For the sake of comedy and comedians everywhere, in the nicest possible way I hope this place goes out of business or improves!. Management, come at with your comments  I'm so ready for you, you have no idea."

When we came to the place, we were forced to order two drinks or snacks each  cheapest at 6. After that, there was an additional mandatory tip of 19 on the receipt and then a tax for all of that, including the tip.The show itself was very unprofessional and all the speakers were talking about similar topics: mostly poor racist jokes.

Show times are flexible and you can use the ticket over a wide range of time.  We used the 10:15 PM show time and a midnight show time followed after hours.You are ushered upstairs to the fourth floor and eventually admitted to a darkened, smaller room that may hold about 30 people with a variety of tables.Did they tell you there was a minimum two drink limit per person which will add another 40 a couple onto the bill.  In fairness, I believe that all the New York Clubs may have that caveat.On to the show.  The host comes out and attempts to warm up the crowd with a barrage of racially sensitive verbiage I wont even call it comedy as it is anything but.  Behind us sits two young ladies that were obviously there to laugh at anything that was said or not said.  The host berated them about their moral low ground and they laughed even harder.  This was getting really hard to endure.The first comic was actually not bad and we thought, sans host, this is funny.  However, the remaining four comics who do about 710 minutes each; were terrible and I believe, they thought the more F bombs they dropped the funnier they were.  The last performer was the worst!   As people began to leave in the middle of the act, we left as well.  This was painful to sit through.  Do yourself a favor and do not subject yourself to this torture.  Summary, the cost is cheap and you still do not get your moneys worth.  I am no prude and have heard adult comedy tastefully done, this was anything but!  This was a night filled with racial, sexual and personal attacks with a deliberate attempt to demean a minority that dared to attend.Spend your money elsewhere."

What can I say, was a fantastic night. Firstly I thought I wouldn't get in as I was dressed as Alan from the hangover complete with baby Carlos and was suprised to be welcomed in. Secondly the music was awesome. I stayed in the house/dance bit most of the night although the RB bit eas pretty good too. Didn't like the cheesy pop section but that's just a matter of taste. There were 1 or 2 idiots in the club but you seem to get that in places with a high footfall like this one. Some people just can't handle there drinks I suppose! Which brings me onto the subject of drinks prices. I would have given this a 5 out of 5 if I didn't have to remortgage my house for a round of drinks. That was the only spoiler really but it seems to be the way of things to charge a fortune for drinks in a  nightclub. I noticed a few accusations of racism on previous reviews.

To start, I have always been a fan of cameo Bournemouth because of its four areas and popularity bringing in a diverse group of people, mainly I enjoyed seeing familiar faces. That is about where the benefits of visiting this venue ends. The floors are often sticky, mainly in vinyl, but also in other areas. The drinks are far too over priced and there is a lack of selection, for example there is no beer on tap and if your planning to purchase a 330ml bottle of Budweiser or Becks on a weekend expect to pay around 4.50 this is probably one of the cheapest drinks on offer excluding shots., please note these prices don't apply on a Wednesday where drinks are a good value for money but other factors can still lead to a disappointing night. Staff I mean staff excluding security do a very good job in general and are always positive when serving and happy to help. One factor of the low rating regarding this review is the overcrowding which mainly occurs on a Saturday night where you feel as if you are in a constant cue and if you were unfamiliar to the venue I wouldn't be surprised if it took you 30/45 mins to find the way out. The ultimate factor in which leads me to believe that I will never visit again is the SECURITY.This is where this review begins to get more than just an aesthetic and personal review but it also shows the morals in which this nightclub upholds please note I am a male, a young male just like a third of the clientele this venue receives. Earlier this evening or should I say morning I was previously in Bournemouth on a night out and I decided I would meet some friends in Cameo Bournemouth not thinking there would be any issue with me entering as I have previously been able to enter throughout all stages of the night although, maybe not so late as this instance. I approached the doorman and roughly 4/5 others at 02:05am to be told that I could not enter due to the grounds of the club being now closed for entry, although I found this shocking as the club was not due to close until 4am I wasn't bothered to much of an extent because I could understand that they needed to stop entry at some point. I then called my friend and alerted her that I could not gain entry and I would either go home in a taxi or wait for them to leave, HOWEVER! While I was on the phone I could see a member of the security telling two girls that I had recently been told the venue was now ""closed"" and that they should wait out of sight until I had disappeared. I did not disappear! while the two girls were waiting across the road staring blankly at me waiting for me to leave, I also saw another girl gain entry shortly before the two girls previously mentioned proceeded to cross the road to gain entry for a second time. Cut story short, all three girls gained entry after I had been told it was closed and that I would not be able to gain entry under any circumstances and when I approached members of the security of course they are unable to reason with. This leads me to believe that the club is sexist and just not worth a visit if you care about equality. The club has recently been in the news for being racist, at first I was apprehensive, but after receiving this appalling quality of service today I am now sure that this was a genuine act of discrimination that the company carried out and its a shame to see that the same is still happening to this day. This venue needs to learn that people should all be treated equally no matter who they are because although they think they might know who they're dealing with in terms of customers that have an influence of the reputation of the business, they really have no idea and to treat customers in this way is unacceptable."

I was with a group of well off, well dressed girls and they didn't want to let us in  only when they fouund out one of my friends had connections were we let in. Outside the club everyone who was turned away was black or asian. So disgusting. I didn't want to go in but the rest of my friends did so I went in but felt disgusted with myself afterwards. Inside  the bouncers were obviously told to push black and asian people away from tables if they weren't sitting there  literally pushed away. It was only when I started crying out of pure frustration and anger did they seem to feel ashamed. Please my black and asian people  if you do not want to be made to feel like a slave/second class citizen, do not waste your money paying for a taxi to it's far out location just to be turned away at the door and looked down on.

I used to love White and I would recommended it to everyone. Used to go every week to the Urban Nights on Saturday. Last Friday I decided to try out another night at White and bring along my friends from Switzerland. I told them how great White is and that we will have an amazing time.We did not have a reservation that night so we went to the walkin queue. It was 4 of us and we thought we were dressed appropriately for a club of this type just to find the arrogant person I can't say lady, because ladies don't behave that way at the door looking at us from HEAD TO TOE! Even if you want to check people's dresscode there is a discreet way of doing so rather than shamelessly looking a person up and down with an arrogant smirk on the face. Do you think that people are that desperate to get into this club Before the person even answered with yes or no, we turned around because we are not desperate and we don't tolerate lowclass behavior like that..... There is something called : RESPECT and this is a value you should teach your staff.I understand that this person makes up for her nonexisting manners and brains with her looks, but she doesn't even recognize an Herve Leger dress : which she probably can't afford anyway so I don't blame her there. I suggest you post the following list on your website/social media:""Rules and regulations for White wear your highest heels : everyone loves girls who can't walk in 15cm heels flats are just ""so not classy"" wear your shortest skirts and by short we mean it should look like a top and you just forgot to put pants on skirts that cover thighs or go below the knee are just not acceptable  we suggest you wear 1kg of make up, bright Ronald McDonald lips and Courtney Love Eyeshadow and Liner  we don't want you to have fun unless you are ready to spend over 10k  the walk in line is there to humiliate you so don't bother we do support racism and disrespectful behavior we are here to ruin your weekend ""This club is now on my blacklist, probably not for long since I am sure they will rebrand it in maybe a year or so, like all clubs in Dubai....

While we were there several people just walked in. When we asked the doorman why they were just walking in, he said that single women were allowed and people who had booked tables. At least 100 people who were not all couples, or single women must have walked in. When we protested we were told that they had a door policy of either reservations or couples entry. This was difficult to understand as we were 2 couples and we were appropriately dressed in elegant casual clothes and had in fact come from two other clubs. The doorman was noncommunicative and almost hostile when we asked him why we were being asked to stand outside and not allowed to enter. We left the place and then spoke with the Manager of the place, Mr yehya , on the phone , who was nice and apologetic but could not explain why we had been refused entry .  He informed me that the doorman was a certain Mr Ali but did not know his last name. I would not like to label the place as racist , but their policy seems to be to keep foreigners out. I think in a place like Dubai which encourages tourism , and where every other place is welcoming, the experience at White lsft a bad taste in the mouth."

Tried several different times. They kept telling all the black ppl that it was a private party on the third floor so they couldn't go up. However, they would let all the white ppl go in just fine. Finally, when I couldn't take hearing that line again, I asked the gentleman how he knew that I was not there for the private party. Wait for it. ...... He said because they had a list, but there was no list in his hand. I asked if he could check to see if we were on this ""list"". He called for the manager and the mgr came down to speak to us. When I told the mgr what was said, he admitted that there was no private party or ""list"". He said we were probably denied admission bc of the dress code. I then pointed out that we were ALL dressed very nicely bc we attended a semiformal cocktail party right before coming down to Beale St. After giving us all a look to check out our attire he then told us that we could pay 20 pp to get in.... no problem.  FYI: We watched the door for along time and NO WHITE PPL  paid anything to go to the 3rd floor. I was sooooooooo embarrassed that this was happening in front of our of town guest that I brought to Beale street to have a good time. Even more embarrassed that the black workers I talked to admitted that they were aware of what was going on and still worked there. I really used to love going to this place. Before the constant blatant racism, I visited this establishment over 20 times. Bottom floor had live music until it turned into a club sometime after midnight. The 2nd floor is the urban floor. Lots of ganster rap and music of that nature. Hardly any whites go to this floor. Once the 2nd floor closes, everyone from that floor goes down to the 1st floor since it's transitioning from a live band to a rb/rap dj at that point.  The 3rd floor used to be predominantly white, but had a sprinkle of nonwhites. This floor plays pop mixed in with current and old school jams. The 3rd floor crowd was as diverse as you could get for a memphis club which is why I preferred this floor. I lived in Nashville for 10 years so it was refreshing to see a club with a semimixed crowd in memphis. This floor stays open all night until the entire place closes. If you don't believe they are racist just stand outside the club and watch the entrance to the 3rd floor. White ppl get in no problem... no matter how they are dressed. A black person can get in ""if"" he A. goes in with a BIG group of white pplB. PaysOn the weekends, they even have guys standing outside of the club and at the corner near blues city cafe giving ""Free"" wristbands to get in the club on the 3rd floor. However, they only give these to white ppl and will make up a lie whenever they are approached by black ppl as to why they can't give them one. If you're black and don't believe try it. If you're white and you don't believe me watch a black person try. I'm leaving this bad review after being denied admission over 5 times due to the color of my skin. "

This can be perceived as racist by some but In reality it is not, I'm African American, I travel a lot for business and have been to top clubs in Miami, Cali, etc its very similar in short, club 152 Third Floor only is a club in such a manner where your looks and demeanor can go a long way.  Now My honest review, DrinksVery Good They have some of the best bartenders in Memphis even when it is very crowded, You Are Served promptly and QuicklyServiceThis goes either way on some nights the place is just over run you may get your drink fast but it may take triple the time to cash out if you have a tab going, the waitress usually take their time getting to you if you have bottle service, and depending on your bartender they MIGHT compensate you with an extra drink here or there, certain bartenders have their style of bar tending I prefer to go to the side bar not the main one next to the dance floor I've always gotten quality service there.DJThis is where this place shines the DJ IS EPIC on the weekends if you like dubstep rap mixes and other pop music if not you wont like the atmosphereAtmosphereTypical club, laser lights , couches , and a mini stage.For A club with no cover that try's to maintain that upscale feel to it its a pretty nice place but It does have its downfalls.NotesI've been to this place with great service, and terrible service, the main thing to watch out for will be how the bartenders treat you, I'll never forget the one time a Bartender through My amex card at me upset because I didn't tip before she even realized I Tipped in cash, this one time event almost ruined the place for me but I gave it another try, Be WARNED some bartenders attitudes are piss poor but the majority are the most humble people and really want your service."

They even made up some story about having to know 2 other members in order to get membership.  Complete BS. We'll never go there again and will tell others to stay away as well.  We decided to spend our money elsewhere Max Cocktail Bar and the Mexican."

Well my friend who wasn't very drunk btwspoke to him and I turned around, all of a sudden he pushes both of us out of line. This was a blatant physical assault on two women who were half his size.

They let everyone in front of us inline inside the club for free who happened to be white. When it was our turn they said we had to pay for each of us to get in. The bouncer became very nasty and rude with me because I did not have enough cash for both of us to go in because we expected it to be free. I asked to just pay for myself to go in to use their ATM and come back to the door to get my husband. The doorman yelled that he was not giving me that option, the conversation was over and that we needed to leave. I was shocked because I had not done anything to be treated like crap. I spoke to another guy outside that claimed he was the owner and he yelled that he didn't want to hear what we had to say because he was not letting us in. It was all so surreal. They had no real reason not to let us since we were both dressed appropriately. We ended up missing our friends party due to this bars racially discriminatory practices. I will be filing multiple complaints with the Office of Inspector general, the states attorney general and any other place I can go to. Do not patronize this place. They have a history of discriminating against anyone that is not white. Look up their Yelp reviews for evidence.  I suggest that everyone else that has experienced this treatment from this bar to report it. They need to be shut down.

At this point we are at the front and have been since I first spoke to him, he takes extra long to check our IDs which Im now absolutely freezing and unhappy Ive had to wait. So I take out my ID and show him, trying to speed up the process and very agitated. He says youre not coming in tonight, I told you you cant come in yourself, obviously looking for a reaction to this bs statement.. ofc I take the bait, Im half buzzing, freezing and not in the mood. He lets in all the girls and once again stops me and tells me I cant go in. I explain the people I was waiting for have been around me for almost 20mins now. Still nothing youre attitude isnt getting you in tonight I was told. Clear, blatant, racism.I have a friend who used to do security at nightclubs, he told me sometimes a game bouncers play is to see how many people you can reject for no reason, but always targeted black males. Horrible club and people.0 stars."

A group of nine 4 guys, 5 girs of us went there to celebrate the end of our exams, but we were separated into a group of six and a group of three because the last people were not ready just yet. I was in the first group. We arrived, entered almost immediately and then just waited for the rest while dancing and having a drink until we got a message by them saying that they are not letting them in. So, we went upstairs to see why the were not allowed in and we got nothing. After asking the bouncer ten times, all he said was their attitude was not okay. This is probably were I should mention that my friends were there guys from India. At first, we thought they didnt let them in because they were all guys without girls you know how clubs in Glasgow work sadly..., however as soon as we were told no by the bouncers for the last time and left, we saw them letting four white guys in. The same thing had happened last month when I was there with a different group of people and my male Latino friends were not allowed in.This kind of behaviour is unacceptable in this period of time, and especially in such a popular club in Glasgow. The staff that watched the whole thing did nothing so its not just the bouncers to blame. I was so disappointed by a place that I used to love going to and myself and everyone that was there will most certainly wont be coming back.If youre a person of colour avoid this place at all costs!"

Our whole group were made up of a range of ages and races of people who were sober, acting respectably and were all dressed very smartly eg suits and dresses. We were told once by a bouncer wearing a beanie hat ""not tonight."" As we prebooked a booth and were on the guest list, we repeatedly asked for a reason why not and after repeatedly ignoring us we were eventually told to move on and get out of the way. Myself and two of my best friends then asked ""if we go and stand in the normal queue do we have a chance of getting in"" Referring to all of us He then replied that yes the three of us young white females would get in and we should stand in the queue. At the same time we heard one of the girls on the door talking on her radio saying that a group was coming in and to keep a both free but she was quickly shooshed and told that no, our group was already told by him that we weren't gaining entry and have no chance of getting in. We watched as groups of people who were very drunk and in much worse states than ourselves were allowed entry over us. The clear reason that we were rejected is because he didn't like the look of the people we were with skin colour/slight accent so being disgusted with the treatment we received we then swiftly moved on to the next club down, Lola's, which had absolutely no problem letting us in whatsoever unbiased and non racists, after telling the bouncers in the Lola's of the treatment we received they also agreed that we were grossly mistreated. All in all the outcome of our story is that we won't be giving Kushion our money again as anyone that treats paying customers this way doesn't deserve our custom and we will be telling all of our friends about it. Perhaps they should train their staff to reject people who will actually cause a problem instead of misjudging people who were clearly out for a fun night with their work mates before Christmas and not looking to cause any trouble at all."

They said to quote ""you people are not welcome here"" I was taken aback by this comment. So for further clarification my cousin asked what do you mean by this She replied ""Your kind"" and as I am black and so was most of my friends. But yet the club are more than happy to play music from the black culture... Do not give this company a single Euro as they are a racist establishment. Who refuse to take money from a black people as apparently it is not good enough for this venue... I hoped to enjoy my stag in Germany and a night out in this venue. But in my experience please avoid this place, and further down the road in the Reeperbahn, there is a place called Club Hamburg.

You should not give them any of your money. The bouncers are discriminatory and racist. They were unwilling to let one of our friends in, just because of his race. They put it down to how he was dressed, but he was dressed to the same standard as the other men entering the club. It was clear that this was the reason, as it has happened before to other friends of mine.After attempting to have a reasonable discussion with them, they kicked us out of the line. In an attempt to receive clarification from another member of staff, we were simply disregarded. Understandably, the bouncers are able to decide who is allowed to enter and who isn't. However, this was clearly an issue of race. As a result, I feel it is necessary to point out that the people who work here, who represent the attitudes and values of the establishment, are perpetuating a racist policy. The staff here are prejudiced and evidently attempt to create a specific image for their brand, founded on skewed ideals of how both men and women should look and dress. This is even more preposterous considering this club is perhaps one of the lowest in terms of quality and clientele in Barcelona, therefore its concern for creating a specific image doesn't reflect its position in the Barcelona nightlife scene. I've spent a year living in Barcelona and there are plenty of other establishments that are far better to spend a night. I will never return and I will strongly insist on others to avoid this club. Not only because of the racist actions of the staff but also because I can almost guarantee a negative experience."

One of my three friends was also going to see the Waitomo glow worm caves, but had previously called the intercity office and was told that we would all be riding on the same bus. While the return trip from Matamata was lovely, our experience en route to Matamata was unacceptable.After arriving to the bus terminal at Sky Tower half an hour before our 8am bus, we were unsure what line we were supposed to wait in. We got in the line for Hobbiton but, because we were unsure, one of my friends went to ask one of intercity's employees if we were in the correct line. She told us that we were while addressing my friend as if she were a small child and not an adult paying customer with a legitimate question.After being condescended to, we waited in the Hobbiton line until we reached the woman working at the counter. I told this woman my name, but she couldn't find me on her list.  Eventually she determined that we were in the wrong line and then physically shoved me out of the way of the next customer.Having been physically shoved by one of intercity's employees, we then ran to the other end of the terminal to the other bus. Here my friend continuing on to the glow worm caves was told that she was not on this bus with the rest of my party despite previous assurances that we would all be traveling on the same bus and the previous confusing, rude instructions of other employees. We then were split up and I did not see my one friend for the rest of the day.While on our bus ride to Matamata via Hamilton, we at one point stopped so that one woman could use the bathroom. The driver announced that this would be the one chance to use the bathroom before we arrived at Hamilton, though did not specify how far away we were from Hamilton. As such, roughly half a dozen or so people got off the bus to use the bathroom. After these people returned to the bus, the driver got on the microphone and  specifically addressing the women who got off to use the bathroom, and not the men  told them that they were rude and inconsiderate for needing to use the bathroom and it was their fault that some passengers might miss their connections and that it was cutting into his break time, and that next time they should use the bathroom before getting on the bus.Beyond this just being incredibly tone deaf and only addressed at the women who got off the bus, and not the men, this was wildly unnecessary. If we were on such a time crunch, the bus driver should have just told the bus that we would be in Hamilton in forty five minutes, instead of implying that we still had a ways to go. Publicly shaming women and not men for getting off the bus to use the bathroom is entirely inappropriate.Meanwhile, my friend on the other bus listened to her bus driver explain how the Maori people were ""barbaric."" This sort of racist rhetoric is entirely unacceptable for reasons I hope are obvious.I would like to reiterate that the return half of our trip was lovely and I have no complains about the way that I was treated on that leg of the trip. But I think it is unacceptable for employees to condescend to paying customers, shove paying customers, shame paying customers for having to use the bathroom and then only shame the women, and then spew racist rhetoric. I expect better from Intercity, and was severely disappointed by the way I was treated. Would not recommend taking the intercity bus out of Auckland Central."

The bus driver requested me to put my 28L backpack at the storage space behind the van as the space inside van is limited, where I said I can put on my thigh as I have expensive laptop and DSLR camera inside. The driver answered impatiently: well, that's your choice ! Later on I put my backpack on the seat just for five minutes and went to the toilet. When I was back to the van, the bus driver told me : you put your bag on the floor or you pay extra charges ! The way he talked was so rude like I had done something shameful. I feel embarrassed by him in front of others passengers.  Well, I never said that I will occupy an extra seat for my backpack, as I will just put on my thigh or floor and it definitely won't affect the other passengers. What made me more angry is that the van actually had more than enough spaces where the seat beside me was actually empty ! The bus driver attitude was unacceptable.

Some were dressed up more, some dressed much more casual than us.body size wise, everyone was about the sameso the only visible difference with us was race because everyone else was whitewe were also the only same sex people showing affection while waiting in linebut everyone before us and after us were let insidewe were rudely told to leave without reasonWhen my wife asked why and pointed out the bias, the bouncer said something to the effect of yea, whatever, so what, I dont care.Seems there are similar situations happening from reviews on various platforms about this place. So one must ask, does the management here have the same prejudices if they see these reviews and do nothing to terminate these bigots I hope nobody spends money at this kind of discriminatory establishment."

The bouncers 6 in total boldly admitted to not granting us access due to the fact they did not like us. On the first attempt to enter the club roughly at midnight, I was alone with my friend from Angola and the bouncers stated that because we were two men we could not enter although there were groups of 34 men entering at once. We left no questions asked and went to pick our female friends from Mexico. Roughly 30 minutes later we were once again denied entry, we noticed several other groups entering the club, all of them white German groups please bare that I am a White male. At no point were these individuals stopped or questioned for any reason. Upon reaching the entrance the bouncer stated without any question asked. I did not allow you in 30 minutes ago and I will not allow you now. At that point, I calmly requested the bouncer/s to clarify the reason for denying our entry since at first instance I could understand not being allowed for entering with another male friend. This time I had two women with me. The answer I received was; I dont need an answer. I dont like you and you will not go in now, or ever!.He order me to go away and upon requesting to get their names, security and any type of identification clearly stating that I would make a formal complaint about them, I received a hostile response and was once again told to leave. We then asked whether or not we were being discriminated against, and the bouncer responded with a sure.As mentioned I am White man that is enraged at the fact that anyone imposes such racist authority over a minority, specially in GERMANY in the 21st century. I am speaking on behalf of my friends who accept this kind of treatment not because they think its ok but because they are foreigners and this is the norm.I hope to hear an answer from a House of Weekend Representative explaining what type of actions they will implement before I decide to press charges if necessary to the German authorities and antidiskriminierungsstelle."

I am a tourist and it was my first visit to Berlin. I went to that club and i was shocked and stupefied by the strange reaction that the bouncers did. We stood in the queue like all the others waiting to get in. We were two guys. In front of us there was a group of guys around 5 and thebouncer let them get in. As our turn arrived, the bouncer simply looked at us, didnt even let us talk, and directly smashed us with the famous sentence you cannot enter, too many boys. The point behind all this story is the following:We do not look Europeans and we have a Jewish look.The bouncers were three NeoNazis two of them had the perfect look of neonazisThe club is typically antiSemite and anti all dark people.The club simply is bad for Belin because the city itself is magnificent and simply great.

The bouncer himself admitted to being unprofessional and continued to condescend my friend. Smoking whilst talking to us, using racial slurs and yelling for 45 minutes wasting our time that could have been spent at any another club. We chose Bang Bang as we expected quality service and a good night. When my friend apologised, he was labelled as being desperate Im so sorry but do they honestly think we want to get in that badly Bang Bang should seriously reconsider its employees and systems. There was also an unofficial smoking corner with males smoking and we went there to smoke. However we were then told we couldnt smoke there while two men beside us were allowed to continue smoking in that same area. Conclusively, it was the most disgusting experience in my life.

It is a very RACIST environment for locals  Asians, not by from crowd but the staffs, they treat customers with different colours differently. A very WHITE SUPREMACY place to enjoy your night, you can have your privilege here and enjoy your night as long as you are WHITE.I made a reservation in the afternoon last Friday hoping to book for the sofa table by the edge, but they told me it's only for a crowd of 10 but not 5, which I understood so at the end booked a small table in the middle instead.Arrived at the place around 10pm, took the small table but saw there were only 3 ppl sitting on the sofa table next to our table, Caucasians customers to be exact. Didn't suspect much cause thinking there would be more people joining that table. 11pm another 2 Caucasians customers showed up and joined that table, and 5 of them sit there until 12pm then they left. So basically you don't need to have a crowd of 10 to book that table, you just need to be WHITE.So after they left the table we asked the staffs if we could switch over to that table, of course they told us that it had been reserved. Sure, after half an hour no one showed up and we asked again if we could switch over, and saying that we could sit together with the 3 Chinese mainland customers which we had made friends with that night and it would make us 8 pax for that table, which we thought would be reasonable enough. But no, the staffs told us that we have to open 1 bottle of liquor to be entitled to sit there, and they claimed that it's the rules to sit that table after 12am. Of course we don't think it's worth it as we have spent a lot on drinks since 10pm and so we gave up the idea.But then this is where the racist part really starts. A group of 5 Caucasians who initially sat at the small table like us, approached the staffs and requested to switch over to the sofa table, out of our surprise the staffs allowed them to sit there, and you know what, they only each had a pint of beer with them, so where is the ""purchase 1 bottle of liquor"" rules We were so mad we asked the staff again why they could sit there and we couldn't, they just simply walked off and ignored to serve us until the end. Seriously Like that's so rude and really WTF.The whole night 8 of us had been drinking 3 bottles of wine, half a dozen of shots a few glasses of cocktail which added up to over a RM1k bill, as for those guys at the big sofa table, they only had 2 to 3 pints of beers each, tops. We were very disappointed and pissed on this RACIST  RUDE manner from the staffs towards local customers.TL/DR: As long as you are White, you can enjoy the party here. As for locals, Asians and yellow skin You can come here if you want to experience how to be treated differently among other skin colours, unless you have a White dude or White chick with you, then you will be cool."

That's reality. The failure is when nightclubs start discriminating based on race. Other reviewers suggest this consistency. I got in fine 3 weeks ago for the first time... But I was with girls. My experience this time was as follows: Two of my friends already went in 2 white guys 10 minutes ago. In the long line in front of me, every single person is expediently and quickly let in. When I get to the front, unfortunately, I wasn't on the magical invitation list. I thought this was an anomaly, as I was let in the first time without a hassle, but I went again the next week and had the same experience. If anyone here is of South Asian / Middle Eastern heritage, have some more pride for yourself and go elsewhere. Even if you can get in with girls or some other way, do you really want to provide such an establishment with your patronage Same goes if you have any friends that are of a similar heritage."

The barmaid served us the drinks, but both drinks felt like only tonic with a tiny splash of Gin. I kindly asked the barmaid if she could add more Gin since it only tastes as Tonic, however the answer I received was a big NO! Following to that is; ""This is how we serve Gin  Tonic here.

We were told explicitly that there were too many of our demographic in the pub already so 3 people of our party had to go elsewhere for  30 minutes before being allowed in and that too at 6.30pm. Our demographic meaning INDIAN people with the oh so scary brown skin. So of course being respectful and may I add, it was early on in the evening and not one person of our party was wildly intoxicated or causing trouble, 3 members of our group proceeded elsewhere and came back after half an hour or so, in the meantime the rest of the group bought drinks and food and waited. Now, on coming back, the bouncer who is white and may I add a disgusting embarrassment to your pub, followed my brother to the toilet and waited for him to come out to only say that he had been watching him and that he had to leave because of his DEMOGRAPHIC, that word again. The question to you is this, is it acceptable that your bouncers think its ok to make someone feel unwanted because of the colour of their skin and say it so explicitly that that was the reason why. It makes me sick and I want to make sure that your pub is recognised for the horrible bigoted bouncer you CHOOSE to have on your door. Finally, ignoring my reviews and posts and blocking my ability to comment on your channels without an explanation goes against Facebook guidelines for pages that allow for public commenting, that which you clearly had this morning until I commented and then you swiftly deleted. The word uneducated springs to mind with both points. I want answers to all of my questions here as I would not want anyone else to be made to feel the way we were simply because of the colour of our skin."

Beware of condescending and racist staff when you go there!After the visit, my boyfriend went into the crowded gift shop while I waited inside the museum building near its cafe. Knowing that I collect postcards, he chose one for me and went to the counter to pay with his credit card. He was refused because they didnt accept card payments for 1. He came back towards me to fetch loose change and I was inside the museum caf and away from the gift shop exit, which was in the opposite direction. To my astonishment, he hadnt even made it to the caf when a giant of a white man ran from behind the counter, across the store behind my Indian boyfriend, who was half his size, yelled down at him and tore the postcard away from his hand accusing him of stealing. He tried to explain that he was fetching the change from me given that this very man had just told him that his credit card was not accepted for payment of 1. Now can anyone explain to me why someone having just paid 24 for his girlfriend and himself to spend one hour among vintage cars would steal a 1 postcard from the gift shop And while going away from the exit on top of thatMy boyfriend remained calm, took the change from me and went back to pay for the wretched postcard. But I was so upset and when we left the gift shop, he told me that he didnt even get an apology or even a halfapology from the bloke.

I have been going there for more than 7 years and have always been quiet and respect full in the cue, polite and courteous when speaking with the staff is also key even if you get refused. once in the venue they do expect respect at the bar, you have to remember they are dealing with quite a volume of impatient and rude people so be patient and say please!!!!!I have in 7 years only ever witnessed so very few minor incidents inside the venue itself simply because they pick a crowd that can for the most part deal with being in there.

I had just a single Saturday night in Berlin, having traveled half way around the world, and was looking forward to an unforgettable club experience. What I got was unforgettable, but for all the worst reasons. After standing in line in the sporadic rain for an hour, I finally was at the entrance. The doorman eyed me with ferretlike eyes and told me to wait while allowing to enter the two Germans in front of me with whom I'd been having a great conversation during the wait.  After a couple of minutes wait I was informed, with an air that denoted his clear belief that he was god here, that I would not be entering. When I gently asked why, explaining the distance I'd traveled, he simply stated that I won't. As his 3 henchmen in black moved closer, it was clear they were there to enforce the wishes of their furhrer and that compassion had no place here. For a city that publicly claims the value of diversity, I have to wonder if this was an isolated incident or if the true underbelly may be different. As I walked to the taxi stand, I became aware of and was shocked at the utter lack of ethnic or racial diversity in line clearly the message was already out.  In talking with the cabbie on the way home, I learned that nonGermans were routinely turned away and that the German youth who might not get in one night wouldn't say anything in hopes of being accepted the next time.  This persecution of those who have little voice visitors and those wanting acceptance seemed eerily close to what was occurring here 70 years ago. Rather than a line of lemurs hoping to enter, I would much prefer a procession of protestors demanding diversity and acceptance. Had I stayed quiet about this, I would be condoning this behavior as much as those who failed to oppose the last Reich. I hope that others will speak out and ensure that this unforgivable behavior and those perpetrating it will be brought to a rapid halt before it spreads further!"

We have been to various top venues for dinner and drinks over our time in New York and not once were we treated any different due to our skin colour, we were treated well considering we were from London and had the money to spend.

We had already read comments such as these before visiting the club but decided to ignore them and make our own judgements  now wish we had listened to others complete waste of time go to szimpler or instant! As soon as you get there you're made to feel very uncomfortable by security and staff behind ticket stand who when we asked a question about entrance price they turned to one another, said something In Hungarian and laughed in quite a malicious manner before answering us  there is a general uneasy and unfriendly vibe. Then after paying an entrance price you have to go upstairs and pay again to use the cloakroom. Me and my boyfriend had no problem with this but at the time did not understand if it was 100 compulsory to have to also use the cloak room to gain entry. We tried to ask the 2 ladies behind the cloakroom this who were disgustingly rude and made no attempt to understand us  just screwed there face up and kept shouting the price at us and when they finally understood what we were saying didn't say sorry just looked at each other and sighed and rolled their eyes and exchanged a few unimpressed words in Hungarian. Once inside you still feel uncomfortable by the way the bar staff speak to you and many of the locals stare at you and make you feel unwelcome for being a foreigner. It is clear that the English are not welcome in this club by both the locals and staff members despite it being marketed towards the British with flags on the walls and a hostel upstairs. The owner of this bar clearly has no business knowledge or he would not employ staff with such appalling customer service. And as for the staff themselves, fine if you don't enjoy working in a job where you have to communicate with tourists then don't go and get an office job! But don't expect to work in a bar marketed towards tourists and not expect to encounter them go and educate yourselves as by us visiting we pay your wages! Manager needs to realise that word of mouth is a very powerful thing in today's society. Honestly this bar might aswell have a sign outside saying 'no foreigners'"

It was around 1AM when we wanted to go for a jive and we didnt think that we needed to make a booking to go to a place such as Societe for a few hours.How wrong we were!! A number of small groups of ladies, including us, were at the front of the queue and were told, by a bodybuilder type bouncer, we cant go in because our names were not on the guest list and we didnt have a reservation to spend a minimum of AED1500.Other groups, who were all Western looking, after some small talk and flirting with the bouncer were let in. We questioned the bouncer and he said they had a booking although he had no paperwork or anything to go by. The second batch of Western looking girls were also let in.  I inquired again as to how can they go in and we can't as none of us have a reservation, the bouncer replied  ""I don't want to deal with you, go away"", and so we obliged.  As we walked away, another group of Western ladies who had just turned up were also let into the club.It seems that this is not the first time Societe has made people feel subjected to such racist practices. I am writing this letter to make people aware and I do not want other people to ever feel the way my friends and I felt that evening. In a country such as the UAE, a melting pot of nationalities, this should not be the case!Upon reading the reviews on their Facebook page the day after the incident, there were plenty of similar reviews on Societe, but after one of my close friends alerted the manager  owner of this club what had happened, the review page was conveniently removed..

However, they is RACIST problem there ! ! I witnessed a woman who worked their following any black customer around the store and watching what they put into their basket. It was so blatantly obvious, that is was disgusting. The sad irony he is that, I saw them later in the Mall loaded with shopping from designer stores. Anybody with those means wouldn't be working in a Spar store as this racist woman was!Anyway, I would highly recommend this scenic and interesting part of the World. It's is very small and manageable on foot, so no need for taxi's which are very, very expensive. About 12 on the meter before setting off ! ! A train in from Nice is about an hour as is CannesI would highly recommend a visit, though the summer months are intensely hot."

So I went to this club with my wife to celebrate her 30th b'day... We were with two other friends... Four of us went upto the stage as a lot of people were dancing on the stage.. But because we were Indians and not white a Bouncer came to us and asked us to get down from the stage... we came outside the stage and we asked the bouncer what did we do wrong... Yes we had a few drinks before this but I was not so drunk as to not realize what is going on... or to be violent.... in between another bouncer came to me and said I need to go outside the club ... I was completely peaceful and said that's fine let me just take my wife with me... He twisted my hand and shoved me into the ground very forcefully as if I was violent.. I asked him what did I do.. I am just asking for my wife to come with me... on this he shoved my head into the ground.... When my wife saw this commotion she dropped her purse and came to me... I lifted my hand up and said yes I am going outside just let my wife grab her purse which contained our passport... when she went to grab her purse I asked the bouncer what is his name as I wanted to file his complaint the next day... He refused to tell me his name and said he will shove me outside.. I told him he is racist and he should tell me his name... On this he again grabbed my hand and pushed me very hard into the sofa wall and twisted my arm to the point of breaking.... Till the end he didn't tell me his name... I understand people can be violent and then bouncer has to use force.. But in this instance I was completely nonviolent.. I even kept my hand up... but seeing that I am brown he just wanted to kill me.. he showed my head into the ground so harshly.. thank god I didn't hit my head against the ground else I would have been dead.. he hit me so hard that I couldn't breathe for next 5 mins... I am a student at MIT.. I am married and have two kids.. I am not someone who will cause any harm.......... But just because I was brown and I had a few drinks the bouncer treated us so badly..... I don't know what else to say... make your own judgement... I am so sad that this kind of stuff still happens in America!! .. :

FYI This is edited from what I originally submitted since we are not allowed to use profanity!This used to be a frequent spot that I used to always bring my friends visiting from out of town, and they visit a LOT! There was never a time I didn't bring a minimum of 610 people with me and I would think they would want that type of business. However, the  bouncer outside the door has claimed the last 3 times me and my friends tried to come in that they were only allowing ""regulars""...really I would think me knowing the bartenders and visiting at least 10 or more times throughout the year would make me a ""regular""!!! So I politely ask this ""person"" how does he decide who constitutes as a regular or not and he completely flipped his wig! I ask for the owner/manager and he states he will NEVER want to speak with me, that's why he's there. During the midst of all this, a couple who happen to be Caucasian comes up and he checks their ID and asks a question, she answers and says ""Well, I was here a few weeks ago""...and I guess that was good enough for him because he let her in. He then tells me you can go to the other bars besides this one! FURIOUS is and understatement as to how I am feeling right now! Not to play the race card, cuz I'm usually not that person but as I walk away I notice the place is partially empty and there are only, I do not exaggerate when I say this, ONLY Caucasian people in there. Before he turned me down, he turned down a group of about 8 young black people....but get this....the  bouncer is BLACK! Again...really!!!!! This place will never have to worry about me spending another coin in there, but best believe I am going to make a hell of a lot of noise so that the manager/owner or whoever knows this is some unacceptable bull and dare I say racist! It's a hole in the wall not the Ritz Carlton! Do yourself a favor and don't support this dump! Oh and one last thing, I asked one of my friends from out of town, who has NEVER been to this place and who is also CAUCASIAN to see if he can get in as the rest of us peeped around the corner, and he was allowed entry with no problem!

That's why we get the most powerful shots 5 for 10 or 7 with a mixed drink. We feel like more bang for our buck. However, they SERIOUSLY need a DJ or better selections via the jukebox because after awhile the honky tonk and old rock music kills your buzz. The bouncers suck and there's only one bartender that totally rocks as far as attitude, service and she's also very creative at making up shots when you're indecisive. Wish I knew her name for this review, but other than that we only come to this place when we are drinking on a budget, otherwise it totally blows. Someone mentioned they should serve food...I think that would be a terrible idea because even if they did, I wouldn't dare attempt to eat a thing at this filthy place.

They dont reserve a boat for you after all! We arrived and they said they had just given away the last boat with a steering wheel which we had reserved, so we had to wait for someone to return their boat, which caused a 45 minute delay! I think this is completely unacceptable. Also, they didnt seem to think it was a big deal at all and didnt even apologize to us. While waiting for our boat, we witnessed how the boat company got in an argument with clients that had damaged their boat. They quickly got into quite a vocal argument and the rental company started taking pictures of the renters, saying that they will post the pictures online for everyone to see etc. etc. We didn't hear what the clients were saying, though. The fight continued and the employee of the company started threatening the clients and used racist language. It was quite a show to witness...  not sure how it all ended but it definitely left such an awful impression that we certainly cannot recommend this inefficient and racist company to anyone. This company should not operate in tourism. Eventually when we got the boat, all was fine but the overall experience was negative."

But, like any nation, it has its faults and there are some areas in which the country does not have a good record. Racism is one and maintaining standards is another. Both of these issues are in evidence at Zoo Negara.The race card is played at the ticket counter, where I was charged a 30 premium on my entry price because I was not Malaysian and then obliged to walk around the zoo with a label that read 'Foreigner.' I understand the nationalistic pride that wishes to put Malaysians first  all countries do this in one way or another. But charging different prices to visitors to the country and then labelling them as aliens does not send out a good message. And, as someone who feels Malaysian and who loves the country as I do, I was offended and embarrassed by these quite unnecessary actions.The zoo itself is a mixture of healthylooking animals in wellpresented, roomy enclosures and others which are distressingly caged with inadequate room and inappropriate meeting of their needs. I visited Zoo Negara many years ago and it was one of the first to use paddock enclosures to display its animals rather than cages. It was an excellent start which held much promise. But, as so often happens in Malaysia, this was not built on and the zoo is probably worse now than it was 30 years ago. On the plus side, there is an excellent paddock presenting African animals such as giraffe, zebra and ostrich together in a single enclosure with a watchtower for better viewing. I found this innovative and thoughtful. And the new panda house is also an excellent presentation. On the down side, the Asian shortclawed otters, beautiful, playful creatures that are a delight to watch swimming and playing together, were in a cage with a tiny pool of still water which was clearly not big enough to swim in and looked frankly stagnant. Needless to say, the little animals were not in the water, but were literally climbing the walls at the back of their cage. Finally, for all its size, there are not actually many animals here and a significant number of those that are there are doubled or even tripled up in enclosures around the zoo. So there are three tapir enclosures, for example. Lovely to see these animals, but there are so many different uses to which these enclosures could be put to display a wider variety. There are almost no monkeys, this is a country where such creatures are plentiful, but often go unseen. And those that are there are in small cages with thick meshing which makes them difficult to see. Even the ape enclosures, which are nice enough, contained only one chimpanzee and one orang utan, which was a shame.So, all in all, having been offended and humiliated upon entry, I enjoyed some beautiful tigers, wellpresented pandas and African plain animals and had a pleasant stroll through some welllandscaped scenery. But I was ultimately disappointed by the lack of variety, the repetition of some animals and the poor care that others were receiving. As is so often the case in Malaysia, here lies true potential for a world class attraction which fails to deliver because they are unable to sustain a good start and build on it. And I was obliged to pay a 30 premium for the privilege. It would be very easy to put these issues right, but I fear there is not the will to do so."

Some enclosures were completely empty, and the animals that were there looked depressed and their enclosures were often lacking in terms of cleanliness and space. The bird aviary was absolutely pathetic  it was designed as a walkin aviary where you can walk among the birds themselves, but there were only two birds in there, a pigeon which clearly looked lost, and some fat blue bird there were no placards anywhere so we didn't know what we were looking at that was flying back and forth in a pathetic attempt to escape. The walkways are poorly designed, so you're often doubling back to see animals which sometimes aren't there!, and there is very little shade/shelter to be found, which is a serious problem in Malaysian heat. Also, the entire zoo appears to be in construction right now, so visitors to the zoo have to weave between piles of rubble and even a forklift at one point !. What was most shocking was the total lack of respect for some of the animals, which were having to live in cramped enclosures and right next to loud construction. Also seriously shocked by the price! My friend and I are expats living in Malaysia, so when the ticket seller saw our white skins, she instantly tried to charge us RM165, which is extremely extortionate for a Malaysian park, especially of this quality. As soon as we pulled out our MyKads, the price dropped by half, which feels both racist and just generally unfair!The best part of this zoo was definitely the panda enclosure, where some money has clearly gone into making a large, airy space where it is very easy to get a good view of the pandas. If you're into pandas, come for them, especially while the cub is still small and cute, but otherwise don't waste your time. If you're a tourist in Malaysia looking for a nice wildlife park, I would recommend the bird park instead."

You get an hour at the visitor decks and then are transported to a different part of the glacier, by bus and then boat, to do the trekking. The guides were friendly, funny, very nice. The tours are in English and Spanish  our guide spoke perfectly fluent English. The trek was informative. There was whiskey at the end of the trek and water for nondrinkers that I sort of wish wasn't a thing because, as a nondrinker, I don't like subsidizing other people's alcohol costs. Overall, if you have done the Franz Josef glacier trek in New Zealand, I think that one is run better from booking through hiking, but this was still good and I'm still happy we did it. Wear waterproof clothing and hiking boots if you have them; sneakers may be a bit chilly and wet but should be fine too.When you are booking, you have to email. You do not get to choose a time of day; they basically start filling in each day at 8am so if you are the first to email you are at 8am and if you are later to email you get 11am. We were on the 11am and did not feel any disadvantage. In fact, this gave us time to prepare lunch before leaving the hotel.One star off for the pick up drama. Our friends were staying at a different hotel than us. We got on the little bus and did not see them. After getting to the big bus, we still did not see them. The bus was parked so I got off the bus to ask the driver if they knew to pick up our friends and before I could even finish my sentence, he started yelling at me in rapid Spanish to get back on the bus and continued yelling through my attempts to speak until I turned around and got back on the bus. In another 10 minutes, our friends arrived in a separate small bus. They explained to me, as they speak Spanish, that they had asked if we had gotten picked up as well, and the reply had been, ""the Oriental one"" Hey Hielo y Avenutra... for a customeroriented company, you may want to teach your employees to 1 not yell at customers asking legitimate questions and 2 not refer to them by outdated, racist terms."

However, what happened after the minitrek really upset my significant other and me, and I was annoyed that it put a bad taste in our mouths after an otherwise enjoyable trip. An older tour guide with Hielo y Adventura, who was leading a group before us, was incredibly racist to us and some other Asian people on our tour. After the tour, were waiting for the ferry to take us back to the buses. We were standing in line when the ferry for his group arrived. Instead of telling us nicely that we should wait for the next ferry, he yelled at us and began talking to us for about a minute in gibberish meant to sound like Chinese or Japanese, in front of the other tourists. His attempt to put on a show at the cost of our comfort was severely racist and misguided. That a grown man can behave this way to his own customers is incredibly mindboggling, and sadly, reveals an utter lack of respect for people who happen to look Asian I am Chinese American. I really hope he manages to get himself some racial sensitivity training and stop behaving this way to his patrons. Here is a photo of the racist guide. Hielo y Adventura, if you are reading this review, I sincerely hope you will accost him about his behavior, and ask him to improve."

The staff was still ok.Then on the tour day, itself everything went smoothly with all the staffs were polite and friendly to you. Then until we were introduced to our English speaking guide, there where the whole experience became really sucks. He has no smile and look very serious n stern. Going to the glacier itself, he walked off and chitchatting with 2 tourists in front and left the rest of us behind. When we unknowingly strayed to some parts to take pics nearer to the glacier, he called us back without any smile almost angrylooking.... I mean ""hello....first of all u didnt tell us if that was off limits...n secondly u could at least tell us nicely to come back but not like a school teacher scolding a student. I find him to be racist as when he was putting on crampons for others he seems friendly but when it came to my turn he just look serious n just chitchat in spanish with other guide n when the size doesn't fit my shoe, he just look at my foot and said ""Get off"" ....i dont realise he was talking to me n get off what I only realise he was refering to my leg after he look at me and said ""Get off"" again but at a higher tone. God, i was really taken off by suprise as i never was being treated like that before.... These were some of the rude things i encountered, and there were more i swear n all the way i just cannot wait for the whole things to be over as  my safety seems to be at their hand. However luckily for me, the other guide is nice and helpful, cheering me up all the way.  After the whole thing finished, we were brought to the viewing area where we only have about 1 hr to view the glacier, and i rather just sit and get fascinated by the glacier for hours, watching n listening crevices fall and save my cash rather than spending it on the overpriced tour with the rudest guide ever. This rude guy seems to be forced to work the same things over n over again for 12 long years which might explains his bitter attitude that he brought from his bitter life.All i can say to Hielo Aventura that, if nothing done here, one really bad egg can spoilt the rest of the teams effort in trying to make a good image for Hielo Aventura...So to all of you who thinking of going for their tour, u can risk spoiling your dream holiday of patagonia with the rude bad egg, or you can opt out the tour which is all about trekking on the glacier which you can do in el chaten instead as advice from the others. Yes, please still visit beautiful perito morino n get fascinated by it merely just by watching from the view area fors hrs. The bus ride is only 80pesos if im not wrong. I really shld have done the bus ride only. Nothing much for the trekking experience really...."

Thinking positive, we went to a park in Napa and played frisbee for the rest of the day and we had a lot of fun there but the lake experience was super stressful. They basically do not care about customers and their time, the rental guy Marty or Martin was pretty rude and very condescending. He has wasted our time, and the time is priceless, once you've lost it you can never get it back we're all working professionals and were there to have a day off work having fun on labor day.

Reading the comments by Marilyn M I am shocked at the way she has reacted to having her bag searched as this is standard practice and just the staff doing their job properly, I certainly don't think it was anything to do with race!The fact that the owner tracked her down in another bar is frankly amazing customer service and speaks volumes about the bars ethos. I am sure the door staff were mortified to be accused of racial profiling which is not an accusation that should be used so flippantly.Apologies for the rant but this really is a great bar with amazing staff my friends and I love it and wouldn't change a thing....keep up the amazing work Ballroom!"

The staff at the door let my friend through with her big bag she was white, but subsequently proceeded to search two of my bags. As an afterthought to not make it look too obvious, the same member of staff searched her bag, after suddenly noticing it. After feeling slightly uneasy about this, I then questioned the bouncerwho advised that their policy is to search every other bag which was inconsistent as why had he searched my friends bag as he had already searched mine. In addition, me and my friend whom I was with, were tailing behind four of our other friends and none of their bags were searched, therefore making their search every other bag policy a load of old tosh. We were meant to be going to The Bramley but accidentally went into the queue of The ballroom as they are so close together so I cant comment on the bar itself, only the inconsistent door policy. When the  owner of the Ballroom found me in the Bramley, and offered me an apology about how, the bouncer was feeling really bad about the whole thing, and how he isnt at all racist and then proceeded to guilt trip me I felt he was trying to make me feel bad for making a fuss, and had absolutely no consideration of how this had affected my night in any way, shape or form whatsoever. All the protestations with words about how not racist the bar or any of the staff were, and how bad the bouncer felt , and how he was questioning himselfmaybe he should without taking any consideration of how this unpleasant incident had affected my evening.  As we all know, people can claim to not be racist with their words, but at the end of the day its actions that matter. I felt this whole thing had been handled really badly and the owners response was really telling I told him despite anything he said, this incident was going to be on tripadvisor he then said thanks in a petulant way, then walked off. This suggests the reputation of the place is more important to him then overall customer experience."

The self guided tour was informative and we also signed up for the beer tasting. The beer tasting at 4pm by our Irish guide really saves the day for us after an upsetting experience at Carlsberg Museum.The upset happened on 16 February at 350pm at the souvenir shop when we were trying to redeem for our free beer and gift. Noted that the counter was understaffed and a chaotic queue had formed up. We were second in line, but suddenly another queue formed up and the staff at the counter just ignored us. We were actually standing in front of her and she treated us as invisible and start serving group from another queue. We waited for her to finish serving the other group and thought it will be our turn but again, she ignore and move on to other groups. At that point in time, we feel like we were racially discriminated as Asians but hopefully that is not her intent. Lucky thing is that we are not keen on the free gift or drink as we will be going for the beer tasting.It was unfortunate that Carlsberg who has a campus as well as related infrastructure in the area, deserved such negative publicity.

To make things worse, our dropoff was the first one and when my husband and I stepped off the bus without thanking them, Jeremy yelled out to us youre welcome for not leaving you back there. We will not be recommending this or any other Jucy tours to anyone we know."

The trip was amazing and we had a nice experience enjoying the stunning views and the hospitality of the crew members.But there was one crew member who showed racist behaviour. There was a girl and a boy welcoming the people when entering the ship. The girl was good and the boy was acting as a racist. He greeted everyone at the ship except the Sub continent people. He turned his head away when we were entering and his face was very rude. Same thing he did for other passengers like us. The same thing happened when we exiting the cruise after finished. Also during the journey when I asked about the toilet he has responded with a disgusting attitude. This behaviour of him has ruined our mind and made the whole journey unpleasant.I would suggest the management to take necessary actions regarding this issue if not other passengers also would face similar issues in future.

The scenery was phenomenal glaciers, forests and rivers not to mention the sound which is actually a Fiord.But the day was given a big downer as our bus driver was rude, condescending, passive aggressive and especially racist to the Chinese tourists on board. It made the 10hour bus trip extremely unpleasant. His name was Jeremy so if you book a tour with Jucy, which I still recommend as a company, and hear that name ask for your money back and book another date.the other Jucy staff were gorgeous and accommodating the food was good and the boat and bus were very clean. we even were lucky enough to see fur seals and dolphins. the cruise captain drove the nose of the boat under a 140m tall waterfall so that those who wanted to could experience the enormous force of this natural beauty. GO JUCY just not with JEREMY"

Before deciding if you want to do this tour, know that you will be spending about 89 hrs on an uncomfortable bus with very short pit stops. I would not recommend doing this tour especially on a day with bad weather as you will be very disappointed when you get to Milford sound. On Jan 4th, We were picked up in a BUS that did not resemble the vehicle that was shown on the website. Instead it was a leased bus from another company that was uncomfortable, old you could feel every bump in the road and did not offer wifi. To add insult to injury, the bus we were on was 95 Asians and Indians while the newer and better bus had 95 Caucasians. It was obvious to everyone on our bus that there was racial discrimination going on.If I had to do this all over, I would have driven myself."

While queuing one of us put our empty drink down but the bouncer, having seen us told us to pick it up and put it in the bin, which we did without hesitation and no fuss at all. When finally arriving at the door, they asked us where we were from in an aggressive tone, and being half French myself I tried to reason with them in French saying that I didnt see what difference that would make. As soon as I said we were British they cut us off and refused to let us in, accusing us of being disrespectful to our own country. I was confused, apologised for disrespecting them and asked for a more reasonable explanation. The bouncers made a huge scene and not only embarrassed us but disrespected our entire country. Perhaps they did have a good reason for turning us down but the way they handled it, humiliated us and refused to give us any reasonable explanation apart from the fact that we were British, is, to me, unacceptable and shouldn't be put up with considering how expensive it is.  On our way home, we bumped into other friends who were also turned down on the basis of looking like Algerian c I've been here before and it is a fantastic club but if this is how the staff treat their customers they either need to be fired or reportedeither way Gotha need to sort themselves out."

I showed him my plane tickets that also proved that I was 20 years old, but he accused me of giving him a forged ticket. He let every other person enter the club with an ID and not their passport whilst looking me in the eye as he asked for their IDs and NOT their passports. He even let my other two white friends both Americans into the club with just their ID without asking for their passport. I have experienced racism before in America, but never the denial of entry into a club based on my race. This white security guard made a very bad impression of Bangkok on me for the night.

But I left a bit early because of the deeply offensive and racist diatribe by the guide. Imagine if you toured a church in the US and the guide went off for a long time about how wonderful Trump is, how Mexicans contribute nothing to countries and they shouldnt be here, etc. That just gives a broad idea of the deeply offensive and factually incorrect lecture we all had to hear from the guide. A shame, because it totally marred what otherwise would have been a highlight of my trip. Now Im just nauseous."

I also saw Carrot Top and Vinnie Favarito while on this trip.  George's show is not even 25 as entertaining as those guys.  He spends much of the show sitting on a rolling office chair, which makes him seem old and lazy.  The showroom was only about 33 full, and it was easy to see why.  I was sitting in the front row, and forced myself to keep a smile on my face because we kept making eye contact.  He seemed to be mumbling into the mic for much of the show.  There also seemed to be some ""reverse"" discrimination when he was giving out prizes at the end of the show.  I was going to keep that to myself, but it was so obvious.  I thought is was just me, but then I herd other people talking about it, so many people felt the same way. I am not suing the man is a racist, I am only commenting on my perception.

The two unwelcoming bouncers mumbled a bonjour and let us in ""free of charge"" after searching our bags. A staff guy took us to a bed and handed us a drinks menu. Since we had already eaten elsewhere we were fine with just a cocktail, a water and a beer for the few hours we were there. We spent our time swimming,playing cards and lounging which was fine but the problems started on our exit. My bf was handed a bill for the overpriced drinks with an ADDITIONAL 600 dhms which they said was for bed hire. We were not told this on entry nor did the waiter explain there was a charge. All he asked us was whether we wanted to open a tab for the drinks ALONE!Of course we calmly and respectfully disputed the matter and as the waiter was not really letting us get a word in edgeways he called over his manager who was even more rude, insulting and racially profiling. My bf and I are both people of colour in our mid 20s.The manager was quite obviously intimidated by my boyfriend's physique commenting 'you think it's because you are big you don't have to pay You will not leave if you don't pay'...This completely threw us off but let me know he was clearly insecure, has a poor level of customer service, and trained his staff to follow his poor example...He even had the audacity to suggest we call the British embassy to rescue us if we were broke or we could not leave. They did not care that it was my birthday or our first visit to Morocco or that we had a flight booked in 6 hours time. For us, it was the principle more than the cost. Our waiter insisted that he had told us upon arrival that the tab would include the cost for the bed WHICH WAS A LIE!  At this point we were surrounded by a dozen members of staff and their cocky boss who stated we would have been told about the bed fee at the door. We weren't and to top it off when we went over the doorman the idiot shamelessly LIED and said he clearly told us about the price of the bed. It seems like a scam they are running not a business. They talk down to young people of a certain profile.I can assure every reader of this review, that there was no misunderstanding as I am fluent in French.  In the end we were forced to pay the bill and were escorted out like street cats in the Medina and it didn't stop there.....we were further conned by their taxi drivers outside the venue!!!WE WILL NEVER EVER VISIT ANY NIKKI BEACH BASED ON THIS SHOCKING EXPERIENCE.....I WOULD ADVISE THAT NOBODY ELSE DOES EITHER. Terrible thieving racists with massive egos and zero communications skills. Reading the other reviews, it seems like this is a recurring thing and it looks like they are already losing customers as the place was pretty much empty for a 37 degree Saturday!"

I then rang the number for the manager listed earlier, and we realised he was the same person who was refusing us. I kept ringing the number and in front of our faces he kept declining the call.

Lady said my money will be refunded 24 business days and that was false they still charged my card and they didnt refund me my money. Bunch of phonies all the wanted was our money! Never again! Dont go because your trip maybe be canceled too "

I knew what I was in there for,  Balvenie, carribean cask whiskey and I was after something new to try. Once we had started a conversation, the lady owner jumped straight into action with a wealth of knowledge and sound advice, even gave me tastes of a couple of whiskies that  from the information I gave her  she thought I'd enjoy, she had sold out of the large bottles, so it was JUST to offer me a heads up for when I'm back home and shopping at my usual outlets.. I can see why people would jump to a negative review, but I can't even start to imagine how frustrating the constant stream of tourists drifting in poking at her wares, i could hear a couple complaining about how many bottles of Bells they could get for the cost of an 18yr Highland park. I was in there for 30 mins, imagine that every single day.............. As for racist, there was a couple in there also of African appearance and they left happy from what I seen. I think the previous ""racist"" remark was scathing and intolerant. My personal experience of the shop owner was frosty at first but once I got over that she was delightful and extremely helpful.As for the shop: it's well stocked with great whiskey to suit any budget, but if you're not looking for something a bit ""special"" then just go to the coop and don't waste her time.  Ps. the shop Sells other stuff too !!! I went in for whiskey "

Either way, why would she ask the white man behind me the question instead of asking me who was ahead I also asked her what her question was based on, and her answer was 'experience'!!!I'm anIndian brown woman and I had entered the store alone. It was interesting that she singled out the only brown female in the store to pick on, for no reason at all. She was rude, pompous and arrogant!

The two unwelcoming bouncers mumbled a bonjour and let us in ""free of charge"" after searching our bags. A staff guy took us to a bed and handed us a drinks menu. Since we had already eaten elsewhere we were fine with just a cocktail, a water and a beer for the few hours we were there. We spent our time swimming,playing cards and lounging which was fine but the problems started on our exit. My bf was handed a bill for the overpriced drinks with an ADDITIONAL 600 dhms which they said was for bed hire. We were not told this on entry nor did the waiter explain there was a charge. All he asked us was whether we wanted to open a tab for the drinks ALONE!Of course we calmly and respectfully disputed the matter and as the waiter was not really letting us get a word in edgeways he called over his manager who was even more rude, insulting and racially profiling. My bf and I are both people of colour in our mid 20s.The manager was quite obviously intimidated by my boyfriend's physique commenting 'you think it's because you are big you don't have to pay You will not leave if you don't pay'...This completely threw us off but let me know he was clearly insecure, has a poor level of customer service, and trained his staff to follow his poor example...He even had the audacity to suggest we call the British embassy to rescue us if we were broke or we could not leave. They did not care that it was my birthday or our first visit to Morocco or that we had a flight booked in 6 hours time. For us, it was the principle more than the cost. Our waiter insisted that he had told us upon arrival that the tab would include the cost for the bed WHICH WAS A LIE!  At this point we were surrounded by a dozen members of staff and their cocky boss who stated we would have been told about the bed fee at the door. We weren't and to top it off when we went over the doorman the idiot shamelessly LIED and said he clearly told us about the price of the bed. It seems like a scam they are running not a business. They talk down to young people of a certain profile.I can assure every reader of this review, that there was no misunderstanding as I am fluent in French.  In the end we were forced to pay the bill and were escorted out like street cats in the Medina and it didn't stop there.....we were further conned by their taxi drivers outside the venue!!!WE WILL NEVER EVER VISIT ANY NIKKI BEACH BASED ON THIS SHOCKING EXPERIENCE.....I WOULD ADVISE THAT NOBODY ELSE DOES EITHER. Terrible thieving racists with massive egos and zero communications skills. Reading the other reviews, it seems like this is a recurring thing and it looks like they are already losing customers as the place was pretty much empty for a 37 degree Saturday!"

I then rang the number for the manager listed earlier, and we realised he was the same person who was refusing us. I kept ringing the number and in front of our faces he kept declining the call.

There are no signs anywhere or info on the web saying foreigners are excluded. She then did the same to another couple of young Japanese tourists and basically pushed them out of the building. I waited until they went in and then asked the security guard if we could visit. He was also quite rude  this is a parliament, why would it be open to the public.

The atmosphere was really good: with the mixture of Ecuadorian and foreigners, one could dance to your typical American party songs, and latino music which spiked the night. However, the treatment by the security was outrageously, if not racist, poor, and my American friends were witnesses of such events. I am American as well, but my family is Ecuadorian and indigenous. An event I could share to back this statement was when my friend left to go outside the club to catch a taxi back to our hostel. One of the security guards thought it was appropriate to ""grab"" my attention by pulling my long hair really hard just to say that my American friend was having troubles communicating with one of the taxi drivers outside on where he wanted to go.

I mean, c'mon, do you guys seriously do that I don't think that was very courteous at all, and I received no apology whatsoever for this action.

There my friends who belongs to Netherlands, Belgium and Ukraine were allowed entry but I wasn't under the flimsy pretext that I was a foreigner. We tried to reason with the bigoted bouncer that 3/4th of the people in the company are foreigner but according to him, I am a ""different"" kind of foreigner. Well since nothing was left unspoken in the brief altercation between me and the biased guard before my friends got involved we decided that perhaps sharing this experience with other fellow travellers would be a good idea. Clubbing culture in Vinnytsia as we found out can be termed as rudimentary at its very best with racism served as a side dish : So in case you happen to denounce racism in your everyday life, probably denouncing and boycotting this club would be a good idea to share your solidarity with the other so called ""different"" foreigner who probably faces their share of discrimination everyday at this destination. I don't even live in Vinnytsia, so I can't even imagine what my other fellow ""different"" foreigners might feel living there on a daily basis ! My heart goes out to them.

The door staff were very RUDE and scrutinized us from a distance and said we could not go in as it was full. If we insisted on going in we needed to pay 5000dhs just to discourage us. I tried to explain that I called earlier, and was told its 3000dhs, they seemed uninterested with what I was saying. I called their call center again and low and behold the lady still said it was 3k for a table and not 5k. In short, I found it very racist and cheap for a well known brand like Armani to be associated to such illiterate staff. They need to wake up. I was disappointed!"

She was telling everyone that Chinese people all have slender eyes. What a racist remark! She was gesturing the eyes, and she said ""we don't care if you're Korean or Japanese, we call you Chinese, because your eyes are like that"".I can't believe she works in the tourism industry! She calls herself as a tour guide Save your racist remarkst to yourself,  NOT to travelers from around the world! Havana Colonial was the tour we booked with a Sunwing reprepsentative at our hotel. It was pretty bad. Save your money for a selfguided tour where you actually stop at places. First half of the day was spent on the road and picking up everyone from their hotels, which took 2.5 hours. Then we arrived at a dingy looking restaurant in Havana for some uncooked chicken and rice. The restaurant was dirty and old looking. The rest of the day we rushed from place to place and only stopped at Old Havana for a 45 mins free time and some walking tour. We really didn't get to stop or see much. The tour guide made the whole trip worse. Delia or so I think her real name is talked nonstop for 2.5 hours since our pick up. She kinda had an attitude, and shared her pet peeves of what tourists complain the most. I disagreed with a lot of things she said, and didn't give a chance to respond. We got so sick of hearing her talk about politics and feminism, while all we needed to hear was the tour sites and a bit of their history. I felt trapped in the tour. She finally stopped talking on our way back. She was also very rude, and argued with us for some minor things. Didn't have respect or sensitivity for seniors or had an understanding of traveling with seniors. By the end she said that she deserved tips, and had to be more than 1 CUC  basically outwardly asking for tips. That kind of made it awkward for us. Sugar, Rum, and Cigar tour was alright. The tour guide was friendly and very laidback, and very helpful. His name is Alexander. The tour itself was kind of dry, where you visit the countryside and watch someone cut a sugar cane, then ride a steam train in the middle of nowhere, with nothing to see, except some shoeless children chasing the train for money. It was hard to watch. I think they try very hard to share what they have to offer though, so it's a real Cuban experience nonetheless."

I have travelled all over Europe, North America, and South America, and have spent many years living abroad as both a teen and an adult, and I have never been to a place that was as bad as Stellenbosch. There was a squatter camp a few hundred yards from my ""upscale"" apartment. It seems like almost everyone in South Africa has a propensity to be dishonest and exaggerate how ""great"" South Africa is, and how their facilities are up to western standards. They aren't. The above I could have handled if the racism wasn't thrown in the mix. I wouldn't recommend going there for travel or studying. I have a 3.6 GPA in the sciences from a top rated university outside of South Africa and deciding to study abroad in SA was one of the worst mistakes of my life. They think all black people are stupid and they will treat you that way. The professors I worked with were racist and incompetent. One of them even went out of his way to try to destroy my reputation with my references after I started standing up for myself. Insults were the norm. Stay far far away from Stellenbosch if you're planning to study abroad and if you want a quality education! There are plenty of other schools that are much higher ranked  and more importantly  recognized internationally. Don't study at Stellenbosch!"

But at the main entrance to the mall, a security guard refused us admission and said we would have to walk all the way around to the other side of the mall where there was an entrance that led directly into the restaurant. So the three of us, including my firend's 93 year old father who walks with a cane, did that. Once we were seated inside the restaurant though we saw lots of people entering it from inside the mall. And when we were leaving, our server told us we could walk through the mall to the exit facing the hotels where the security guard had prevented us from entering. It took us a while but we eventually figured out what had happened. The guard had looked at us wearing shorts nice shorts and it is a tropical climate after all! and at our skin colour two of the three of us are brown and decided we were too poor and too dark to be allowed in. It was quite shocking to realize that we had been profiled in this way  shocking too because we have visited the mall many times before without incident. My assumption is that the mall management trains the guards to do exactly this sort of  screening. It's a moment like this that makes explicit the racism and ugly class divides within Brazilian society. It would be nice if the mall management would disavow this sort of profiling, but I'm not holding my breath."

So you have to find and enter the unmarked building to find the very helpful information people.  It was 50 degrees, so they weren't hiding from the cold.There is no complimentary place to check in your skis or snowboard, but you can leave equipment at the place where you can rent a big basket to store things.  It is fairly quick to get your basket or equipment at the basket desk, which are both inexpensive.  You should check in your skis or snowboard at the basket desk as they imply it's not safe to lay your equipment around.  You should get a big basket for your things, as there are only tiny lockers in the tiny locker/changing area.The snack machines were 95 empty, which sucked, because there were limited food options.  When we arrived, the only restaurant we found didn't open until noon or something like that.  And a better food option restaurant we planned to eat in after skiing was closed at or before 5pm.  Food options very limited.  I was interested in buying some googles, but before i found the shop, I was told it wasn't worth finding and or didn't really exist.The slopes are great for beginners and intermediate, as even the blacks diamond and double diamond were all really blues.  The snow bases at bottom and top of mountain seem to be less than half of what they claimed.I kept running into abnormally rude employees not guests, and initially thought I was just running into people having a bad day.  After seeing those people interact with white people in the same situations, I eventually figured out I was actually running into kinda aggressive racist employees all day.

The owner is only interested in your money and he's a big racist. First he tried to convince us to take a scooter for each person instead of 2 per 1 scooter, then tried to scam us with the prices and finally when we refused all his scams and he found out we are from Romania he cursed us. I couldn't belive it... this never happened to us and we traveled a lot through Italy. Also, after I saw how crazy the traffic in Italy is, we felt relieved. Capri is best done by foot because of it's narrow streets were scooters aren't allowed so they are useless. You better take the funicular and then walk by foot, its a lot cheaper and safer."

On another note when clubs are often racist and bewary if they stop you mostly for crowd quality control most targeted are blacks its shocking but true.Theres a good bunce of Bars here too to choose from but like the clubs most of the restaurants and bars are Chinesy regardless of what the name of the place is."

Near the end of the evening, around 10pm I'd say, 2 staff members from Bartini were cleaning up in front of their own bar and were complaining that people had left glasses on top of their green wheely bin hint: don't leave it in the middle of the street then. As I went to put my glass on top of the bin, the young Malay guy told me in a not particularly friendly tone to take the glass and put it inside the other bar because it's from them, to which I replied ""that's not my job, I'm a customer"". The guy then snatched the glass from me and threw it into the bin, then turned around and said ""this isn't your country either, it's my country"". This threw me off for a minute as I was frankly flabbergasted that someone would say this, especially in a place like club street that relies on foreigners for it's business.I wasn't going to let it rest their so I asked the guy numerous times, are you a racist, do you hate foreigners, to which he admitted that yes, he does hate foreigners. He said those words. After this, I told him he was stupid and where did he think his bar would be if there were no foreigners around There was no coherent reply to this and the female Malay staff member then decided she would also get involved making insults and telling me I was stupid and crazy. They then made a tactical retreat inside the bar and we didn't see them again for the rest of the evening before we left, I think the manager possibly spotted what was going on and told them to go inside but I can't say with any certainty.So that's it, I've never drunk in this bar and I certainly never will now. It's up to you to decide if you want to give your business to a place that insults potential customers and is racist to boot. I'd love to see the management of the place come on here to try and defend the indefensible, but I won't hold by breath."

I have never myself seen racism happen at Tom's but then again I've not looked for it either. If it does happen then of course it is not okay. When it comes to discrimination based on physical appearance shape, clothes, weight, look, etc. this is not special for Tom's. Such discrimination is practiced at the entrance of every night club in the world! Tom's is a popular bar, and when more people show up at the door the bouncers have to be more selective. Being refused at the door is a kick in the teeth but that's just how the game works."

We decided to visit Gullivers to enjoy some cocktails and to play some pool. When we arrived in the pool area it was empty apart from two groups of men playing. The area was maintained by some female staff who monitored the pool tables. It was clear that they were irritated by the presence of a group of females playing pool.They were very pushy when we were ordering cocktails, took their time bringing our change and were also pushy when waiting for us to pay them for the pool table. We had about 4 games between us when we before told that we had to finish up because other people wanted to play. Meanwhile around us the group of men who were there before us continued playing undisturbed. Whilst we were playing we felt rushed to finish, the staff started clearing our table making it very clear they wanted us to hurry up and move. After my friend potted the black ball we decided we would quickly pot the few remaining balls. However the woman monitoring the pool tables came over and kicked us off. Meanwhile the groups of men around us carried on playing undisturbed. It seems that this is a bar which is heavily targeted at men. There are lots of beer, pool tables and women looking to pick up a male customer. Male customers are left undisturbed where as women are pushed about to make room for them.We were hoping to spend the night drinking cocktails and playing pool but instead we found ourselves in a place that was unwelcoming, rude and sexist. I note from other reviews that the place has also been accused of being racist. A prejudiced pub is not attractive, sort it out. I'm certainly not coming back."

We have a cabin in Big Bear, and when I am up there with guests I always include this tour on the itinerary. I have always found the captain to be extremely gracious and courteous. I am of an ethnicity that could be mistaken as Indian or Latina and I have never ever sensed any kind of racism from the captain.Please read that review with a grain of salt."

I, as a white man in his 60s, could not believe how he treated some of his passengers, particularly nonwhite/minority ones.  He abruptly chastised in a rude and browbeating manner several wellmannered East Indian adults in their 40s/60s talking amongst themselves in their native language, telling them twice in a threatening manner as though they were children to be quiet. Those passengers surprisingly responded graciously.  They were apparently talking too loud for Bellows' liking even though he was at the helm 10 feet away with his microphone, but had no problem with white passengers sitting farther away and talking amongst themselves at the same volume level given the ambient noise.  In embarrassment, several of the above noted persons later moved farther away from Bellows; the apparent family patriarch moved to the bow of the boat.Likewise, Bellows later chastised another minority woman in her 50s, quietly standing for 30 seconds on the bridge taking photos, 5 or 6 feet from where Bellows was originally standing, before he approached and ordered her to stop taking photos, and then abruptly grabbed her cellphone from her hands.  He gave it back after the protests of several other passengers who did not know each other.The Big Bear Lake Marina owner Steve indicated they are not affiliated with the Queen tour other than ticketing, but apologized for Bellows' behavior and offered discounts to those involved for any of the Marinaowned watercrafts.   I don't know if Chris Bellows is RACIST or just has ANGER MANAGEMENT issues, but a caveat to anyone who takes a ride on his boat, particularly if you are nonwhite.  I would certainly recommend choosing another boat tour as there are several others at different marinas on the lake."

A group of friends and I stopped by this past Friday for drinks and were kicked out 30 minutes later due to what they called a ""mistake"" but we know to be straight up racism. My entire group was forced out of the bar with no explanation or courtesy, we barely had time to grab our coats. Once outside we demanded an answer from the bouncer and were told that we had a large tab that was paid without a tip. Now there were over ten of us and we had all ordered at least 20 drinks between us and some food, not one of us had run up a tab as large as they claimed 100 and none of us neglected to leave a tip on our purchases. After many minutes of conversation, the bouncer finally told us that they had made a mistake and offered to let us back in. Apparently, it was some other group that had left the poor tip. My group refused to return and while we stood outside on the curb, we did not witness any other individual or group of patrons removed from the bar. The ""mistake"" explanation was thrown at us once we started accusing them of racism given that our group was mainly minority women that didn't fit in with the largely white crowd that night. If they truly did catch their mistake then another group should have been removed from the bar but that was not the case which goes to show that their explanation was really just a lie. One of my friends had not been given a chance to even close her tab so we headed back in to do so. We asked the bartender about what had happened with our group and all she did was laugh and shake her head at us. No apologies were offered, not from the bartender nor the bouncers at the door. This was my first and last time at this bar. Horrible service, terrible music that was played way too loud and bad drink choices. We went to Bond Street Social afterward and the crowd was so much better. Save yourself the trouble and skip this racist bar."

Me and my friend had no trouble getting in but when it came to my two other male friends who were Spanish and Asian, they where turned down. We spend 10/15 minutes trying to get them in but no luck. The worst thing was that another group of African guys turned up and was let me in straight away. We all got the impression that these bouncers were racist and very ignorant. We ended up having to leave our friends in the end and headed downstairs. It is basically a basement with no windows which holds in the smell of body odor and sick. I head to the dance floor and some girl was dancing with just her bra on and shorts. The bra was too small so she was revealing everything, was not impressed. The songs that were played were good but chanced every minute and didn't mix well, i suggest they change the DJ.

The man that worked in there called me the B word again and again in front of my child who is only 10. He said you are Chinese, cussed some more and added blah blah blah in an insulting way. It all started because my mom didn't speak English. There was also a middle aged couple inside from Argentina that felt so bad that they had to tell the man working in the kissing fish to shut up and give some respect to women. They ended up leaving in the middle of their service with us. The other two women that worked in there just watched this sick show. It seemed like it was a completely normal way to treat customers. Rudeness and racism toward us was completely acceptable there. We hadn't even started the service yet, and asked for refund. They claimed they refunded the charge but that was a lie. In the end I had to dispute it as fraud. RACIST, SEXIST! NOT OK! AVOID! Athens has plenty of places like this, but with much better manners."

The best option in my opinion is a three hours flight to Dubai or 2 hour flight Sharm ElSheikh.Small advise: Do it whenever you could get a long weekend.My fellows who can't access to this resort, I wish to you a great holidays in other places."

The beach is clean and large.  Lawn chairs and shade umbrellas are provided.  This facility is VERY racist.  They prefer to only allow white expats.  Women who are covered or men wearing traditional dress will not be given entry nor people with darker skin.  Also price is always a surpriseeach week the fees vary depending upon who is working the gate.  In August 2014 I paid 150SAR per adult and 50 SAR per child.  There are many other beaches that are a lot less expensive.

My South African and American friend and I took a cab to the beach, which is a 45 minute drive from town. After showing our ID Igama or Passport  we were allowed entry to the beach. Shortly afterwards our other work colleagues arrived and were refused entry. The reason given was that they were not members. Our other work colleagues are of Phillipino nationality. We are all healthcare professionals working at the same hospital in Jeddah. I believe this is nothing more than an act of racial prejudice and both myself and my colleagues will be finding another  beach to go to in the future, where the owners/managers/employees are not racially prejudice.On a different note the food available at the so called cafe is  expensive and  very poor in choices and quality!  So if you do go to this beach take your own food and refreshments!"

The guy on the door, who claimed that he was the manager, didn't allow us to enter. Just because ""he didn't like our ID"". Our ID's were official driver's license from Puerto Rico. An no incorporated territory of USA. So, we are United States Citizens. He told us to show him a passport, whom carries the passport in their own country Is important to know that we were inside two hours before the situation. We showed him the orange bracelet, but it was useless. It was racist. I give one star, because there is no zero. Read about United States History and politics. Educate yourself, racist."

We went there shortly after 8 PM, and the tasting room already had a few customers. We were asked where we were from and answered, saying we are from Turkey. We were six people, so started trying the liquor in twos. After two people drank their drink as a shot we weren't given any explanation as to how the drink should be ""tasted"" as you would expect in a tasting experience, one of the two people behind the counter, a bald guy with glasses started going off about how they were not ""barbarians"" there, their liquor was craft and the establishment rejected serving to customers who did shots. We smiled thinking he was joking, and he said he ""was not laughing"" and asked us to leave immediately, which we did after paying, in shock. An old woman behind the counter kept giving us bad looks as we explained what was going on to the rest of our party. Again, they never said anything as to how they expect the customers to drink while they were serving us. Actually, they barely talked to us from the get go. So I guess this place is nice to people if they are white and culturally Christian, a good thing to keep in mind if you are not. I'd sue them if I lived in the Netherlands."

We asked why again just so we could be aware if we did something wrong and he pushed us again. Do not go here, you'll have a terrible time. Should have listened to the reviews on here!"

My friend and 1 visited a few days ago and did not notice any sort of unfriendliness or racism. In fact  there were so many mixed ethnicities in the club that I am surprised people apparently got refused entry  there were Black, Vietnamese, White, and we are South Asian. Anyway  music was AMAZING. A true RnB and Hip Hop club. The DJs really know their music. The setting was beautiful  simple and classy decor set overlooking the river. Clean and open space with plenty of room to dance. Bar staff were efficient considering how busy it was. You can't complain about a big club being overcrowded It just means it's a good place to be. Payment is at the end so yes you can get carried away with how much you are spending overall as you have an individual tab for the night. You are given a card upon entering and you get it stamped at the bar each time you get a drink. At the end of the night my friend and I forgot about our cards and tried to walk out  security directed us towards the back where you pay. Staff were friendly and efficient  no problems at all. I will say however, I dont actually know how much the drinks cost etc  we paid a total of 60 each for the night, and we had 4 drinks each. That  to me  is very reasonable for the type of place it is. If you are looking for a night out on a budget, this isnt the place to go. Dress code  smart/dressy. If I'm ever in Lisbon again I will 100 go back! Miles better than the overrated Bairro Alto and Pink Street "

I'm white and my friends are Indian. They turned us away because of this. After arguing with them because of this, my Indian friends got jumped by the bouncers. We called the police and they were not helpful. They tried to steal their phones and wallets. I tried to step in to stop it and they then jumped on me. So don't go here unless your white. Avoid these people."

While most of us are 20 it was disappoint when only half were let in. My white friends who aren't 21 were let in without being IDed while out coloured friends were let in without being IDed, despited clearly being under 20! Maybe this was just the bouncers attitude but it was very upsetting to experience this overt racism and I would not recommend going to Zouk for this reason"
